      "description": "You're probably hearing so much about meditation and it's mental, physical, and emotional benefits; however, as a Christian, you've wonder if you can meditate while still honoring your Christian faith? The answer is an astounding Yes! In this course, you'll learn everything you need to start an effective Christian meditation practice that will help you to restore your peace of mind, reduce stress, draw closer to God, and find inner healing. Over the past 12-years I have been teaching believers all over the world about the transformative practice of Christian meditation. Many have been healed from negative thinking, chronic stress, worry, past pains, and even found relief from physical ailments and disease. In this course you will learn about the benefits of Christian meditation and how to incorporate it into your daily life.\nDuring this 8-Part Course You'll Learn:\nWhat is Christian Meditation?\nIs Christian Meditation Biblical?\nWhy Meditate?\nHow to Meditate as a Christian\nHow NOT to Meditate as a Christian\nA Guided Christian Meditation Session\nincludes: Control Negative Thoughts Guided Meditation\nHow to Establish an Ongoing Practice\nKnowing Jesus\nKeeping Your Practice Going and Growing\nAdditional Free Resources\nThe course includes videos, handouts, and a guided Christian meditation audio.\n**In addition to this course, I would also recommend taking my Udemy course: It's All In Your Mind: How your Mind Can Sabotage Your Life and Relationship with God. This is a great foundational course as it will teach you how the  mind interferes with your peace, joy, and healing.\n\n\nRead a few testimonials from others regarding Rhonda's courses and Christian meditations:\n\n\nI think the series is great.  It really gave an in-depth meaning/definition to Christian Meditation.  I believe that when people view the series they will see that it is scriptural to meditate.  This is good.  I am looking forward to what other revelations that the Lord will bring me through this.  God Bless You.\n\n\nYes I have listened to your recording and found it to be extremely beneficial and even life saving. By the grace of God, you have given me the opportunity to better handle my restless mind and have made a complete world of difference in life. Thank you so much and may God Bless you always for what you are doing for him…\n\n\nGood evening out here in Switzerland. I started with the first part of your Christian Meditation and I feel so much relaxed. I would like to thank God for sending you to me. I will tell you my story after sometime. Again, I thank you and God bless a thousand-fold.\n\n\nI thank God that I came across your website for Christian meditation and affirmations.  I have used your meditation and affirmations for about a month and have seen a dramatic difference in my thought patterns and levels of stress.  Before I came across your meditations and affirmations I found myself unable to change those self-defeating thoughts and attitudes that kept me stressed out.  I have enjoyed the affirmations so much that I keep one in each of my cars. Thank you so much!\n\n\nGod is using you greatly in this house! We love to start the day with Morning Devotion…We just love the way you set us out to our days by praying God’s protection, promises, and casting out all evil from around us in the mighty name of Jesus…I am an office manager in a church and I find I pray the things in your devotion for our Pastors on my way to work. Thank you for all you have done in our lives. God has used your meditations in so many ways here.\n\n\n\"I have been listening to your meditations for a month or so now and want you to know that your work here is an answer to prayer. I’ve struggled with depression for several years and nothing has helped me overcome it, but as a believer and follower of Jesus Christ. I knew in my heart that there was an answer to my problem. I also knew that the answer would be found in His Word…somewhere, somehow. The last several years I’ve been pressing in to God in prayer, and have made progress with the depression, but it still hadn’t been dealt with completely. Three months ago something happened that sent me spiraling downward to a depth of grief I’d never known before. I didn”t think anything could bring me out of that dark place. One night I continued to cry out to God for help. One morning I felt compelled to sit down in front of my computer and do a search for Christian Meditations (something I’d never heard of before) and was led to your website. Over the course of a couple of days I studied your information, and after praying about it I decided to become a full member. I thank my God, every time I think of you. God’s Word, through your Meditations and Affirmations, has brought life and light back to my soul. While the grief remains and difficulty rages around me, I know I can surround myself with God’s Word by playing your recordings and come away filled with His peace, comforted. Thank you so much for your faithfulness. I pray that God will continue to bless you, as you’ve been a blessing to others.\"",

      "description": "You are probably familiar with Christian Bible study, which traditionally appropriates a Greek worldview. This Greek approach recognizes the ability of mankind to perceive universal truths and concepts. In science, for example, these concepts are viewed as mathematical laws. In the spiritual realm of religion, and specifically in the study of the Bible, these truths are interpretative conclusions that declare the meaning of the text. Thus, theology tends to promote interpretations as truth, which leads to doctrinal positions and promotes thousands of Christian denominations, each claiming to know the truth.\nThis study will take you to an ancient Hebraic approach of searching the Scriptures that uncovers a depth of meaning. This approach understands that the Bible is distinctly different from western literature in two ways. First, it is an ancient text composed in the oriental world. Thus, its worldview is eastern and Hebraic, not Greek and western. Second, its message is spiritual rather than factual, logical, and scientific. The biblical message is delivered in an artistic manner that stimulates curiosity, provokes questions, and invites penetration of a deeper understanding that resides behind the plain and simple words.\nThis course offers video instruction in twelve lessons. If you want to monitor your progress, there are brief quizzes. Dr. Anne Davis will be your instructor. She has a Ph.D. degree in Biblical Studies, has authored numerous books that you can find on Amazon, and offers her research findings on the BibleInteract website.\nThe optional workbook for this course for individual or group study, entitled \"First Century Methods I: Recovering Ancient Methods of Bible Study\", by Dr. Anne Davis, is available for purchase on Amazon.",

      "description": "Paul’s letter to the Galatians ranks among the earliest writings we have from the movement that became Christianity. It therefore brings into sharp focus key issues of theological debate within the early Jesus movement, including how people in this community saw themselves.\nIn this letter, Paul identifies a specific challenge to identity formation in the Messiah that is facing the church in Galatia. The particular question of whether Gentile converts needed to be circumcised, which is the direct impetus for Paul’s writing the letter, provides a basis from which Paul can expound a broader vision of membership in the Messiah community. Arguing against factions that would exclude Gentile converts failing to adopt Torah, Paul masterfully explores the logic of a New Age instantiated by Messiah Jesus, the new requirements for family belonging, and the reciprocal faithfulness of Jesus and believers which is the foundation of righteousness.\nAcross two courses (totaling 37 lectures), Prof. Wright walks students through Paul’s argument step by step, clarifying difficult translational matters, navigating the messy history of soteriology and interpretation since the Reformation. He then clears a path back to the original concerns of the time to help us see afresh what Paul considered the heart of the New Age.\nPart Two, Ordering the Messiah Community, explores the implications of what it means that this new community of believers - marked by the reciprocal faith of, with, and in Jesus – is the single family of God promised on the Old Testament. In what ways does the Jesus movement fulfil the expectations and promises of the Old Testament? How are they to think of ethics and the Law if a New Age has indeed been launched? How does the life of the community result from the work of God’s spirit?\nProf. Wright continues his exploration of these questions, hinted at in Part One, to highlight Paul’s ultimate emphasis on the necessary unity of all believers in Messiah Jesus, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.\nThis course covers thoroughly advanced material, first explored in Prof. Wright's Galatians commentary. We encourage students to proceed through this course at their own pace, and consult the resources provided, such as Greek lexicon and concept reflection prompts. Every effort has been made to clarify the dense theological argument Paul makes in Galatians and bring it into practical application for members of the Messiah community today.",

Within these cultures we will look at 10 Gods and 10 Goddesses for each. So, at the end of the course you will have been introduced to 50 different Goddesses and 50 different Gods across 5 cultures. We will be exploring the most commonly used Wiccan deities spanning the Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Roman and Celtic cultures. This will offer you a brief introduction into each God or Goddess, where by once your curiosity is sparked you will be able to continue researching and building information of those Gods and Goddesses that you would like to continue working with.\n\n\nAlso explored is the concept of the Triple Moon Goddess. The Triple Moon Goddess symbol is symbolic of the stages of femininity, those being the Maiden phase, the Mother phase and the Crone phase. This module will offer you a deeper insight into how Wicca values all of the ages and phases of life, honoring and celebrating each as an important right of passage.\n\n\nAlong with deities, that is the Gods and Goddesses there are also other entities and energies that can be called on as part of Wiccan ritual. All of these energies and entities may be worshiped and invoked to assist us in our magickal workings and our day-to-day practices. These entities can be used to enhance, make more potent and keep safe our ritual and everyday workings. There are several different ways to do this and this is explored further in the Module 'Invoking - Summoning Deities and other Entities'.\n\n\nWe then move onto exploring Angels and the Angelic realms, and from there we start a deep dive into Animal energy, exploring Familiars, Power animals, Spirit animals, Totem animals and conclude with an Animal Compendium that explores the energetic associations and attributes of 46 different animals.",

So this course talks about the important choices we have to make and to learn and understand with what we may be faced in the near future.\nThis course includes the intimate conversations between the seeker and the universe. The relationship that has been developed for over 45 years and how these conscious choices the seeker made, took her to the ultimate freedom.

      "description": "The mystical teachings of Sufism, particularly influential in Anatolia, are rooted in a tens-of-thousands-of-years old knowledge attainment and transfer tradition, which is one of the fundamental cornerstones of Sufism.\nThrough his unique method, Anatolian enlightened ones performed an unparalleled role in conveying the secrets of the Sufi mystical teachings across the generations. The secrets concealed in his teachings are not immediately revealed, and the knowledge they contain is hidden in such language that those who encounter it are often left in a state of shock and bewilderment. Those who strived to understand this language have been able to discover the real meaning hidden within, yet the majority, without making such an effort, took the meaning at face value and accused Sufi of being anti-religious.\nThe saying, ‘The enlightened are not bound by religion’, ‘Feiza kanel arifu arifen hakikaten felem yeter kayyed bimutekadin’, in other words ‘when an enlightened one becomes truly wise, he/she cannot be bound by one belief ’, is the adapted version for Turkish. This saying conceals important wisdom about religions. As we delve into the meaning of this saying we will perceive that the current form of religions is very different to their pure form. It is for this reason that we’ve chosen to explore the deep, mystical meaning of this saying as the topic of this course. Because, even today, religious instruction of the masses excludes the inward, mystical aspects of faith and concentrates on its outward form and functions.",

      "description": "In the beginning, was the word…sound...energy in motion. It begins the process of creation.

Humanity's languages, while beautiful, only express one frequency of our soul. These languages are woven into ego, mind, linear time, and separation. They cannot express the multidimensional soul that is waiting to be embodied here and now. Light Language, or Soul Language, is the uninhibited expression of your soul's holographic intelligence and power flowing through you into this world.  A whole new level of freedom, connection, and transformational power is waiting within you.\n\n\nYour guide, Aaron Pyne, has been given the gift of Light Language through a variety of ancient teachings and activations from the spiritual realms.  Aaron was guided to help others who are ready to begin their process. In this online Light Language course, Aaron guides you through the intellectual understanding, inner transformation, activations, and sequences necessary to unlock this gift within you.",

Join us on this walk through HERstory as we take a multidisciplinary approach and examine the META myth to uncover the mysteries of the disappearance of the Goddess culture and the rise of the patriarchal model of society. This course explores the works of scholars such as Mythologist Joseph Campbell and Archeologist Marjia Gimbutus, who's \"Three Wave\" invasion theory is now supported with DNA evidence.  The time is now for us to fully embrace the suppressed story of the feminine divine, recognize and re-member her role in history, re-claim her name, and re-store her honor. Our beautiful planet, and the very survival as a species may very well depend upon it. (This is an introductory course only. As with any course you may take, to experience it's full benefits, please read / watch / listen to materials your instructor provides. The intention of these materials is to enrich your learning and understanding of what is presented as well as whetting your appetite to facilitate your own continued learning outside of the course.

      "description": "This course is a much important course. Unlike the many other schools which teach karma in different names, Karma vipak is a compilation of various techniques. This course is not found anywhere but still this is one of the finest lessons one needs in their life. This course teaches you how karma flows? How karma acts? From which point does karma come back? The different types of karma and also the remedies to solve your karma. For those who are confused about what karma really is? this course gives a better understanding of how it has been portrayed in various religions.\n\n\nHow did I come to the course of Karma vipak?\n\n\nI was brought in Indian household where the Karma was a loaded word and had many shades and meanings. For example one of the thing about the mother's is anomaly save it is my karma to go through suffering with you as a person and some people say it is my karma and that you have to go through pain and suffering is a strike word which is a substitution for sin and does a many shades the meaning I was very curious about the theory of Karma and started doing a lot of research in Karma. I started meditating and found Karma is a very simple theory of what you do  comes back but you have to combine it with the law of opposite. when that is very clear then it is very easy to understand the law of Karma.  now what you do outside the house comes back to you.  what you doing inside the house comes from the outside so where you do the karma it does not happen but it happens another place and other time.  that is kind of confusing for many people and I actually feel this class will help you to have a lot of clarity about the laws of Karma and how you can practically apply.\n\n\nwhat will you learn in this course?\n\n\n1. how to see karma?\n2. The basics of karma\n3. Type of karma\n4. Karma in various aspects of life\n\n\nThis course will help you understand beyond that too!

Many of us want to pry open our minds, hearts and souls to a deeper wisdom.\nThe mystic poets had direct, intimate connections to the Divine. Their vibrant, provocative language helps us let go of mental striving, and cracks us open to a richer truth.\nI’ve been leading an in-person mystic poetry group for a while and now I’d like to invite you to walk this transformative path, by starting with Rumi and selections of his work.\nThroughout the course I offer guidance in experiencing the rich, direct spiritual life expressed in Rumi’s words. Not only will we read the words, we sit with them, we learn to surrender to the transformative power of mystic wisdom. Letting the words rest in you, and gently opening yourself to hear what speaks to you; this is a contemplative practice.\nMystic poetry has many different facets, and I’ve found that reading the same poem at different times in my life, I encounter new and important meaning.",

Its fascinating, and much more nuanced and layered than imagined. The concept of auric energy is not new. It has always been around, and has been understood to be the essence of our spirit, our souls energy. Our Aura is linked to our 7 layers of energy bodies and our Chakras. When our Aura is healthy, we feel healthy, however when we feel down and out of sorts, this shows in our Aura.\n\n\nAn Aura is read by tuning into its colour. Each of the auric colours possesses a different quality and vibrational energy value, therefore the energy is unique and different within each colour range and each person. There are literally millions of different colour combinations and our auric colours are influenced by everything in our external environment along with our internal thoughts, feelings and emotions which also encompasses our mental and physical state of being.\n\n\nThe size, shape and positioning of the Aura along with the associated colours can all be interpreted and read to provide an overview of what may be going on within the individual that you are reading.\n\n\nThis is a fun and fascinating process that gets easier and more refined the more we practice these skills.",

It is a time for new Christians to enter the community of believers, and for every Christian to focus on repentance and renewal.\nMany people, if they celebrate Lent at all, use it primarily as a time to give up a less-than-healthy habit. But the season includes so much more! There are practices, prayers, and services all designed to encourage reflection and repentance. But these don’t have to be intimidating. This course will help lower the barriers of Lent so that you can enter into this beneficial season at your own pace.\nAlong the way, we will break down some of the assumptions underlying potential resistance to Lent. We will also pay close attention to various themes of Lent, including repentance, renewal, and discipleship, and how these themes can help you develop a more robust faith.\nThis course is designed to be used during the season of Lent, but can profitably be used at any time of year. As such, it is divided into the weeks of Lent, allowing you or your group to utilize the material in a time-sensitive manner, and reflect on it with believers around the world.\nWe invite you to begin your journey through Lent with us!",

As a hypnotherapist, reincarnation seems to be a frequent reality for many clients that do not find resolution to their problems otherwise. Many works describe how events in past lives relate to developments in this life, but here, I attempt to show you more of a theoretical underpinning to the idea of reincarnation and invite you to further dialogue on the topic. In this course I do not show videos of me talking to avoid distractions; instead I use a few generic pictures in some videos, and mostly power point slides to reinforce the points being discussed. PLEASE note: this course does not contain fancy visual aids. We will discuss the idea of duality, which is necessary for reincarnation to be real, but not sufficient. We will discuss some Kabbalistic ideas about the soul, and then the purpose for reincarnation. We then discuss how the teachings on reincarnation were suppressed, and yet, how some passages suggestive of reincarnation remain in the present-day bible. We then discuss three types of evidence suggestive of reincarnation, and finally how this study can benefit us here and now.",

They are always connected to the Divine realms and as such they know the most effective way for us to see and be in our daily lives.\nIn this course we will meet a number of Angels and get to know them on a deep personal level. We will understand the gifts and strengths of these Angels and know how to connect with them. Once we establish these relationships we will be able to come with specific areas of our lives and hand them over for the Angels to get to work for us.\nWith experience, we will come to have Faith that there is no area of life that the Angelic realm can’t help us to improve. This Faith will give us the knowledge that life is not about our doing but about our being. As we hand over the “hard work” of living to the Angels, we will know that our task is to become intentional on the what and why of living and not the how. The Angels will take care of the mechanism of manifestation so that we can be free to live a life filled with bringing the Earth to a joyful place for everyone.\nEach Angel has their own particular genius zone in our lives. Some are better with relationships, some with money, some with mental clarity, and so forth. When we discover which Angel does best with each situation, we literally can have our own personal posse or administrative assistant to help make all areas of our life run smoothly and with Joy.\nLet's discover a group of ready, willing, and able Angels who are here to help you live your life to the fullest in Joy, Love, and Fulfillment.",

It helps us to understand ourselves more deeply and live more fully in the purpose and calling God has for us.\nLearn Deep Biblical Insights and Truths\nKen Winton is a transparent conversationalist; his inspiring teachings have motivated companies of people around the world into living their lives lighter with God.

      "description": "Astrology is very subtle and very confidential. Life time (Span) is especially subtle. It is impossible for ordinary people to predict this. Astrology refers to the life span of human as \"Ayurdhaya\". Human's death is also determined at birth. It is a challenge to predict a person's life. Approximately 32 life time (span) methods are mentioned in the original astrology texts. Many of them have been kept as secret. Out of these 32 methods, I have explained the most important life time prediction methods. You will have to do a lot of calculations to predict the life span. But I have made these calculations system-based and developed an \"Automatic Life Predicting Calculator (ALPC)\" for your convenient. It is downloadable and you can get it. This will save your time. Sometimes there may be a deviation in prediction. This is because of the DOB time error in horoscope and planetary position. I would like to request you to use it only for your astrological research. Thank You! Shivaya Nama!\nImportant Note:\nAs I said before, there are 32 ayurdhaya methods are available. Here I have explained only four important methods. You have to use specific ayurdhaya method for specific horoscope. Since death prediction is very secret and subtle, there is no common calculation or single method for death prediction. The methods I have taught in this course is not applicable for all the horoscope. Other twenty eight methods are still under the research. So I request my students to consider this course as a fundamental course for knowing the basics of Ayurdhaya. If I get the results of other methods, I will add it with this course in future. Take this course only for learning purpose and it is an introductory course for Life prediction.",

      "description": "*******Over 5,000  students are enrolled in this course*******\nMay your meditations bring you peace, happiness, and bliss. SJ\nYoga is a whole life process. Ultimately, there is only one Yoga with many aspects. Swami Rama does a superb job of describing the various aspects of this one Yoga.\nIn this course, over 25 core principles and practices of traditional Yoga are presented as described by the 20th century Yogi, Swami Rama of the Himalayas. Along with each of the 25 presentations, there are 25 (1 each) brief guided meditations/contemplations from Swami Jnaneshvara that bring added life and personal experience to the presentations.\n\nThis course is for those who already have some exposure to Yoga, and wish to explore the subtler principles. If you have ever heard of, or are interested in Yoga as expounded in the traditions of the Himalayas, you may quite enjoy this overview of the essence of Yoga through the eyes of Swami Rama of the Himalayas (1925-1996). Yet, the information and practices of this tradition are universal, and applicable to all people. My most endearing memories are of walks and talks with Swami Rama along the River Ganges, in the foothills of the Himalayas. He held my hand and guided me in the subtler principles and practices of Yoga as practiced by our Himalayan meditation tradition. For over 20 years I have been helping to pass on these principles and practices, which are being highlighted here in this course. It has been widely said that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. Putting this together is—for me—an act of gratitude and love for Swami Rama, the one who showed up in my life, as well as a gift to you.\nWe hope this course gives you lots of 'food for thought' about Yoga and spiritual life. Please use these readings as contemplations, reflecting on the principles in your own words. Then, allow the insights to lead you to silent, wordless inner contemplative meditations. May your meditations bring you peace, happiness, and bliss.\nWe had a lot of fun putting this together for you. For those of you who will enjoy this offering, I am…\nIn loving service,\nSwami Jnaneshvara (Swami J)",

      "description": "Raja Yoga (the yoga of meditation), Jnana Yoga (the yoga of contemplation), and Tantra Yoga (the yoga of the primal energy known as Shakti) are well known paths of Yoga. They are often seen as three separate paths, and one chooses only one of the three. However, some traditions such as our Himalayan tradition view these as complementary. Here, in this course, we will explore how these blend with one another, as they are from the same one root.\nSome Yoga aspirants are unwilling to settle for the shallow waters commonly sought in our modern world of yoga. The most dedicated seekers want the principles and practices of the advanced sages and yogis of the various traditions of the Himalayan masters. Such exceptional aspirants want nothing less than a blending, a convergence of the highest of principles and practices. Emphasizing this pinnacle is the orientation of this course.\nYoga here refers to the systematic process of meditation as outlined in the Yoga Sutras; it is not modern postural yoga, as beneficial as that may be (actually being preparation). Vedanta here is primarily about contemplation as described in the subtlest aspects of the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita; it fathoms the depths of the knowledge of direct experience, not the mere dance of intellectual study. In our tradition, tantra refers to Samaya Tantra, which is a purely internal process of devotion to pursuing Shakti, the creative source of Consciousness, sometimes referred to symbolically as Divine Feminine.\nWhether you are a student of Yoga or a teacher, or both, if you will settle for nothing less than the highest goals of the adepts, the sages, the masters, then this course will lead you toward a greater depth for which you have been longing. The course is presented in four major sections, one each for Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra, and then a section on Integrating the three.",

Movies and television series about their way of life have had a surge in popularity. This online course offers a view into the Viking world and an understanding of its fascinating origins.\nThe culture that arose from this mythology created a self-reliant people with a great need to explore and expand their reality.\n\n\nMy intention is to guide you towards a life of strength and empowered integrity. As you delve into the reality of the Nordic mythology, you may become inspired to live a life without shame and fear. This course contains practical exercises which you can use in your own life. You may also share these powerful ways of thinking and being with others who wish to find their own way and power. By the end of the course you will have practical, academic and scientific knowledge about the Vikings and Nordic mythology.\nYou will, like the Vikings, discover how you can trust, and cooperate with those who share the journey. One of the earliest examples of actual democracy comes from the Vikings of Norway. They had councils which determined the laws of the land. Every free adult, including women, had influence and power in these assemblies. We might say that one of the reasons the Vikings conquered so much of the world was that women were powerful and respect.\nNordic mythology is a complete cycle,beginning with the creation of the universe and ending with Ragnarök, where all the powers of the universe clash in a great battle. In the end, the same powers of fire and heat that created the earth also destroy it. However, you will find that there is always a new hope rising.\nIn this world of mythology there is no clear definition of good and evil. The greatest of the gods can do bad things, yet the vilest of them can save the day and create unimaginable gifts for the future.\nYou will also become acquainted with the idea that the whole of existence can be perceived as a great tree, called Yggdrasil.\nAs you journey through this course, you may be astonished by the depth of insight and wisdom that pervade every story and myth. Your ability to understand humanity, and yourself, will be enhanced and enriched. You can:\n● Become wiser\n● Learn to empower yourself\n● Receive an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the culture that created this mythology\nYou may be captivated to learn how much these myths have, at their roots, a common human understanding of the universe. Perhaps you will find it refreshing to encounter a mythology that does not condemn, nor speak of sin or even right and wrong.\nIn many respects, you will meet a worldview that shares many similarities with science. It is a worldview that also struggles with the conflict between the powers of chaos and the powers of order. However, it speaks in the language of stories and images and through the lives of powerful yet fallible beings who resemble humans. You will even encounter a graphic description of the relationship between the powers of chaos, the powers of order and the human way of life.\nIf you are a scientist, you may be intrigued by the depth of these myths and the practical wisdom contained within them. If you are spiritually open-minded, you may just enjoy them and smile with this addition to your search, your quest for diving deeper into the mysteries of life. And if you follow a specific religion, Nordic mythology may inspire a deepening and renewal of that which you already hold as your belief.\nAs you embark on this journey, imagine yourself following in the footsteps of Odin. By hanging himself from the tree of life, he falls and finds the runes of wisdom and insight. Odin is willing to let go of a reality he already understands, in order to be allowed to drink from the well that contains all the wisdom of the world.\nSo, I welcome you to do as Odin … let go and drink deep from the well of wisdom.",

      "description": "Have you ever read parts of your Bible and found yourself wondering what they mean? Maybe you've heard a preacher give an interpretation of Scripture that doesn't sit well with you. Or perhaps you're a preacher and would like to improve your Bible interpretation skills. The question is: how can we read and understand the Bible? This course will provide you with simple steps to help you better interpret and apply the Bible.\n\n\nThe importance of having a methodology for Bible interpretation cannot be overstated since the Bible was written thousands of years ago. Every message is better understood within the socio-cultural, historical and, at times, geographical context of the people. Therefore, interpreting some scriptures may require contextualisation of the message in the framework of the original writers and recipients of the messages. By getting closer to the writer's intended meaning and how the message was understood, we can interpret the Bible more accurately and apply it to our contemporary world.\n\n\nA Practical Guide to Studying and Understanding the Bible course is based on the Inductive Bible Study (IBS) method and more. It has three stages: the Observation stage, the Interpretation stage, and the Application stage. The inductive Bible study method is easy to follow and takes you from the text of the Scripture to its application. In this course, you will learn to read the Scriptures and understand what they say, rather than what we want them to say, what they mean rather than advance our opinion, and apply them to our context accurately.\n\n\nThis course provides a practical approach to equip you with the necessary tools and techniques to conduct an in-depth personal Bible study. By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\n\n1. Develop a foundational understanding of the Bible's genres, structure, and historical context, enabling you to interpret various text sections.\n\n\n2. Analyse biblical passages, identifying literary styles, cultural context, and theological themes for a deeper understanding of scripture.\n\n\n3. Learn practical skills to extract meaning from biblical texts responsibly using historical-grammatical interpretation and context analysis.\n\n\n4. Apply biblical teachings to guide your personal values, ethical decision-making and biblical worldview development in relation to contemporary issues.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is designed for church members, preachers, beginners, and anyone who wants to improve their Bible interpretation and preaching skills.",

      "description": "Eye of Horus Activation LightWorker™ Series\nChannelling by Carol Ann Tessier\nManual by Carol Ann Tessier and Kim Ora Rose\n\n\n5th Dimensional Energies of Light The New Higher Frequencies and The Eye of Horus Activation\nThe Eye of Horus Activation (EOH) is a gateway that connects you to the 5th-dimensional energies of light and higher frequencies. The EOH Activation provides the opening that creates a reservoir of celestial energy within your own energy field. This reservoir of celestial energy then anchors and infuses your energy field continuing the journey by going out to the universe and returning to you constantly renewing itself within you. Your connection with our Sacred Mother Earth is also strengthened and aligned and our divine earth mother nurtures you. As we build this reservoir, we re-calibrate our physical, emotional, mental and spirit body, releasing old programming, and negative patterns, and creating a stronger foundation or matrix. This in turn activates more of our Divine Blueprint and can connect us more efficiently to our Light body.\n\n\nThis course specifically works with the Eye of Horus energy activation to help you connect to the 5th dimension light frequencies for spiritual development. Connecting to the 5th-dimensional energies will help you recalibrate your celestial body of light so you can advance as a light worker. Working with the Eye of Horus you will be able to increase your base vibrational rate which in turn will upgrade your energy levels, and assist you in downloading new codes to help build a stronger foundation in your matrix energy fields.\n\n\nThis course is a full-energy alignment for your light body. As your light body is brought into alignment with these finer frequencies of light, your awareness and your ability to heal will be expanded.\n\n\nConnecting with these very powerful, amazing energies, you will find your ability to experience peace, joy, abundance and harmony greatly enhanced.\nIf you have currently been feeling the need to: –\nMake significant changes to the way you experience life.\nDevelop your gift of alchemy.\nExplore new realities and energy fields to enhance your healing abilities.\nAccelerate and upgrade your existing psychic skills.\nAwaken your light body.\n\n\nYou will receive a PDF Certificate from White Flame Academy  at the end of the course.",

Learn a few of the keys to Master Biblical Hebrew to Unlock Bible Meaning, with no fuss. You’ll take your new mastery and dive into your own exhilarating Bible Study.\nReviews:\nI learned a lot about using a concordance in this course. The instructor was interesting to listen to and obviously knew his topic.   Theresa K.\nit was very easy to follow, very informative, and very methodical.     Gloria S.\nIt is something i have been searching for, a way to get past the translations and get to the deeper meaning of God’s word. Sheli\n\nI have long suspected that the Adam and Eve story had a much deeper meaning. This course shows that what I suspected was true. An interesting way to look at the story. I am glad I took this course. Joseph W.\nThe instructor was very precise in his delivery and how to check the meaning. It was really helpful to learn the power of the Hebrew behind the words. Phyllis C.\nIt’s a SHAME!..after many bible translations most people still have a blurred “understanding” of what Sam Kneller, so elegantly clarifies in this course. See it for yourself. This is a MUST TAKE COURSE for everyone, no matter their beliefs (or non-beliefs) are. Hey!, if you can’t really comprehend the CLIMAX in ‘the first story’…forget PhDs. Thanks! Jesse C.\nHe explains in very slow and concise manner. Allowing a student to keep up with the lesson. JoAnne J.\nA good lesson on words meaning and how to study them. It is not always what we think or what we have been taught. We need to understand what the authors meant when they wrote this, knowing that the entire was inspired by God for teaching us, correcting us, etc. (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Marcel R.\nI think it is well organized and very informative. I thought the instructor could be a little more enthusiastic but I think that might just be because everyone who teaches now acts like they have just won the lottery. Overall, I think it was great. Myrna P.\nFor someone so old willing to take his time to share his knowledge with the world, he deserves 5 stars. If the video you find it too long, doesn’t matter, pay attention to the materials he has to share. In fact, the aim of this course is for him to enable you to self-learn independently. Shung J.\nFound this course to give a clear and useful example of using the website and tools mentioned. Need to be open-minded and willing to explore the Bible, rather than dogmatic, to get the most from this course. Thanks, Sam, for introducing me to these tools. I look forward to further explorations. Robin S.",

If you have heard about meditation before and always wondered what it is, what it involves and how to meditate, this is the ideal and perfect course for you. You might have tried meditation classes before and might have thought this is not for you or felt it is too slow or felt unmotivated by it, here is another opportunity for you to get involved in a simple and an easy way.\nI truly understand how meditation can be frustrating as it requires certain discipline and regularity to manifest its benefits. But there are many ways to approach meditation and not all meditations are the same and can give you a desired benefit. A guided meditation recorded by a person of higher energies, who has meditated over 23 years- spending several thousand hours in accessing the divine energy will have the capacity to transmit, transform and teach meditation to others in a simple way. By staying open and continually tunning into these higher energies, listeners and meditators can enhance their capabilities and enjoy the desired results.\nBy simply following the 30 days of enlightenment guided meditation in this course, specifically created one for each day of the month you can reap enormous benefits of high energy focused meditation . All you have to do is simply follow the guidance and enjoy the results of deep relaxation, healing, freedom in life and much much more.\nI wish you a beautiful life!\nYour Spiritual Coach\nSmitha Jagadish",

This 13 Moon Pathway can be referred to as the Cycle of Revealing as we work sincerely with the pearls in the lunar mysteries. This course draws from my experience of Avalon and as a Priestess of the Blue Rose.\nAt this critical time here on earth, mother, it is essential that we listen, see what needs to be done and do it.\nThe Medicine Wheel is a healing tool found in ceremonies, teachings and healing and forms a basis for many peoples' spiritual practices. It maps the interconnectedness of all things. It can be utilised as a personal map for your journey through the cycles of life. It can be a healing tool to see where we stand concerning everything and which path to take. You can use this as a therapy for understanding patterns of harmony, health, and dis-ease and knowing where to focus and how to assist yourself on the path to physical and spiritual healing.\nTogether with our 13 moons, we walk the path around the medicine wheel together, intending to heal our body, mind and spirit. Working with shamanism, we journey around the medicine wheel, connecting with each direction. We experience how it relates to our lives; we can make changes that bring balance, harmony and healing to our lives.\nBy walking the spiritual healing path of the medicine wheel and engaging in practices like meditation, shamanic journeying, sound healing, herbal medicines if you use them, and ceremony, we find practical ways to transform and heal ourselves into lighter, brighter, happier souls. We can release the past; we shake off the fears and traumas of our life and the epigenetic wounds of our ancestors through deep healing that shamanic traditional healing methods utilise.\nWe are the people who will choose to raise our vibrations for the good of all.\nDiscover practical ways how the Moon can help connect you to something much more significant and larger than yourself.\n\"Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself and know that everything in this life has a purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences.

This course is intended for you if you are looking to relax, be in your body and enjoy your life.\nWhen you are mindful of your breath and grounded in your body it makes it much easier to navigate everyday tasks and the nuanced dance of relating to yourself and others.\n\nMindfulness is the ability to notice what is in present time. When you notice signals of stress like scrunching up your shoulders or holding your breath, you can pause and make a new choice.\nYou can choose to relax, breathe and drop your shoulders. You can begin freshly.\nMindfulness offers you the option of breaking physical, mental and emotional holding patterns which enable you to make healthy choices.\nIn this course you will learn how to:\nBe present rather than lost in future fantasies or past regrets\nCourse correct physically, feel better and save on health care bills\nFind peace of mind\nExperience more self-love\nHow is it structured? The course is structured into 8 sections so that you can watch it in convenient increments of 15-minutes or less making it easy for you to integrate into your life.\nI suggest that you watch 1 section per week so that you have time to practice. The mind learns through repetition. Practice is essential. The great thing is that you can do these practices as you live your life.\nWhat materials do I get?\nVideos to guide you deeply into restorative practices\nGuided audio meditations intended to integrate your learning\nWriting prompts to inspire journaling\nBonus section from Ken Wells\nBonus lecture from me, Padma Gordon\nI have carefully designed these materials to support you in deepening into embodied mindfulness so that you can live a healthy and deeply fulfilled life. Are you ready to begin? The time is now.",

In it I outline several body-based practices so if you are someone who spends a lot of time in their head then this course would be great for you because you will learn techniques for coming out of your head and into your body. Your body and your breath are a direct invitation into the present moment. This course is probably not for you if you if you are looking for a mindfulness course that is based in chanting or mantras."

      "description": "The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, or LBRP, is the foundational ritual for working in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's system of magic. It forms the basis of a magickal system for invoking angels, banishing negative influences, and connecting to the divine. It has been passed down into numerous traditions including Thelema and Wicca, and has had a profound influence on the entire Western Mystery Tradition. Many modern neo-pagan groups utilize this ritual without knowing it’s origin or meaning. The rituals of practically all modern neo-Pagan groups owe, in some way, a debt to this one ritual, which has been adapted numerous times to different religious and magickal systems.\nThis course explains how to perform the ritual properly, including how to properly form the pentagrams and call the names; as well as the whys and wherefores of the different components, broken down step-by-step. This course was also designed for people with limited resources, time, and privacy, and explains how to perform the ritual entirely within the mind if necessary.\nAs a bonus, this course includes a brief lecture on the history of the Golden Dawn and its significance to the magickal tradition in the West, as well as a discussion of what “Magick” actually is, including a definition by yours truly and a deep dive into arguably the most influential and well-known definition by the notorious Aliester Crowley.\nAll proceed from this course will go to benefit the Pagan Prison Resource Center.",

We say no to a world of Surveillance, controlling every aspect of our lives, and yes to unbridled Freedom. We shall live in a way of Syncronistical flow with Deep Reverence and Trust for, (and as) the Divine Creatrix of our Universe.\nWe say no to the New Normal, and yes to the New Earth, made up of the Multi-Dimensional Reality of life, which honours the Sacred at its heart.\nThis is not the first time that the timeline has split within humanity, between Magic and Technology. It happened before, as the age of Atlantis rose up from the incredibly Spiritually evolved age of Lemuria. Eventually the Atlantean obsession with technology led to a depart from the reverence of nature, and its ultimate demise of falling into the sea, in the cataclysm of the Great Flood.\nIt is important that we do not repeat history, and that this crossroads that we, as humanity finds itself at, signals the dawning of the return of the Wizards and Witches, and the Magical way of life.\nOur world, which is full of incredible advances in technology, must be counter balanced by the deep wisdom of the Sacred Dimension.\nNow is the time to honour and activate the Divine Feminine, in her fullness.\nLearn how to make the steps you need, in order to take your place right here, right now on our sacred, magical and beautiful New Earth...\nEnrol Now!",

Using key Biblical passages as your guide, you will learn how to cultivate greater peace and wisdom in your life as you impress the word of God deep into your heart and mind.\nYou Can Fully Embrace the Benefits of Meditation While Staying True to Your Own Beliefs. Meditation is often misunderstood as either a non-spiritual mental health practice or a mysterious ritual belonging to Eastern religions. In fact, meditation has always been intended as a spiritual practice, but it does NOT belong exclusively to Eastern mystical traditions. Meditation, and the related practices of contemplative prayer and \"lectio divina\" have been part of Christianity from the beginning.\nDaily meditation is a powerful tool to transform our lives and cultivate greater peace and wisdom.  In our modern life, we are too often stressed out, over-scheduled, and unfocused. In fact, it seems life conspires to keep us in this state of unrest.

      "description": "The concept of spiritual healing date back from so many years, all religious people across the world believe that there is some thing spiritual that can and has contributed to healing as long as one believe and act upon that believe. In Christianity people believe that God can heal you of all your sickness without seeing any physician, because he is the alpha and omega and carries all powers or all powers belong to him. Basically spiritual healing can be defined as the direct interaction between one individual, the healer and a second sick individual with the intention of bringing about an improvement in the illness. Mostly sick people believe that another human being carriers the power to spiritually heal them without medication. There are some key areas we all must watch carefully when we want to build our spiritual practice, and that is the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual all this contribute to healing. To conduct spiritual practice you also need to pick your practice, by meditating for 15-30 minutes, play and share thoughts with the divine , say affirmations aloud. You have to create a space for your spiritual practice that you will fill comfortable and practice.\nSpiritual business also need to be promoted to ensure that your target audience know the location of the business and how you operate. I must say that one spiritual business can only be successful based on the performance and how skillful one is in healing their clients. The growth in the spiritual business is increasing daily because a lot of people want to activate their purpose, because going through life is not an easy task and there are people who believe that its difficult to do it alone without having assess to spiritual powers to support you, so many people join christian ministries, others become Muslims and some also join occult associations for power and riches.\nWe all know that there is a divine power that created heaven and earth, the simple principle to live on this earth is to do right and have open heart and the sky is the limit but humanity is involving themselves with all kinds of evil and still expect to be protected by the divine.",

Cords or negative energies can become heavy and begin to weigh you down.\nWhen we do not have positive relationships with others or vice versa, this could be a weakness in our energy field that allows negative energy to enter. Forgiveness issues or attachment to past relationships can also make us vulnerable to energy cords.\nThis three-hour seminar will discuss the different cords that may attach to our energy field and why. We will also learn techniques for cutting the cords and clearing our energy.\nWe will learn to strengthen our auric and energy fields so these cords do not attach. We will also discuss house-clearing exercises.

Whether you’re brand new to the metaphysical path or already a practicing healer, All About Auras is the perfect foundational course to deepen your understanding of the auric field.\nThis enlightening course explores the layers of the human aura — also known as the auric bodies — and teaches you how to identify, interpret, and work with them on a personal or professional level. Through engaging lectures, visual slides, and simple yet powerful hands-on exercises, you’ll learn to recognize the unique energy signatures that surround all living beings.\nYou'll be guided through each auric plane, learning the physical locations, color frequencies, and spiritual purposes of each layer. Discover what different aura colors mean, how they correspond with the chakra system, and what they reveal about emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll know how to protect, enhance, and strengthen your own aura—and be equipped to read the energy fields of others. Please note: while this course provides powerful insight and techniques, it does not cover energy healing modalities like Reiki or yoga.\nIf you’re ready to begin (or strengthen) your journey with energy awareness, this is where it starts.\nTHIS COURSE IS ACCREDITED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THERAPISTS.",

The time has come that we understand times and seasons and move into the purposes of god for our lives, bringing back creation to Glory.\nTIME is the guarantee like a net keeping humanity from entering eternity without God.\nGod manifested in time, taking on the fallen order of man to bring man back to the place Adam lost, the place of image and likeness.\nTime has a beginning and end with appointed set times or turning points, ever progressing to the purposes of God in time. Time can be divided in seasons or generations and life cycles, wheels within wheels that cannot be rewound, progressing to perfection.\nGod came into time to redeem man. Man are responsible to redeem time and step out of the darkness into the light, which opened in the fullness of time. God manifested in the flesh to bring man to the point where the Sons will manifest God in the flesh.",

      "description": "This is a class about living our lives to the fullest. It's about deeply exploring what get's in the way of our inherent peace and happiness.\nAlthough Dr. Joe shares and teaches about his death experiences, he does so in a way that empowers each of us to re-frame our perceptions and truly live more fully.\nDr. Joe has died multiple times which has resulted in him having two distinct types of death experiences. He has had near-death experiences and complete-death experiences.\nHis near-death experiences contain what is normally shared about in near-death experiences. However, he has also died for hours at a time and has experienced what happens \"after\" the typical near-death experience. He characterizes these experiences as complete-death experiences or CDE's, which go far beyond what is commonly shared in typical near-death experiences.\nAlthough he openly talks about some of his profound complete-death experiences, this class is more about how to live more fully. This unique exploration into life is unlike anything else available in the world. You will be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for his next words.\nThe presentation will leave you with profound and deep understandings about life. It addresses some of the core issues that disrupt our sense of peace. It also unpacks and discusses what we unknowingly do that creates most everything that disrupts our lives.\nSimply put, this class will change your life forever.\nIf you are looking for class to radically shift your life, to shake things up and reboot, then this is the class for you.\nSo, what would say if you died and then came back? And what if this happened to you several times? And what if what you experienced was nothing at all like what other people have shared? And lastly, what if what you wanted to share could totally transform someone else's life?\nJoin Dr. Joe on a journey of a lifetime. He will present concepts, models and ideas that will alter your perception and experience of life forever.\nUp until this point in time, Joe has kept his complete-death experiences to himself. He felt they were very private and intimate experiences. He explains that until recently, the environment has not felt safe for him to share the truths that he understands about life as a result of these two death experiences. However, after several years, he finally felt a shift in his field indicating to him that it is now time to share. And so, for the first time in this lecture, Joe openly shares all of his experiences and then takes questions from participants.\nIn this class Dr. Joe discusses his complete-death experiences. These experiences were radically different than the previous near-death experiences. In fact, fifteen years ago, he was declared dead for over 10 minutes, and 12 years ago he was out of his body for over 12 hours.\nThese two complete-death experiences were the result of massive heart attacks which were more anomalous considering the fact that Joe has been a vegetarian for over 30 years. The strange part about that is that after each occurrence, he has become healthier than he's ever been in his entire life. Instead of his life degrading as would be the custom in many of these circumstances, he is actually becoming healthier and younger as a result of these experiences.\nSo, take a journey that will positively affect your life forever. Give yourself the opportunity to hear a perspective that can free your mind and soul and bring a long-lasting peace that will enhance your life, your meditations and your experience here on earth.",

      "description": "A few reviews:\n\"This course was exceptionally comprehensive. I've enrolled in several other courses in the past, but this one stands out as the most thorough. It offers downloadable PDFs for the entire course, which proves incredibly useful for those who prefer to follow along. What sets this course apart is the inclusion of video content where you can see the instructor in action, not just the slides. If you aspire to become a Reiki practitioner, I highly recommend taking this course. I'd like to emphasize that l've dedicated my career to the Spa Industry, serving as an Aesthetician, National Educator, Spa Director, and a licensed Director of an Aesthetics School. With this extensive background in a related field, I can confidently say that this course will leave you well-prepared to embark on your journey as a Reiki Practitioner.\" -Healing Through Change\n\"I absolutely loved this course! You can tell that a lot of hard work and thought has been put into the making of this course. I've taken other Reiki courses and found that this one had more tidbits of knowledge that I was unaware of, also there are somethings I didn't understand before that she took the complexity out of so I finally got it! This in itself is priceless! Thank you for this! I cant wait to see what other courses you have in store!\" -Bernadette H.\n\" Take this course!!! It was mapped out in such a simple and easy to understand way that made me want to keep learning more. I love that everything will remain available for me to go back and watch whenever is needed. Deanna is truly amazing at what she does and has made it so accessible to teach others how to implement Reiki into their lives. I had initial fears before jumping into this course that maybe it wasn’t for me because it wasn’t something I fully understood. I’m thankful that I did it anyway because I believe taking the course will quite literally change the course of my life. I also love that it was self paced and I could put in the work on my own time. I believe Deanna truly wants her students to succeed and will help you along the way! She’s the best and I am lucky to have learned so much from her while taking this course!\" -Stephanie S.\n\"This course is literally for everyone. If you are a beginner, you will get the best Reiki course I can imagine (and I have been a Reiki Master for 10 years and have taken so many courses) - and if you are already a Reiki practitioner, this course will give you new inspiration and even more joy in Reiki. In fact, I would say that the course is so good that it is like experiencing Reiki again for the first time. And that is big. The course is so well structured in a nice, fine balance between text and videos - it's nuanced yet simple, even though it's advanced stuff you're learning. \" -David H.\n\"Get this course!!! Not only is it informative and gives you all the tools you need for reiki, her attunements are powerful! I have been attuned three times and her energy truly blessed me and was the strongest. Highly recommend!!!\" Leah B.\n\"This course is Amazing! Not only does Deanna share, teach and pass on traditional Usui Reiki methods and best practices. Her style of teaching comes from an authentic place. She truly comes from the heart and makes this class feel interactive. I really enjoyed her energy. I look forward to taking more classes from her. If you find yourself trying to decide. Take the leap.

Her gift is because of Him and in order to do the work she does, it requires a connection to God. If you do not like God or want to read or hear about Him, please do not purchase this course. Also know that if you're doing this work without God, then you are passing on false messages to people from a dark source that also knows everything about whom you're reading.  Udemy will not refund your course after you open the course so please be sure before you buy.\nDr Foster Will open your eyes to the spiritual gifts that you are Already employing in your daily life. The information provided in the course will awaken you to the daily goings on that involve spiritual help, guidance, and input so that you may be better equipped to work in your current profession or realize a different path and life's purpose. Dr Foster bases teachings on the information that she has received over the past 39 years, most of which is confirmed by the Bible and other spiritual teachings. Dr Foster's gift is God-given and her work exemplifies God's miracles in everyone's life. She uses her knowledge to create more light workers who glorify God in their work rather than claiming to be all-powerful genies. Dr Foster cannot make you a medium, nor can she make you realize gifts that you do not have. The purpose of this course is to open your eyes to what you already do or that which you can do. Spiritual gifts differ with each person like a fingerprint. One person might be able to comfort people over the loss of a loved one or a pet, and another might be able to lay hands on someone and heal them through prayer or reiki, and yet someone else might be able to use a spiritual gift to lead or be an administrator, or to minister to people.

      "description": "This course is an introduction to the biblical doctrine of angels and their role in God’s plan of redemption. It will explore the origin, nature, classification, and ministry of angels, as well as the reality, activity, and destiny of Satan and demons. It will also examine the various views and controversies regarding angels and demons throughout contemporary culture. This is a beginners course in Exorcism: Masterclass.\nAngels are spiritual beings created by God to serve Him and His purposes. They are often depicted as messengers, guardians, warriors, or worshipers of God in the Bible. Angels have different ranks and functions, such as archangels, cherubim, seraphim, and others. Angels are involved in God’s plan of redemption by announcing the birth of Christ, ministering to Him in His temptation and agony, proclaiming His resurrection, and executing His judgments.\nSatan and demons are fallen angels who rebelled against God and became His enemies. They are the source of evil, temptation, deception, and oppression in the world. Satan is the leader of the demonic forces and the adversary of God and His people. Demons are his agents who seek to destroy God’s work and influence people to sin. Satan and demons have a limited power and a doomed destiny. They will be ultimately defeated by Christ and cast into the lake of fire.\nAngels and demons are not only biblical realities but also cultural phenomena. They have been portrayed in various ways in literature, art, music, film, and other media. Some of these portrayals are accurate and helpful, while others are misleading and harmful.

      "description": "Life involves relating to people. In relating, we often experience conflicts. These conflicts cannot be wished away or dismissed as they bother us. I experience happiness and connectedness with the other only when I am in harmony in my relationships.\nHow can I be in harmony with the other who is so different from me? The timeless wisdom of the ancient masters from India show us the way forward for harmonious living by practising dharma. Dharma is not an abstract concept or a cosmological proposition.\nThis course is a step-by-step journey of the What, Why and How of the ancient, universal guide of Dharma in our lives, now.\nWhile the word 'Dharma' has many meanings, one of the primary meanings is universal values and principles that have upheld society from time immemorial. Hinduism and Buddhism which grew in the heart of India has dharma has its foundation. Our actions on a day to day basis and hence our lives are an expression of the values that we have assimilated well.\n\nThis course is the first ever course on Udemy  by a Hindu monk.  The journey of the course is a simple, yet profound journey of small yet firm steps to discovering that you are the light of dharma and how you can illumine your life and the life of others with your joy and wisdom. It addresses a huge gap that modern psychology totally misses, which is our need for dharma.\nWhen dharma is at the centre of our lives, all the values such as love, acceptance, appreciation, justice, co-operation, fairness flow from the inside out, into all areas of our lives.  To discover dharma as our centre, we look through what being obsessed with work, partner, money or children entails. Unless we see the suffering we are going through we will not be able to appreciate the power of dharma.\nBy doing this course, you will:\nDo what needs to be done as your understanding of dharma grows.\nInvite the illumination of dharma into all areas of your life. This includes the space of self awareness between you the person and the roles.\nSee the interconnectedness of  the five sets of relationships (Panchmahayajna)that you did not know you had.\nChange wisely, in how you give and receive in your relationships. This is possible because of the three powers you have in every situation.\nOpen your heart.\nValue your relationships\nEmbrace them with your thoughts, words and deeds\nRejoice in your life and relationships as the joy and wisdom if yours to claim.\nThis course is a sacred and heartfelt offering to all seekers, of the love and wisdom that I have received from my gurus. The commitment to the tradition is carried forward by sharing it.\nTraditional teaching in gurukulam-s (traditional teaching institutions) is offered free of cost, for years, even in this day and age. It will be my joy and responsibility to contribute to Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, where I studied, from the proceeds received for this course.\nIt is with much joy, warmth and respect that I welcome you into this sacred and consecrated  space of the course.\n\nThe space is sacred because the wisdom that will be shared has been shared by rishis, ancient masters across generations.\nThe space is sacred because you have opened your heart to the possibility of learning and growing.\nThe space is sacred because you are sacred.\nFor, you are as much as I am.\nOm.",

The ancient yogic science of mastering prana shakti, as presented in this 3D animated video course, teaches you to develop a heightened sensitivity to the bioenergetic field within and all around you, so  you can conserve, multiply, and even consciously direct pranic energy!\nI am serious about seeing you succeed in learning this technique; so, in this new set of 8 videos I have included a PDF workbook and an mp3 audio companion for each session, so you’ll have all the tools and resources you need to start your own personal practice and quickly master the science of prana for yourself.\nBenefits:\nLearn an authentic yogic mediation style!\nNaturally triple your vitality levels!\nEncounter your own Atma Shakti (spiritual power)!\nLearn to heal your self and others with prana!\nIncrease your natural energy levels, charisma, wit and magnetic appeal!\nPersonally connect directly to the Unified Field of infinite power!\nHave more energy for higher awareness and to manifest the life of your dreams!\nEnjoy an authentic and high quality exotic yoga meditation course!\nThere is no other course like this on the Internet! Guaranteed! That's because I personally designed, produced and edited this entire video series single-handedly (even learning 3D animation software)! I did this because I wanted to ensure that the quality and authenticity of the final product was top notch, and (most importantly) true to the authentic source.\nYou see, I learned these techniques while living in a very remote and austere yoga ashram in northern India, where these very secret techniques have been passed down in an unbroken oral tradition since ancient times. I have  done my best to present you with these techniques in their original and true form, just as countless others have learned them in millennia past.\nNow you can learn these previously hidden and very secret yogic techniques for your self!\nI am very excited and extremely honored to be able to offer my audience this set of very rare and potent yogic techniques and meditations to give you a powerful first hand personal experience of cosmic power and Universal Energy.\nPrana shakti is similar to the fuel in a rocket; the rocket can only  go as high and as afar as it has the fuel to propel it. By increasing your own vital power you are able to have more consciousness, awareness and wakefulness; allowing you to learn, grow, evolve and interact with life on a much more deep and fulfilling level.\nWith more Cosmic Energy you can quickly notice the opportunities  all around you, as well as more easily remain proactive and effortlessly overcome procrastination. Your energetic reserves are turbocharged!\nOthers will become instantaneously attracted to your higher energy levels, like moths are attracted to light, and will find them selves desperately craving what you have on a very deep subconscious level.\nThis course teaches you how to quickly master the ancient yogic science of prana, vital life force energy.\nFrom the moment you begin learning these techniques spiritual experiences begin to occur with greater frequency and intensity.  Now spirituality is no longer limited to only intellectual concepts and ideas, but has now become a vivid, living and breathing aspect of your personal life.\nEach video in this series builds upon the previous one, gradually leading you towards developing awareness of prana, storing prana within your subtle body, increasing and multiplying your prana, channeling and directing prana for healing, as well as empowering yourself and others with Cosmic Energy for spiritual awakening.\nIn this course, you are presented with a complete systematic path for spiritual awakening.\nThe yogic science of prana is a complete path for spiritual  awakening. As the prana shakti is awakening and amplified, the causal creative force which lies dormant in the human body is awakened and begins ascending and spiritualizing, healing and rejuvenating the entire body/mind complex.\nThere is no aspect of your life that learning this complete ancient  form of knowledge cannot enrich. Just imagine how much you can accomplish with 3 times more energy!\nWhat if you could rapidly increase the rate of healing and recovery for your self and loved ones, no matter what their illness? Even illnesses for which there are no known cures. This course teaches you exactly how to achieve this, so you can heal others with your own touch.\nPrana works on the subtle energy body which is the template of the physical body. By sending pure pranic energy to a certain organ, or body  part, you are revitalizing the subtle energy template and correcting  any distortions or stagnated energy that is at the root of any illness,  injury or disease in the physical body.\nDo your self this favor by starting the 8-Part Zero Point Yoga Video Course NOW and enjoy this rare opportunity to learn an authentic and extremely powerful ancient  spiritual science with only the click of a button!",

These videos walk you through the workbook lessons/Steps.\nBy watching the videos you will gain knowledge on subjects ranging from alcoholism and the nature of addiction. By completing the workbook exercises you will work the 12 Steps straight from the AA Big Book.\nI recommend everyone working in the substance abuse treatment industry go through this entire course.\nThe 12 Steps are deep-dive therapy into the psychology of the ego/mind. The Steps are basically psychological Judo, whereby the user learns to undo the chokehold the ego has on the user.\nLearn/master/fully-understand ego dynamics.\n“If you accept your function in the world of time as one of healing, you will emphasize only the aspect of time in which healing can occur. Healing cannot be accomplished in the past. It must be accomplished in the present to release the future.” ACIM\nTo work the 12 Steps simply watch all the videos in order, answer the quiz questions, and complete the workbook assignments as directed. The whole process should take about 15-20 hours.\nYou do not need a sponsor to complete the course, but you can always go to a 12 Step meeting and get a sponsor if you would like, or work with your psychologist, therapist etc.\nI strongly recommend you go through this entire course before trying to use this course to sponsor others.

I don't know why she gives so much away! I've taken 'all the courses' and this one, by far, has the most value!\"\nMichelle M.\n\"I didn’t have any idea once I started your class how much it would resonate with me. The weeks built on each other, and the assignments were on target with manifesting desired results. The lectures were practical and down to earth. It really is easy to see results IF you meditate daily and clear your chakras. As I continued in the lessons, it became a “guilty pleasure” to dive in each week.\nBecoming my own shaman has helped me to figure out who I am! I feel like it has brought me home to me.\"\nCathy R.\n\"Being able to treat myself, my young daughters, my husband, friends and even clients with natural remedies has been an incredible blessing and I am going to be pursuing becoming a herbalist as well in the future as you have truly inspired me.\"\nRebeka-Lynn M\n\"This course has told me a lot about myself and reconfirmed some of the things that I must continue to Be, Know, and Do. Your goal has been accomplished I enjoyed this course and your guidance and mentorship. Your course is well laid out. The training manual to me is just like our military Standing Operation Procedure (SOP), meaning that if you are not on location with me I can still accomplish my mission. I learned a lot from the videos and your training manual. The things you covered in both the video and the manual such as how to present yourself and the consideration of your client such as not wearing strong scents, and getting their permission when using sage/anointing oils to make them aware of the purpose of usage. The manual along with all of its reference’s and protocol is a must have…I’m saying this because it never leaves you in the blind…it also shows your love and caring about taking care of people and a true shaman quest.\"\nPatrick W.\n*I, Bonnie M.

Perhaps you have been a Christian for a while but have not really had the time or desire to discover the first steps?  Maybe you are just searching for a faith that makes sense? Or maybe you are helping someone else with their questions?\nWhen I became a Christian I knew my own limitations, and I knew that I didn't want to bury myself in the bible and come over 'all religious' to my friends and family. I'm a big picture kind of person, and I just wanted to know who Jesus was, what happened to Him and to gain enough understanding to talk to others about what I had found, in a confident manner. There's nothing worse than feeling like you are the new kid on the block and you haven't a clue what's going on.\nOn the Introduction video - there is also a downloadable workbook so you can record what you have learned as you navigate the varied subjects in the course. It is designed to be very user friendly and easy for you to go at your own pace.\nI am pleased with the content, the pace and the extra fun that the scribbly bonus videos bring - and I hope that you feel the same. I didn't want this to be a 'religious' bible study but rather a fun, inviting and engaging way to get to know Jesus.\nThere is so much to learn and this is just your first baby steps!\nThe Story behind Jesus 101.\nMy good friend and mentor Christine wrote a little discipling booklet called Discovering Jesus 101 and she took my hand and led me into a personal relationship with Jesus in 2010 when I first became a Christian. There are many others who were before me and who followed me. Since she passed in 2016, the little booklet has sat on my bookshelf, a bit dog-eared and very sad looking. What a waste! I wanted to share these first steps. I wanted to put all that she taught me into other new Christians. It took 2 1/2 years on the shelf and then another 18 months in the making, but at last - this video course Jesus 101 - for the new Christian is completed. With blessings from her husband Neale, I took the booklet of lessons, re-worded some parts, added my own experiences, some animated videos, my poetry, my personality and I jiggled the content and came up with what you see here. My husband Philip did a fantastic job editing the videos and encouraging me to keep going. It is a real privilege to be passing her baton and carry on her legacy as she sits and watches from the great cloud of witnesses. I pray for revelation for all who will take the lessons and be hugely blessed by her teaching. She was one of Gods Generals and is still greatly missed.",

Over time your practice of yin yoga can open your capacity for connection, flexibility, serenity, and consciousness.\nAs you progress from a focus on the physical postures to an energetic practice, you’ll use the yin poses to connect with the energy of the subtle body and the chakra centers.\nYin is the perfect balance of anyone with stress, anxiety, a monkey-mind that won't turn off, perfectionists, and those looking to feel more grounded, healed, and balanced.\nUnblock and Heal Your Chakras & Open Up Your Body\n· Travel up the chakras for deep healing, relaxation, and transformation\n· Allow your fascia, ligaments, and places of tension and stress in the body to get fluid and release\n· Improve your flexibility and inner balance\n· Unblock the Seven Chakras to Invite In Emotional Healing and Energetic Wellness\n· Go Inwards and Connect Within\n\nUse Yoga to Encourage Physical, Emotional, and Energetic Healing\nDive into deep, slow, long breathing as you settle into the pose and then come to the point of stillness.

      "description": "How To Win: If there was a Book in the Bible that illustrates how a Christian should live in an overtly worldly setting, then 1 Corinthians speaks volumes and offers numerous tactics to help us navigate such terrain.\nAfter starting the Church (Acts 18) the people continued many of their worldly practices alongside their Christian walk. There was division, selfishness, promiscuity, immorality on one side, and extreme living - abstinence from marriage, food, etc on the other side of the spectrum.\nIn a Church like this, one would have thought the absence of God would be evident. The complete opposite is true.\nThe Church had such spiritual vibrancy that can even make us envious today. God did not condemn them but condemned their practices.\nThrough the apostle, they were instructed to live right, honor God, honor each other.\nThis Book seats as a must-read for all Christians today since it mirrors many of our 21st Century challenges.\nIf they survived so can we!\nAll in all, this results in a life-transforming portion of Scripture that I hope you find deserving to be studied just as I discovered. The lessons are to be applied to our everyday existence if we are to access the power locked up in these words.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne review said:\nI feel this is a good match for me and is an excellent course. - Anna Gaston\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis book illustrates profound truths about:\nLove\n\nSpeaking In Tongues\n\nWorldly Sin\n\n\nThe Role of the Holy Spirit\n\nMarriage\n\n\nFood\n\nLeadership\n\nIdol Worship\n\nTransformation\n\nEnrichment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI sincerely hope that just as Jesus lived with the apostles and transformed them into formidable proponents of the word; we in our generation will release all aspects of our lives to the Holy Spirit. I pray that the word from these teaching will compel you to desire to be more like Jesus!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGet Started Today - Click Take This Course Now!",

      "description": "The Hermetic Principles were brought to us by Hermes/Thoth from the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. They are a set of Universal Laws innate to humanity and are meant to be used as a tool along the journey of life. You can liken our lifepath on Earth to the Hero’s Journey with all it’s beginnings and endings, rises and falls, challenges and opportunities. We are not without the necessary knowledge to traverse this experience; we just must be aware of how to tap into it. To do so is truly to know ourselves. Once we know ourselves and stop agreeing to the opinion of others about who we are, we can access our authentic power potential. This power lives within all of us. It exists in our physical bodies, energy fields, and within the grand design of the cosmos.\n\n\nWe have all heard of the Law of Attraction, but what is the deeper story behind it? What is it that makes everything we experience resonant with what’s going on within us? The Hermetic Principles allow us to investigate the inner harmonics which the Law of Attraction is based upon. Understanding that the Universe is Mental, or a thought in the mind of something much greater. Where everything corresponds to how we show up in the world, or what’s known by the Hermetic axiom “As Above, So Below. As Below, So Above.” The Law of Attraction states that everything is vibration and where we place our vibration is what is reflected in our outer world. And when we think about polarity what we are really saying is that we choose one end of the same stick. Is there really hot or cold or there both hot AND cold? Is it dark or light or dark AND light? There is no hard stop, but a sliding scale of where we determine what is or isn’t. That the Universe has a principle of rhythm. An in breath and an out breath. The ebb and flow. Everything in the Universe is based upon cause and effect. For everything that IS there is a cause to the outcome. Sometimes we can’t even see or will ever know what the cause is, but there is always something which begets another. Finally, that the principle of gender is apparent in our feminine and masculine archetypes. Not based on sex, but on gender. That we all have the masculine and feminine energy within. The yin and the yang. It is about our self-awareness and how we choose to work with those archetypes.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course is intended for students who want to learn about the Universal Laws and Hermetic Principles. In this course I cover some of the most fundamental ancient mystery school teachings and teach you how to use them to your will. These are the keys to absolute transformation and helping to heal our world as we know it. When we understand these principles and apply them to our daily lives, we not only re-create our own reality, but we shift the entire world around us.  This ancient wisdom is made accessible to us, but many do not know that it is. That's why I present these tools for you to learn in accessible and digestible segments."

Students are encouraged to keep their Bibles and note-pad handy for this study, and to review verses in their own time, as to study these topics out for themselves, and not just passively “accept” what is taught.\n\n\nBy the end of the three parts, students will have a solid foundation to build their missionary ministry on Biblical principles, in a way that is approved by (signed off) by God.

Earth is the power of confronting ideas and concepts with reality.\nEarth is freeing.\nIn this class, we will learn:\n• What are the elemental initiations in the shamanic perspective.\n• What are the qualities of the Earth element\n• The connection between your body and Earth.\n• The connection between Action and Earth.\n• How to get back the conscious animation of moving your body\n• How to break old toxic patterns\n• How to identify that the Earth element is unbalanced within you\n• Many practical rituals and ways to use the Earth medicine to heal and reconnect\n• How to create an Earth Altar\n• How to use a Quantum Grid to balance all four elements within your system\n• How to make sure that the soil where you sow the seeds of your visions is fertile\n• How to clear what people call Black Magic with Earth medicine\n• Different ancient secrets from Mystery Schools about Earth medicine\nThis is the first Elemental Initiation and one of the most potent.\nWe have for too long dismissed and forgotten our elemental identity and connection with Life itself.\nWe are so lost in our minds. We are all so easily manipulated by thoughts, concepts, propaganda and marketing. This Earth initiation gives you back some of your power. Because Earth doesn’t lie. Earth is real. And Earth elemental medicine helps you to become real again.\nClose your eyes a moment and ask your body intelligence. And ask yourself:\n«Could I be more connected to the Earth within me? Can I learn something new and valuable from my own earth consciousness?»\nIf you feel there is something for you there, then you know.\nIt is time.\nDemian Haye",

      "description": "Chanting sacred mantras is a potent and immediate way of clearing out negativity in the mind and body, as it opens you up to the Spiritual dimension.\nIn this course, we chant, no less than twenty five mantras taken from the Kundalini Yoga tradition.\nYou will learn how to pronounce these mantras, what they mean, what they are designed to, and how they work.\nThese mantras have been especially picked out because they work, and they work fast!\nJust a few minutes of chanting any one of these mantras, works like a key that opens up the door to the ecstatic experience.\nThe ecstatic experience is when we stand outside of our false self, the ego, and stand inside our true, permanent, eternal being, our soul. Ecstasy comes from the Latin Ex-Stasis - 'to stand outside of'.\nMy name is Mark T.J Keane and I have been practicing and teaching Kundalini Yoga since 2003.  I am your guide on this course, and deep dive into chanting your way back to your soul connection.\nAs you work your way through this course, you will find yourself feeling lighter and shining brighter as all negative thoughts, words and habits disappear. It will purify and cleanse your electro-magnetic field, and your aura.\nYou will find that fear, uncertainty, doubt and whatever you struggle with in life will begin to take a backseat, as you welcome back your true identity to the foreground of your experience.\nIt will safely and gracefully activate your Kundalini Shakti, your serpentine life force energy, and get it flowing through all the chakras, as the mantras are invoking the awakening of the dormant power, the sleeping serpent.\nThis course is especially good if you struggle with your throat chakra and often find it hard to choose the right words to say in the moment.  It will activate your throat chakra, clearing out any blockages, making clear and authentic communication easy for you. This will help you make new connections with people, and deepen existing relationships.\nYou will find that chanting these mantras makes meditation automatic, as it has such a profound effect on silencing the mind, and deepening your connection into the Spirit.\nExperience this yourself right NOW by enroling, you have nothing to lose except what you are ready to let go of, in service to your true Divine self.\nEnrol Now!",

But life is hectic and it can be hard to tune in to these communications -- and to know what these messages mean when you get them. You might even wonder if they're truly real, or if you're just imagining it, making things up and giving in to wishful thinking.\nIn this course, Signs from Spirit, you'll learn about the most common signs you receive messages from, why you're receiving them and how to tap into your own intuition so you know what they mean for you and why they're coming into to your life right then.\nBy learning this, you'll be able to receive more signs and clearer messages. This can help you feel closer to all of life -- your loved ones on the other side of life, your own divine self, and your guides.\nWhat students say:\n\"Loved this course. I've been having signs from Spirit for a while but wasn't sure if some were actual signs or not. This course shed light on my experiences and showed me I was indeed getting tons of confirmation from the other side.\"",

I spent years in Bible college racking up over $50,000 in student debt in the name of Biblical education. I don't think anyone should have to pay huge amounts of money to get answers about their faith.\n★ You're really getting an advanced Christian education at a fantastic price.\n★ You're getting access to a community of believers who come alongside you no matter where you're at in life.\n★ You're getting access to materials & resources you can use in your life & ministry.\n\nI believe: In-depth Christian courses should be available for the price of a good book.\nI believe: You should have access to a safe and loving Christian community that values lifelong learning and spiritual growth - no matter where you are.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING\n★ You're not paying thousands of dollars for college level, Biblical education.\n★You don't get homework, deadlines, stress, or pressure. Learn at your own pace!\n\n\nWHAT THE COURSE FOCUSES ON\n#1 -You will discover what painful, false beliefs you have been carrying with you.\n#2 -You will study specific Bible verses that debunk your false beliefs.\n#3 -You will learn a 3 step strategy to beat painful, negative beliefs.\n\n\nTHIS COURSE IS FOR YOU IF:\n-You want to be more like someone else.-You have doubts & insecurities about who you are.-You feel God is dissatisfied or angry with you.-You have low self-worth or low self-confidence.\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE COURSE?\n★ 5 Hours of Video Bible Study content.\n★ 3 Step strategy to break down toxic false beliefs about yourself and replace them with Biblical Truth.\n★ Group discussion questions and section quizzes to test your understanding.\n★ Life application Challenges.\n★ Lot's of downloadable resources to encourage your spiritual growth.\n★ Access to our Bible Study Group for follow up questions and conversation.\n\n\nI CREATED THIS COURSE TO HELP YOU LOVE WHO GOD MADE YOU TO BE - SO YOU CAN FULFILL THE AMAZING PLAN HE HAS FOR YOUR LIFE!\nGod created you exactly the way he created you, when he created you with a specific purpose in mind. The Bible tells us time and again that God is ready to use us if we will allow him. I have found in my own life that God has been ready to use me, but I wasn't ready to be used. Why? Because I didn't accept myself. I was worried about being too much of this or too little of that. I wanted to be more like the guy on the stage and less like myself.\n\nWhen you're not satisfied with who you are, you aren't fully in touch with yourself. If you can't access your God-given gifts, then it's very hard to allow your true self to be used by God.\nIn ministry, I have seen that once someone fully embraces who God created them to be, they find a significant amount of peace in their life. Many of these people also discover their \"calling\", the type of life path God has in store for them shortly after Accepting their Identity In Christ.",

      "description": "Thoth is the ancient Egyptian God of scribes and intellect, whose name is often associated with figures such as Cadmus, Hermes Trismegistus, Enoch, the angel Gabriel, and Luqman the Wise. Some scholars believe that these figures are incarnations of Thoth.\n\n\nIt is thought that Thoth recorded countless texts covering a vast array of topics that delve deep into esoteric teachings. These topics include the mysteries of the cosmos, alchemy, astronomy, and the intricate landscapes of the human mind and consciousness.\n\n\nWhile most of these texts have been lost over time, a few were preserved and kept hidden for an extended period. Among these texts is “The Divine Pymander,” which will be explored in this course.\n\n\nThe \"Divine Pymander,\" also called the \"Corpus Hermeticum,\" is one of the most distinguished works attributed to Thoth. This text holds a significant place in the realm of esoteric philosophy and Hermeticism, with many believing that it was composed long before the time of Moses.\n\n\nThe text embodies profound philosophical and spiritual insights that have captivated thinkers and seekers for centuries. Although originally attributed to Thoth, it later became associated with Hermes Trismegistus, who merged the attributes of Thoth with those of Greek and Roman thought. This shift in authorship was particularly embraced during the Greco-Roman period, as thinkers, scholars, and mystics found inspiration in the philosophical ideas of Plato and the Stoics. Consequently, this change not only elevated the text’s prominence but also facilitated its teachings reaching a broader audience during the Hellenistic era.\n\n\nThe journey of this text is quite fascinating. It emerged in Arabic and was then translated into various languages, including Greek, Latin, French, and Dutch. However, it didn’t find its way into the English language until the 17th century, when John Everard took on the challenge of translating it in 1650.\n\n\nThis was a significant moment, as it allowed a much wider audience to engage with the ideas contained within the text, influencing thinkers far and wide. The narrative took another intriguing turn in 1945, with the discovery of new manuscripts in the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt, which added further depth to our understanding of this important work and its contexts.\n\n\nThe \"Divine Pymander\" is a captivating blend of philosophy and spiritual wisdom, composed of seventeen books that explore profound questions about the divine, the universe, and the human spirit. Each word is imbued with meaning, inviting readers to look beyond the surface and truly engage with its teachings.\n\n\nThis ancient text confronts complex ideas about existence and morality, leaving a lasting impact on various spiritual movements, such as Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and early Christianity. Its enduring significance is derived from its rich and symbolic language, which provokes contemplation on essential questions regarding identity, knowledge, and the very nature of reality.\n\n\nReviving the \"Divine Pymander\" is like rekindling a connection with a treasure trove of ancient wisdom. This remarkable text invites anyone on a spiritual quest to embark on a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. It encourages us to delve deeper into the divine mysteries that influence our lives and the universe at large. By exploring these teachings, one can cultivate a greater appreciation for the divine forces at play, not only in the cosmos but also in our daily experiences.",

And how can we contact it?\nWhat causes God to intervene?\nWhat obstacles do people have when trying to be healed?\nHow do we know if we have strong enough faith?\nWith real life experiences and extensive work in helping people be healed by God, Chas makes the impossible become probable. Chas has been in gospel ministry since 1997, with a niche emphasis on faith and healing, according to the Bible. He was first an assistant at a church in Houston, then began a traveling ministry for four years, and next pioneered Houston Faith Church, where he has been the senior pastor for 11 years. Several times in his childhood and young adult life he encountered the healing power of God and saw immediate results. And in ministry, Chas has dedicated himself to helping others do the same.\nJoin him in this 12 hour course on the 7 Keys to Heal the Sick and Afflicted. The class is sectioned into EIGHT, 1.5 hour long video teachings, including Q&A and practical application. Students will feel as if they are in a classroom setting with other students, as the school is filmed from an actual 8 week class taught at Houston Faith Church. The response and results that students have had has been so good that we decided to make this school available to the public.\nAlso included are teaching notes with all scripture references included, as well as a detailed chart of all of Jesus healings, methods, keys, catalysts, and results.\nIf you are a believer in Jesus Christ who wants to understand the power of God, how to do the works of Jesus, and how to pray more effectively for people in your life, then you'll love this school!\n\"I have watched and heard many many teachings on healing and I believe yours is the best I've seen yet as it answers and addresses many of the obvious failures in getting Christians healed.\" DB - New Zealand\nA good target for completion would be 8 weeks, assuming one 1.5 hour lecture (and study) per week.\nAdded bonus: Pastor Joni Stevenson is a guest teacher in this series...and you'll love her fire!\nInstructors are available for questions, messages, or one-on-one guidance through the course. Email is the most appropriate method of contact.",

      "description": "Paul’s letter to the Galatians ranks among the earliest writings we have from the movement that became Christianity. It therefore brings into sharp focus key issues of theological debate within the early Jesus movement, including how people in this community saw themselves.\nIn this letter, Paul identifies a specific challenge to identity formation in the Messiah that is facing the church in Galatia. The particular question of whether Gentile converts needed to be circumcised, which is the direct impetus for Paul’s writing the letter, provides a basis from which Paul can expound a broader vision of membership in the Messiah community. Arguing against factions that would exclude Gentile converts failing to adopt Torah, Paul masterfully explores the logic of a New Age instantiated by Messiah Jesus, the new requirements for family belonging, and the reciprocal faithfulness of Jesus and believers which is the foundation of righteousness.\nAcross two courses (totaling 37 lectures), Prof. Wright walks students through Paul’s argument step by step, clarifying difficult translational matters, navigating the messy history of soteriology and interpretation since the Reformation. He then clears a path back to the original concerns of the time to help us see afresh what Paul considered the heart of the New Age.\nPart One of the course, Identifying the Messiah Community, covers Galatians up through 3:18, focusing on the formation of an inclusive community, with a proper understanding of ‘faith’ and ‘righteousness’ as terms of social definition. What does it mean to be individuals ‘in the Messiah,’ and how does this relate to the promised family of Abraham? The inter-faith squabble of Galatians affords modern readers a window into the earliest working out of crucial Christian theological matters such as the Trinity, Incarnation, Atonement, and ultimate destiny. As such, it is indispensable for today as a document establishing the very foundations of our shared life in Christ.\nThis course covers thoroughly advanced material, first explored in Prof. Wright's Galatians commentary. We encourage students to proceed through this course at their own pace, and consult the resources provided, such as Greek lexicon and concept reflection prompts. Every effort has been made to clarify the dense theological argument Paul makes in Galatians and bring it into practical application for members of the Messiah community today.",

      "description": "Do you long for an intimate connection with God?\nWould you like to know how to hear from God regarding the direction you should take in life?\nLearning and practicing the ancient Christian spiritual disciplines leads to a deeper, interactive relationship with God in Christ Jesus. Many Christians don't know how to engage God. They do all kinds of things but to no avail. God desires for us to pursue Him, to go deeper in our faith. He wants to interact with us, guide us, and train us in righteousness. Practicing the spiritual disciplines is for every Christian through the ages to develop the fullness of the Christian life.\nIn this course, you will learn 9 overarching disciplines using the acronym C.H.R.I.S.T.I.A.N. to help you remember them.\n\n\nC = Confession (Personal, Familial, National)\nH = Holy Spirit (Guidance, Wisdom)\nR = Repetition (Memorization, Meditation)\nI = Interaction (Bible Study, Prayer)\nS = Service (Daily, Church, Community)\nT = Togetherness (Worship, Fellowship)\nI = Identification (Communion, Baptism, Witnessing)\nA = Abstinence (Fasting, Solitude, Silence)\nN = Needs (Love, Giving)\n\n\nSome of the disciplines should be practiced daily, some weekly or monthly, and some annually. All will take discipline to master. Some disciplines will replace or push aside present activities and some will war with the way you or your culture thinks and acts. But these changes are for the better. They will mold and shape you into solid, mature Christian.\nThe ultimate goal of this book is to push past the beginning stages of the Christian life into a deeper relationship with God. Join me today on your new journey forward with Christ.",

      "description": "There are many approaches to help people who struggle with anxiety and depression. This class is designed specifically for people who are sympathetic to Christianity.  The primary tactic of the class is to help you change the way you think. Right thinking will lead to right living that is less stressful. You will be taught that the pain and discouragement you are experiencing are not the problem, it's how you interpret the trouble in your life that matters. You will be taught very specific steps to interrupt you anxiety and depression, so that you can reinterpret the problems of your life in the light of how God sees you. Once you realize it's not your job to carry all the trouble yourself, you will begin to feel relief. One of the techniques that is presented in the class is the use of our music therapy to help you begin the process of letting go of the situation and trusting that God will take care of you. When you are feeling overwhelmed you simply begin listening to the included 33 minute music therapy song (It's designed to be listened to as you are going to sleep...but you can listen to it any time.) The song is designed to use concepts in the Word of God, and implant the concepts in your mind through music to help you begin the process of changing the way you think about your situation. This song has many individual songs embedded within it. We have included all of the individual songs for you to listen to. Find the songs that speak to you and listen to them over and over. They are meant to be used to break up the repetitive negative thoughts that you are having. All of the included lessons are practical and actionable. They are all designed to draw you toward trusting God more than you ever have, while moving away from your emotional assessment of your problems. Emotions are not facts and cannot be trusted to be used to interpret our pain. As a bonus, this class also includes a free PDF book that I wrote that describes my personal path out of depression (you can find it in lesson 4.)",

      "description": "A Course in Miracles Intensive – Description\nThis is an intensive course for those who are truly serious about transcending the world (Ascension). It follows a specific curriculum designed to train consciousness to think in alignment with the dimensional perspectives of the Spiritual Universe. While there are many layers of insight you can gain, its ultimate intention is for the greatest goal: awakening and Ascension—something you are fully capable of achieving in this lifetime.\nNote: This course is not for beginners. A beginner-friendly course is now available in the Bio page: A Course in Miracles Experience.\nA Spiritually-Guided Experience\nAll of our courses are completely unscripted. Each course in this series is recorded back-to-back, which is why they feel so interconnected. Every teaching is shared as a wholly spiritual, guided experience—direct, alive, and in the moment.\nA Daily, Transformative Practice\nThis course is structured as a year-long, daily practice with multiple formats to help you fully immerse in the teachings. While the setting is unconventional—delivered through recordings instead of in a church, temple, mountaintop, or with a guru—the journey is not outward, but inward. The path is not in me, not in any building, but within you.\nThe Language of Spirit\nThe essence of this course uses “Christian” terminology. However, it’s important to note that most mainstream traditions under that name do not claim this as their source. The goal here is not to spread worship of dogma (which has its own beauty), but to offer the opportunity for actual first-hand experience of “Christ” and “God” (by any definition)—so that you may discover the Truth directly for yourself.\n\n\nReminder: This course is not for beginners. Please see the beginner’s course in the Bio page if you are just starting out: A Course in Miracles Experience.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to \"A Course in Miracles\"\n“This is a course in miracles. It is a required (inevitable) course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you may elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s Presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.\nThis course can, therefore, be summed up very simply in this way:\nNothing real can be threatened.\nNothing unreal exists.\nHerein lies the Peace of God.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is possible to begin this course with no prior introduction or experience, the truth is that you will only receive as much as you are willing to invest. Many participants enter seeking happiness, peace, health, or success—and these are all very real outcomes. Yet the greater possibility here is transcendence itself.\nIf you expect to maintain your current life structure while simultaneously transcending it, then you may have misunderstood what transcendence truly means. To “transcend the world” is to leave behind everything you know as physical, entering into an additional experience of eternal life within the Wholly-Spiritual Universe. When you reach that threshold, you are given a choice: to remain in that state permanently, or to return and share what you have discovered. If you return—as I have—you do so as a master, able to step back across the threshold at any time. Though the decision rests with your divine purpose and free will, the aim of this course is to guide you to that very doorway, while also cultivating happiness, peace of mind, and the daily experience of miracles along the way.\n\n\nThe Meaning of Ascension\n“Ascension” is a symbol pointing to something beyond words. Put simply, it is the shift of your reality from one plane of existence into a more liberated one, governed by universal laws that may appear paradoxical to the mind left behind. To achieve this requires retraining your consciousness to think in harmony with these higher laws.\nThis is perhaps the most difficult task for a mind that believes itself to be human, because it requires questioning and transforming every core belief you hold about yourself, the world, and God. In essence, the way you currently believe these things to be is exactly why you experience the world as you do.\n\n\nWhat This Course Is (and Is Not)\nThis is not a course on how to manipulate the spiritual universe for personal gain. While abilities of that kind may naturally unfold, the true purpose here is to retrain your consciousness to align with the natural experience of the Wholly-Spiritual Universe. What you discover will open into a journey beyond manipulation—one that is rooted in Truth.\n\n\nWhy Study with Rev. Devan Jesse Byrne\nWhy take this course with me? Many can speak well about the path, but few can teach from direct experience. I cannot hand you the Truth, but I have built this course so you can prove it to yourself through your own evidence. You can only be guided as far as your teacher has walked, and I have walked every degree of this path—including the final step of escaping the world entirely. For that reason, I can say with confidence that you can achieve the awakening you truly desire if you are honest in your practice. Even if this is not your first time with A Course in Miracles, it may well be your last.\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThis intensive course is divided into twelve parts, each spanning thirty days. Every day you will engage with six unique formats—lectures, techniques, readings, prayers, and meditations—each designed to correspond to that day’s lesson. These range from quick 5-minute practices to immersive 60-minute experiences, giving you both variety and flexibility.\nEach week includes bonus content such as diagrams, worksheets, and guided conversations to deepen your understanding and increase your likelihood of success. The journey continues to grow as new supportive materials are added throughout the year, further enriching your experience.\n\n\nPace and Access\nThe course is designed to be completed at your own pace, with a maximum of one lesson per day, at any time that works best for you. With lifetime access, you can return and re-immerse yourself as often as needed—and even pass it down to your children, giving them the opportunity to continue the journey for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n“This course is not ONLY for Peace and Happiness…” ~ Rev. Devan Jesse Byrne\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Get Out of This Course\nWhat you gain from this course depends more on your own desires than on the information itself. We will guide you in training your mind—but how you choose to use that training is entirely up to you. The only true obstacle between you and anything you want is your own definition of yourself.\n\n\nHere are some of the practical and the more abstract possibilities you could achieve through this work:\nThe Practical\nHappy Living\nPerfect Health\nPeace of Mind\nPersonal Mastery\nEmotional Mastery\nFocused Awareness\nFreedom from the Past\nSuccessful Productivity\nManifesting Your Dreams\nFreedom from Addictions\nLiberation from Pain and Suffering\n\n\nThe Abstract\nAstral Travel\nRisen Vibration\nPsychic Abilities\nPhysical Healing\nDivine Realization\nCommunication with God\nMastery of Energy\nBreaking Physical Laws\nExperiencing the Spiritual Universe\nTranscending Beyond Dream-Reality\nAscending the World Entirely\nNo matter what, one outcome is certain: a better life is inevitable.\n\n\nPractical Incentives\nThis course can be taken completely anonymously.\nLearn at your own pace—and revisit the material as many times as you’d like.\nDiscounts available through direct communication, with lifetime access guaranteed.\nAccess easily from any computer, smartphone, or smart TV.\nEnjoy written Q&A and occasional live Q&A discussions.\nReceive optional daily email reminders with additional supportive material.\nBenefit from Udemy’s 30-day money-back guarantee for peace of mind.\n\n\nApplication Assistance\nWhile this course may appear to share many “facts” about how the universe works, it is not about memorizing concepts. Comprehension is helpful, but not required. The purpose is to train your mind to directly experience the Truth for yourself. This training requires shifting perspectives into alignment with what is to be achieved. To assist in this process, the course rests on a few fundamental principles.\n\n\nWe have gathered these principles into the acronym GLORRE (pronounced Glor-RE):\n\n\nGuidance – Opening to your intuition and spiritual guidance, often called the “Holy Spirit,” better described here as the “Wholly Spiritual Universe.”\nLove – The pure essence of what we are, most accurately expressed as the presence of Love, often called “Christ.”\nOneness – Realizing that all lessons point back to the truth that we are one essence, inseparable from the totality of the universe. This becomes clearer with an understanding of “dimensions.”\nReflection – Everything you see and experience is an extension of your perceptual consciousness—a reflection of the mind, much like a dreamer’s dream.\nResponsibility – True progress comes when you accept full responsibility. Your achievement in this course will reflect how deeply you embrace this.\nEternal – Ultimately, you are recalling your vision as an eternal being. This course emphasizes joining again with that reality.\n\n\nTo make it simpler, the core application of this course can also be remembered with another acronym: FOR. Together, this creates FOR GLORRE, an easy way to recall the principles.\n\n\nForgiveness – Learning to release the past, the future, and everything that seems to hold you back.\nOpenness / Acceptance – Applying forgiveness with a spirit of open-mindedness and unconditional acceptance of all you experience.\nRelaxation – Bringing forgiveness and acceptance into the present moment so fully that you can relax—even out of the body—whenever you choose.\nThese principles—FOR GLORRE—are not meant to be debated intellectually, but experienced directly. The conscious decision for ascension becomes possible only when you are willing to recognize and admit such truths. Through practice, these principles shift from ideas into living reality.\n\n\n\n\nReminder: This course is not for beginners. Please see the beginner’s course in the Bio page if you are just starting out: A Course in Miracles Experience.\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\nEach part of this course spans 30 days of lessons, lectures, and supplemental content. New materials—including daily conversations, weekly Q&A discussions, and more in-depth teachings—are continually added, even after publication. If you would like to suggest a particular approach to enhance the teaching process or to participate in the Q&A, please feel free to reach out with your ideas.\nThis course includes a required reading of the A Course in Miracles textbook, available in hardcover, softcover, MP3, and PDF (the PDF is provided). While the text lays the foundation, this course primarily focuses on the Workbook for Students, which applies the text through first-hand experience. Each daily lesson includes multiple components, described below:\n\n\nDaily Lesson Reading\nCan be done anywhere.\nProvided in Video, MP3, and PDF.\nEach lesson of A Course in Miracles in its purest form.\nA form of spiritual psychology designed to bring about divine experiences.\nDaily Discussion (10–30 minutes)\nCan be done anywhere.\nProvided in Video, MP3, and PDF.\nFresh interpretations of each lesson from multiple levels of awakening, helping you recognize where you are and how to proceed further.\nDaily Lesson Application Meditation (30–60 minutes)\nBest done alone.\nRequires headphones or a stereo system (large headphones with bass recommended).\nProvided in Video and MP3.\nTwo meditation styles included:\nPassive: Can be listened to on loop while doing anything, but most effective in a relaxed state.\nActive: Focused attention with specific visualizations, phrases, or guided inquiry.\nDaily Prayer (2–5 minutes)\nCan be done anywhere.\nProvided in Video, MP3, and PDF.\nA simple prayer applying the day’s lesson.\nDaily Application Exercises (5–20 minutes)\nTo be done as directed.\nProvided in Video, MP3, and PDF.\nA variety of energetic and mental practices designed to embody the lesson and prepare for deeper experiences.\nDaily Intensive Teaching (5–20 minutes)\nCan be done anywhere.\nProvided in Video and MP3.\nIn-depth discussions of the core philosophy and mechanics of the lesson, expressed through multiple approaches, languages, and visual diagrams.\nThis multi-layered curriculum is designed to engage you on every level—mental, emotional, energetic, and spiritual—so that each day becomes a doorway into greater awareness, healing, and transformation.\n\n\n\n\nCommitment Required\nTo properly engage with this course requires a serious commitment. Please be sure to watch all of the introduction videos before beginning, as they set the foundation for the journey ahead.\n\n\nCertification\nUpon completion of all twelve parts of this course, you will receive a Certificate of Completion, along with recognition as a Certified Teacher of “God” and A Course in Miracles.\nWhile the ultimate goal of this course is ascension, even if that is not reached on your first attempt, the path does not end there. Becoming a teacher for others is the natural next step—an opportunity to share what you have learned, guide others, and strengthen your own awakening through teaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll textual quotes from A Course in Miracles are copyrighted ©1992, 1999, 2007 by the Foundation for Inner Peace, 448 Ignacio Blvd., #306, Novato, CA 94949, used with permission, and acknowledged here out of respect.

      "description": "Every day of your life, every moment of your existence should be spent on enriching your spiritual self. However, many of us find ourselves pursuing careers or prospects that may give us some financial security but no real spiritual fulfilment. You may be trapped in a job that stifles you and prevents you from expanding your cosmic consciousness. This can and will impact you, your family and your personal life as you strive to live an existence that is against your true divine inner nature.\nNamaste, we are the Aaiyyan World Foundation. We have helped countless people trapped in the material world, find true spiritual fulfilment. We have trained thousands to become Dravidian Spiritual Healers in India and around the world. We have transformed the lives of many who were stuck in a dead material existence, and liberated them in the name of Murugan Aaiyyan - the master of Jnana Yoga - the Yoga of Knowledge.\nWhat we, as Draividian Aaiyyanists have discovered in the process of teaching for thousands of years, is that it is simple to change someone's mindset from the material plane to the spiritual one… but also to pursue a career as a Healer that will not only benefit others, but yourself in this and subsequent lifetimes. You deserve to have the financial freedom to pursue your spiritual goals. We can give you this.\nThat is why we have created the Certified Aaiyyanist Healers Course. In this course we will teach you everything you need to know to perform a full Aaiyyanist Healing session, up to an Acharya Level. We will distil thousands of years of learning into a manageable course that you can commit to memory (both your physical and spiritual memory) so that you may recall it for the rest of your life and your future incarnations. Once you complete this course you will be able to practise as an Aaiyyanist Healer and teacher in your own right. You will be certified and mentored by the Aaiyyan World Foundation, so that your spiritual development will transcend.\nYou will learn powerful Yantras that can heal issues with any parts of the body as well as bind you spiritually with various Lokas (positive dimensions). Once you are bound to these dimensions you will be able to command and master powerful energy forms that are housed in these realms and use them to heal, bind you to Brahman, protect you from entities, and block any negative spiritual control or curses that maybe placed on you.\nWe will also teach you how to perform a remote healing session, spiritually and physically regenerate a client, protect yourself and your client from evil and curses, and expand your consciousness to become One with Brahman.\nOnce you master these skills and more, you will be able to travel the globe both physically and remotely and offer your highly sought-after healing services to the wider public. This will not only benefit humanity but uplift you spiritually and transport you to regions of the sacred cosmos that have seldom been visited.\nThis is just a small fraction of what you’ll learn in this course. It covers so much more. It is 10,000 years of real-world ancient healing experience boiled down into one super-comprehensive spiritually compact course that will guide you step-by-step to gain the spiritual freedom that you have been dreaming of. We also know that many of you live in the material plane as well as the physical one and we will teach you how to fund your Spiritual Healing Practise so that you can have the financial freedom to pursue your spiritual dreams. Also, as a qualified Acharya Level Aaiyyanist you will have the backing and guidance of the Aaiyyan World Foundation and also benefit from being wholeheartedly part of a rich community of the many Aaiyyanists around the world.\nDo not continue to suffer in an existence that is not part of your destiny in this incarnation. Do not continue to waste this life in the pursuit of something that is meaningless and material. Do not continue to worry about your financial situation instead of your spiritual one, when you can solve both by becoming an Aaiyyanist Healer. Take the Certified Aaiyyanist Healers Course now and liberate yourself.",

I explain, how to see and transform energies, how to travel in other worlds and how to clear fields and energy systems. You learn how to activate inner life changing processes and may feels the initiation of your own. You learn everything about purification as the first step. For navigating gracefully through your further process I introduce important shamanic tools like incense and powerful healing plants.\nA shaman is able to see things, facts, energies and emotions, other people cannot see. They can feel into the energy system of another person. So they can help them to dissolve conflicts, for example, by guiding them into their issues and showing them tools and the way out of their conflicts. That can be intense inner journeys that often lead to inner realizations and wisdom. We learn as we grow. We all have the gift inside us to support other people in our unique way, guided by love and a pure intention. We reach our abilities by working on ourselves. The way we discovered and that actually works, we can show to others.\nFind your own abilities in this course, actually find your magic and whole being in this deep spiritual tradition. You may realize what kind of power you carry insight and what your gift is you want to share with the world. It´s all about consciousness. Explore the universe and see what´s possible to grow and free yourself from inner limitations and beliefs.",

There are also believers who have never been taught the full message of the Gospel. Did you know that Yeshua (Jesus) taught a Gospel message that is all about the Kingdom and how we are to live in this Kingdom as subjects to our King? There is far more depth to this daily relationship than just a “one-time prayer” for salvation. That prayer is an invitation to a daily relationship with the Father. Please keep in mind, for this course, and me personally, I fully believe that salvation is by grace through faith. With that said, I also believe that faith without works is dead. This course will show you how Paul and James work together beautifully. This course will set you on a journey of discipleship, learning how to walk The Way of Messiah. Growing closer to the Father along the way. This course will not go through all of the deep details, but rather will give you the tools to begin this journey with the Lord. I hope that I will give you just enough answers to begin you on a journey of discovery to deepen your relationship with the Lord. All glory to the Father.",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED\nWhat we learned as children is much different than how we may feel about it now as adults. This course is an opportunity to move passed the limitation of programming to choose how you want to embrace the light of love and feel better and even closer to God, Light, Source Energy, Nature and the Universe! Empowerment begins when we begin asking ourselves questions that focus our mind on what we believe, why we believe it, and what changes we would like to make to it to bring it into harmony with who we see ourselves as as adults.\nIf You Have Felt:\nGuilt for your practice, guilted by religious others or shamed for your spirituality\nConfusion about God\nNot sure if your spiritual practice is compatible, or ok’d by God\nAsked yourself if you will go to hell for your spirituality, or told you will\nAsked if your practice is demonic\nFelt you have to be in a religion to be able to claim a relationship with God\nAre a medium or foreteller of events and feel judged by a biblical verse or religious people\nIf you want to feel a closeness to God while being on your own journey\nTell Me More:\nIn this course the theology (nature of God and belief) will be discussed in parallel with spirituality and spiritual practices. Religion and spirituality have always had a symbiotic and challenged relationship. Each giving each other notes on perceived flaws. In my practice I have had many conversations with those spiritual in nature, non-religious, and wanting a closer relationship with God, but feeling distanced as though they are somehow in disfavor, cannot have a relationship with God while being spiritual in nature. Some feel they have to be religious to move God into their everyday life and they have no interest in being religious, and yet they do want God in their life. In essence, they do not see God as religious orders do, and that keeps them distant. Still the desire to be close is there. Some struggle with old programing, guilt, shame and judgement that creates inner conflict with their beloved spiritual practice.\nThis fast-track course will take you through many key facets involving spiritual life, mainstream questions many have, religious biblical support of why its ok to love your spiritual self and practice, healing in the bible, our mission to heal approved by Jesus, how to use the bible and so much more.\nThis course is open to all beliefs and shares biblical knowledge with the understanding that some beliefs may be challenged. My mission is to share what I know and how I have processed and live in my spiritual practice, combining theology with spirituality with peace and love, while feeling a closeness with God, spirit, nature, the Universe & Great Invisible Spirit! Whatever name you call God by! This course is not a course on religion or the bible perse, although they are discussed at length. This course is about God's place in our spirituality and practice.\nAll Courses Are Accredited Through International Association of Therapists (IAOTH)\n\n\nDisclaimer: This course is to expand thought, not to convince or biblically battle religious zealots. I fully understand interpretations vary and that some will say there is no such thing as interpretation (I cover this also in the course).  My interest is in sharing how I reached love, healing, deprogramming others view of God within me, so I can have God in my life in the most organic way-through a personal relationship, not according to others rules of how it is done. I share and release. You may be triggered, see things differently, hold your own view even after I share mine, and I praise you for that. Own your power, and keep it peaceful. Sufi",

This is for those new to student ministry, part-time, volunteer, or bi-vocational student pastors. This will equip those who never had the opportunity to go to bible college or seminary. This is not theory. This is my experience from over 15 years of working in the trenches with students. I promise this course will sharpen your tools and help you love students better. If you are not satisfied, then I'll give you a full refund. That's how much I believe in it.\nI will walk you through the five steps to create a healthy student ministry:\n1. Creating an Authentic Grace-Filled Environment\n2. Facilitating Real Connection\n3. Creating a Service that's Worth Coming to.\n4. Equipping Students for Success.\n5. Building a Dream Team.\nI don't believe a healthy ministry can be built without all of these pieces functioning. The ultimate goal is to help students walk with Jesus. These are the milestone on the pathway to get them there. Follow the path and see what God does through you.\n\nIf you are ready to learn, grow, and see student's lives changed then jump on in! The water's nice. If you have any questions or need anything just message me. I am excited to walk this journey with you. Be blessed today.\n*P.S. If you enjoy this course, I'd love to hear from you. Leave me a review and message me what subjects you wish I had covered and I will include them in my course. Thanks and Be blessed today!\n\nChris",

It is designed with insight to aid people in deciding if they are called to Ministry or not. And it is designed to prepare and empower Ministers and Church leaders to be effective and successful for their Kingdom work. It's highly Bible-based as well as experience-based, as Chas and Joni Stevenson have combined their 30+ years in Ministry to unmask the reality behind the scenes (behind the pulpit). Just what are Ministers all about? And what really must happen from heart to house to pulpit?\nIf you're serious about serving God, you'll love these classes, as they were taught live to a group of about 70. There are about 20 hours of instruction spread over 22 videos, each video being personal and engaging.\nA Minister's Handbook (eBook manual) is also included in the course, which is a comprehensive reference compilation of the content.\nEvery Minister of the gospel will benefit from this course. And every sincere believer who feels a call to Church leadership will benefit from this course.",

      "description": "Much has been written about Mary in recent years. Hundreds of spiritual teachers have spoken about her wisdom. Spiritual teachers, best-selling novel writers and film directors have had their part to play in bringing Mary into the public consciousness. Might there then a need for another course or text exploring who she was–or is?\nIf we can start with an open mind and heart to the possibility that her that her role in at least the Christian story almost rivals that of her master, the answer has to be a resounding yes! Mary’s mission, message and example would then need to be shouted from the rooftops. Her rightful place as a model disciple, insightful teacher, and perfected human would need to be well understood and followed. As a part of this, her understanding of the mysteries of the teachings of her time would need to come into the light. We might then come to see that Mary is more than an archetype and more than the apostle of the apostles, as she is sometimes called. Rather, she was and still is an ambassador to God whom we can relate to, speak to, and learn from.\nIn this engaging, interactive, inspiring 11-part course, we’ll journey to discover who Mary Magdalene was, what role she plays in both the Christian story and in bringing wisdom that's relevant to any faith path, and what she has to teach us today. In short, we'll come to know Mary and hear her voice.\nDrawing on extensive meditations, detailed research and holding open questions over a three year period, author, spiritual teacher and interfaith minister Clive Johnson invites you to discover what is known, assumed and not known about Mary in a quest to enrich your own spiritual journey.",

      "description": "Hi there and welcome to Tarot 101!\n\n\nIn this course we'll cover everything you need to know to read the tarot cards. Each chapter is relatively short with simple explanations so that the information can be easily absorbed.\n\n\nBasic symbolism can take an inexperienced tarot card reader from absolute beginner to completely independent. Each chapter of the course explains the ideas behind the basic symbols in the cards by looking at numbers, colours, the elements and of course, the cards themselves. By understanding these you can focus on the fun part of reading tarot - learning from experience - rather than spending the beginning of your tarot journey sifting through guides and definitions and trying to figure out which is relevant to your reading.\n\n\nBy building a solid foundation in symbolism you have an easy starting point that you can build upon. All tarot readers are always learning from experience. Reading the cards is an art form. Over time you develop a personal language with the cards and with each reading your tarot vocabulary expands. Don't waste your time learning the wrong things and getting stuck, build a solid foundation from the beginning.\n\n\nWhat is covered in the course:\n\n\n1 - Getting Started: Helpful points to keep in mind before you even begin reading\n2 - What is The Tarot: History of the tarot and a description of how the cards are structured\n3 - Minor Arcana: Basics behind the minor arcana cards, the suits and their four elements\n4 - Numbers: Symbolism of numbers (numerology) + examples of how they work within each of the minor suits\n5 - Colours: Symbolism of colours and chakras\n6 - Court Card Basics: Basic structure and meanings behind the court cards\n7 - Court Card Characters: Meet and understand all the different characters that make up the court cards\n8 - Major Arcana Basics: Basic structure and meanings behind the major arcana\n9 - The Hero's Journey: Description of the Hero's Journey as the story unfolds through the major arcana cards\n10 - Major Arcana Meanings: A description of each of the major arcana cards and their meanings\n11 - Reading The Cards: Tricks to use for interpreting your cards\n12 - Spreads: Cover three useful card spreads and examples using everything we have learned in the course\n\n\nLet's have some fun & begin your tarot journey in the smartest, easiest way!",

The Master text explains that the intention of Kriya Yoga is to systematically attain the nadir of all Yogas - Kaivalya or Complete Liberation.\n\nAccording to the Second Chapter of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - Sadhana Pada, Kriya Yoga is the practised correctly when one combines tapas or heat increasing spiritual austerities with Svadhyaya (study of the self) and Ishvarapranidhana (depositing one's life force unto higher consciousness).\nWhen practised with the right view and the correct technique, the 21-Step powerful Kriya Yoga practice burns away our mento-emotional afflictions or cognitive fallacies, thus paving the way for Samadhi or Mergence with All. In this course, you would learn the 21-Step Kriya Yoga Technique that nips the root cause of all Cognitive Fallacies or Kleshas, and thus paving the for Higher Cognitive States of Samadhi.\n\nThis course is especially helpful for aspiring meditators and yoga practitioners who wish to fully understand the science behind the practice of Kriya Yoga techniques and how these techniques can help students achieve a beautiful mind and an open heart by reducing the cognitive fallacies or kleshas.\n\n\nSome of the Key Concepts Covered in the Video are -\n\na) What is Destiny? What is Personality? How can we move towards a clear mind, that thinks without any biases, and perceives nature as it is?\nb) What is the Source of All Pain? How can the same be Overcome?\n\nc) The Yogic interpretation of Ego and the various manifestations of this Ego that make up our unique personalities.",

The 12 theories dictate how magick works and functions in reality, and how you can utilize them to your advantage in your spellwork to craft effective magick rituals. They apply to both the workings of the mind and the world at large, deriving information from science and psychology to support the notion that magick is an effective tool for creating change in accordance with will.\nEach of the mechanics demonstrate an aspect of magick that when understood and practiced, can add energy, structure and effectiveness to any magick and spellwork.\nMechanics are defined as a branch of physical science that deals with energy and forces and their effect on things in the universe. This book presents mechanics of magick based on their consistency in practice across the majority of magickal systems of thought and their effectiveness in creating changes in one's reality.

But then we are all not yogis and actually have a life and the above mentioned time frame is sufficient to induce positive benefits.\n\nIn Module 2, I have taken help from a lot of studies done on meditation and how it affects our health. Make sure to go through this module, as literally knowing how this simple act of concentrating on your breathing can have a profound effect on your health.\n\nIn Module 3, I discuss various types of Meditations. In ancient spiritual texts, there have been mentions of over 1000 types of mediations, however in this course I discuss few common types of meditative practices which are widespread around the world.\n\nStarting with Vipassana Meditation, I discuss my 10-Day Experience at their retreat (All Vipassana retreats worldwide are 100% Free of Cost)\n\nI then discuss Zen Meditation, Loving-Kindness Meditation, Transcendental Meditation. I then introduce Yoga as a form of meditation and finish this module with The Four Noble Truths taught by Gautama The Buddha.\n\nModule 4 is where the rubber hits the road. Learning and empowering yourself about the benefits and types of meditation is very essential to at the very least motivate us and generate enough momentum to give this ancient healing art a sincere try.\n\nIf you already have been practicing meditation and have not been able to find continuous success, then gaining the information I discuss in the first 3 modules will most probably propel you to give this fabulous technique a sincere try again:)\n\nSo in Module 4, I break down on how a beginner can start meditating in 4 easy steps!\n\nYou will not only be learning about how to find the best place in your house to meditate, but also learn important pointers on how to achieve the most effective posture(s) to meditate i.e. The Best Butt Position, The Best Leg Positions, Shoulder, Head, Spine and Hand positions.\n\nModule 5 will provide you a 21-Day Meditation Challenge for Beginners/Advanced. This program has certain rules and guidelines and you'll be required to stick to them in order to get fabulous results.\n\nIn order to make the most of your Meditation Challenge, I have created many guided meditations. From observing your breath as a starting point to observing sensations all over your body to AUM Chanting, there are many guided meditation sessions that you will find very useful.\n\nI highly recommend that everyone who pursue this course, take up this 21-Day Challenge.\n\nModule 6 is your final exam and you need to score above 70% if you want your CPD Certificate.\nAll instructions on how to get your certificate is provided in this module.\nMay you Prosper\nMay you Heal\nMay you all be Blessed\n###IMPORTANT###\nWe offer a CPD Certificate which is different from the Udemy's Certificate of Completion.

      "description": "What is Spirituality? It is a beginners course for a true spiritual seeker who has lost in many confusions of today, as to what truly spirituality is about. It is explained here in simple ways what it involves to be a spiritual aspirant. With many simple tips, guidance, insights and meditations explained in this course, it  is  a great start for some one on a true spiritual path. Your coach will assist you and work with you along the way and support you throughout this journey.\nIn this course you will learn ......Spirituality is about discovering who we are in our life. Have you ever asked yourself these questions: “What is life all about? What am I doing here? Who am I deep within? What is my purpose in life? What has been going on so far in my life?”\nWhen you arrive at a stage of asking questions about where you are in your life rather than constantly chasing something—or repeatedly obsessing over something never taking a moment to see what is going on in and around you—you start awakening into a sacred life.\nRather than continuously pleasing your ever-present desire to want new things or experiences or living in confusion about your current life situation, you are looking to discover enlightenment.\nIf you have experienced severe pain, trauma, or grief and feel that life is full of suffering, or you no longer see happiness in your life, you have come to the point of discovering your inner peace.\nYou know you’ve found and connected to your true self when you begin looking at everything and questioning if that is what you truly want. You ask yourself, “What in my life will keep me happy, balanced, and purposeful?”\nSpirituality arises at a point in your life when you begin exploring your inner world, peace, to discover your purpose and fulfil the life you were born to live. If you are looking to embark on this journey I am looking forward to walking with you and will support you throughout this course.",

      "description": "Growing up as an African American 4th generation Christian, I was always wondered why a loving God would condone slavery in the bible. I never asked these questions of the people in my church because such questions were taboo. i have heard people ask this question of their christian leaders, and received a rebuke for asking in response.\nAs I grew older, atheist and black conscious individuals began to come up to me asking me \"how could you serve a God that condones slavery???\"... Or statements like \"You were only christian because the religion was forced on your ancestors during slavery\"... I was ashamed because, I grew to know the love of God and had a real relationship with him. Yet, I could not refute any of these sayings, I could not defend my reason for being a christian. I saw many of my friends leave the faith because of this reason, and that hurt even more. For this reason I had to find out the answer to these questions, for myself, so that I may have a reason for the hope that I place my faith in.  During this time of study, I became a Chaplain, Youth Leader, Missionary, Motivational Speaker, and Christian Author.\nIn my journey of spiritual maturity, I gained the answer to my question. I realized that, everything concerning God that we have questions about (which He desires to reveal to us) can be found through diligent, Holy Spirit inspired study, prayer and devotion.\nIf you are a christian that has had the same question, or an individual who is curious about God, or even an atheist who is just looking for another point of view to debate against........THIS COURSE IS FOR YOU!!!!!!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Character of God usually gets a bum wrap because many christians cannot lovingly defend the hope that they believe.\nThrough this course we provide 1 hours worth of 7 lectures that explain:\n1.Spritual Slavery In The Bible.\n2. Compare The System & Laws of Biblical Slavery with Antebellum Slavery\n3. Hebrew Slave System\n4. Non-Hebrew Slave System\n5. Was Christianity In Africa Before the Slave Trade?\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIF YOU HAVE EVER WONDERED ABOUT THIS QUESTIONS.... THIS COURSE IF FOR YOUR\nIF YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT GOD......THIS COURSE IF FOR YOU...\nIF YOU ARE AN ATHEIST LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW TO DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY AND THE  BIBLE..... THIS COURSE IS FOR YOU.\nALL ARE WELCOME FROM BEGINNERS TO THOSE MATURE IN THE FAITH & KNOWLEDGE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTAUGHT BY: Andrae B.

      "description": "Come learn from Master Clinical Hypnotherapist, Joseph Drumheller!\nOver 16,000 online students in 147 countries\n40+ online courses\nConducted 2,000+ private healing sessions\n4-time award-winning author\nWorked 6 years in cancer radiation clinic as a Clinical Hypnotherapist\nWelcome to Guided Meditations for Spiritual Awakening, Part 2. Due to the popularity of the first course in this series, Guided Meditations for Spiritual Awakening, I've decided to create a companion course to take you deeper into mystical experiences and divine connection.\nHowever, before we begin, let me warn you, this class will not be normal. We'll be stepping outside of the meditation box to touch on topics that have enormously accelerated the spiritual growth of myself, my clients, and thousands of others. I've experienced everything in this course first-hand and can vouch for the validity. So buckle your seat belt, as we bring life into the surreal world of mysticism. This class will not be boring.\nIn this course, I'll provide lectures, contemplations, guided meditations, and exercises designed to expand and enhance your experience of spirituality. I've also thrown in a few true stories of awakening, to add a little entertainment. If that's not enough, I'm also going to challenge you to try some new things. I highly encourage you to give them a try.\nTopics will include:\nHow to recognize and AVOID DELUSION.\nHow to set PROTECTION.\nHow to FEEL and SENSE ENERGY.\nRecognizing and tapping into the reality of SPIRITUAL GUIDES, ANGELS, and ANIMAL TOTEMS.\nAn introduction to SACRED GEOMETRY.\nHow to connect to EARTH ENERGY and find YOUR SACRED PLACE.\nAn introduction to the ONENESS DEEKSHA.\nA VERIFICATION SHEET to chart your progress.\nAlthough there are no prerequisites for this course, I highly encourage you to check out the introductory course in this series, Guided Meditations for Spiritual Awakening. That course will help establish a strong foundation, so you can open up to deeper sacred mysteries in this course.\nOn a side note, this class is very near and dear to my heart because of all the miraculous events I've experienced, from what is laid out in this course. It's had a huge impact on my life and I'm very excited to share it with you. I hope it will do the same for you.\nWhat students are saying:\n…I wanted to tell you that I’ve taken a lot of online courses & yours are some of the best I’ve come across.… Lauren Carter\n…the meditations are next-level awesome. Courtney Seard\nThis course was delivered in a simple-to-follow fashion. I especially enjoyed the meditations and feel as though I really connected with and was able to truly feel a presence and full-body energy vibrations from each of them. This is a huge plus for me! So many courses and meditations out there that you end up not really connecting with and you leave feeling empty or dissatisfied. This was not the case with this course. If you are in the early stages of a spiritual journey that you give this a try. You need to be connected with yourself and in the right frame of mind and this course walks you through each stage clearly and with easy-to-follow exercises. So worth it! Kevin Dickens\nDrumheller asks me to go deep right off. He is gentle in his delivery, providing a safe space for me to resolve stuff I thought I had taken care of. I am looking forward to the rest of the course. Susy Goins\nExcellent clarification and just amazing. Wow!! Mollie Shannon Rama",

Aeons ago, Saami's were more widespread and even in southern Finland, still today we can find place names that have Saami origins. The stories that I share in this course, come from Lapland of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. There are several Saami languages, you will probably hear that different deities and spirits, have several different names because of this.

      "description": "This course presents an integrative and systematic approach to Eye-Gazing Meditation (EGM). The approach is simple, straightforward, and can be enjoyed by just about anyone!\n\nEye-Gazing Meditation is a uniquely interpersonal and relational approach to meditation that, very quickly, produces profound experiences of intimacy, connection, and insight for those who engage in it. Somehow it has gone largely unnoticed by both the general public, academic researchers and clinicians: I hope this course will change that!\n\nThe course takes the format of a 'Question & Answer' workshop and between each of the twenty videos is a quick learning activity that will help you to get the most from the course.\n\n\nThis approach to Eye-Gazing Meditation allows you to:\n· Create experiences of deep intimacy with your partner\n· Foster an authentic connection with your partner\n· Gain profound insights into the nature of Being\n· Heal relational traumas that block genuine intimacy\n\nThis course is most suitable for:\n1. Couples seeking to strengthen their relationship\n2. Those hoping to run group workshops and group therapy work\n3. Use as a therapeutic intervention in counselling and therapy work with couples and families\n4. Individuals who seek a deeper ontological understanding\n\n\nIt is also my hope that this approach to meditation (which is so focussed on creating a sense of connection) might have massive untapped potential when it comes to healing some of the divisions that we see emerging in our communities, societies and species as a whole.\nTo this end I invite you to join me in experimenting with this innovative approach to interpersonal healing so that you can not only enjoy more intimate and meaningful connections in your own life but share this powerful meditation system with people in your life and your community.\n\nBy the end of this course you'll be able to approach Eye-Gazing Meditation with confidence, help others couples to discover the benefits of the practice, and have sufficient knowledge to run your own Eye-Gazing Meditation workshops.",

Psychometry is an ancient skill used by our ancestors as they connected with nature. Reading objects gives credibility to the Psychic arts and is akin to reading people or cards. Working with objects, crystals, photographs, plants, trees and flowers is an exciting and fun ability to develop. Being able to determine the properties of the natural world is a wonderful ability to have.\nIn this course you will learn about the history of Psychometry, some of the theories of how it is possible, how to prepare for a reading, psychic abilities used in Psychometry and some practical meditation exercises to develop your skills. A course notes booklet is provided with some basic instructions and pages to make notes and keep track of your readings.\nI will also demonstrate for you with objects, photographs, books and jewellery, a Flowermancy reading (Victorian art of reading messages from flowers) and psychometry with my very own kitten!\nPsychometry is a fundamental method for healing and guidance and is a valuable tool in your intuitive development and your practice as a Psychic and Medium.",

      "description": "As per WHO biggest problem of the 21st century is STRESS . Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds. Modern Man has learned to control big machines but failed miserably to control his own Mind.\n\n\nOur scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.\n\n\nFamous actor Jim Carrey says - I wish everyone could get rich and famous and everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that's not the answer.” You can chase followers & money all you want (don't let me stop you) but I hope you'll realize beyond your basic needs they won't do much.\n\n\nUnderstanding life’s deeper meaning is especially important in today’s times because we have so many options to choose from. Just as it’s possible to spend a whole day surfing superficially on the net looking at this picture or that movie or that news without learning anything worthwhile or even enjoying anything substantially, so too can we spend our whole life surfing superficially, doing this and that, without ever connecting with our essence, without understanding what it is that makes us us, without manifesting that which we are meant to contribute during our life-journey.\nThe importance of meaning in life is highlighted by classic books such as Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankly. Based on the author’s survival amidst the horrors of the Holocaust, it explains how without a purpose for life, we lose the drive to live. A lack of a sense of overall meaning and purpose of life is the cause of the many mental health problems facing society nowadays ranging from depression to suicidal urges. They all have their specific, complex triggers, but they also originate in a universal malaise: the alienation and disorientation coming from meaninglessness and purposelessness.\n\n\nPsychologist William Sheldon of Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons echoes, “Deeper and more fundamental than sexuality, deeper than the craving for social power, deeper even than the desire for possessions, there is a still more generalized and universal craving in the human makeup. It is the craving for knowledge of the right direction—for orientation.”",

In what directions?\nWhat Ingredients to be used to Light lamps?\nWhat time the lamps should be lite?\nHow many lamps can we light?\nWhat type of lamp to be used?\nWhat lamp should we light for various problems?\n\n\nIn my life, The lighting of lamps though it can appear to be very simple has helped a lot in solving multiple issues. I first thought lamp lighting was a simple thing.  But one day, when i was at my early 30s I was facing a lot of family issues. On that day my aunt came to visit me. And suddenly there was a argument at my house. She was terrified if this would cause some family problems. Suddenly she ran to the nearby temple and lite a lamp. The entire problem became smooth in a few minutes. That is when I started getting more aware of how lighting a lamp can solve a issues.\nThis art then started off to get more and more deeper to the point where I used to light almost 20 to 30 lamps of a daily basis. Till date this has been one of my favorite ritual to solve any life problem.\nIn this course you can also apply whatever thought to make your life much smoother, healthier and happier!",

This is a very special kind of astrology that was developed to specifically address those questions that many, if not all people have:\nIn which occupations and areas of life will I most likely achieve success and prominence?\nWhich partner is the most appropriate for me?\nWhen am I going to be lucky?\nCan we do business together?\nWhat's the best time to meet a partner?\nWhen should I start my project?\nMagi Astrology is special because the answers it offers are specific. It's not a vague, uncertain kind of advice you can often get in some other schools of astrology. To make this approach possible, Magi Society, which is the organization behind the Magi Astrology, did a lot of research, and they presented their findings over the years in three books and many online articles.\nI am using Magi Astrology for more than two decades, and in this course I was able to concentrate, systematize and present in the most comprehensible way knowledge from many different sources. I will teach you everything that is necessary to understand and start practicing Magi Astrology. For those who have no previous knowledge of serious astrology, I will offer an introductory module explaining thoroughly all the necessary details. And if at any point you'll feel like you are lost, just reach out and I'll help you. I might even add a few more lessons to make a problematic concept easier to understand.",

      "description": "All of us struggle with something. Paul captures this idea well in Romans 7.\n\n“It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.”\nTry as we might, we still stumble and fall, and the struggle against pornography is about as difficult of a battle as a man will face.\n\n\nBro, I WISH I could say that taking an online course will remove that struggle… But I can’t. If the Apostle Paul, who was writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit continued to struggle against sin, we will too.\n\nBut here’s what I can promise you.\nGod wants you to pursue Him in spite of your battle with pornography.\nJust because we are going to struggle, doesn’t mean we can give up. Paul also says in Romans, that because of God’s Spirit in us\n“you have no obligation whatsoever to do what your sinful nature urges you to do.”\n\n\nHe wants us to band together as Christian brothers, making a commitment to fight along side one another. That’s exactly what this course is designed to do – To give you a platform for fighting against the struggle with pornography. I believe you will benefit from this course. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have created it. Opting in to a community of men who are as tired as you are of drowning in their addiction is a great place to start.\nSo I invite you to join us.\nWhether pornography is an addiction or just a temptation, you are welcome here. We keep everything confidential. So take that first step and give yourself a fighting chance to break the chains of sin that are holding you back.\nEnroll in the course today!\nI’ll see you there.

      "description": "We all have an Aura that consists of many layers. When the energy in our Aura is clear, it is easier to live a bright life in tune with our mission. A bright Aura allows our soul to integrate into our physical body completely. Our Aura contains information, stories, experiences, emotions, and thoughts; sometimes, dense energies lower our vibration. Quantum aims to clear these energies and raise the frequency of our energy-body. This clearing is done from a Quantum Healing perspective. Our Aura is also a boundary, and Quantum Energy Clearing can remove obstacles in our energy field, which makes it easier to become aware of our boundaries.\nQuantum Energy Clearing sessions can be done as a separate modality. It can also be integrated into a Quantum Healing session.\nIn this course, you will learn how to do this as a solitary working individual or to use this technique as a team.\nMy experiences with Quantum Healing and Remote Spirit release inspired me to create this course. The Quantum theories suggest that we influence our reality by our perspective. This is why I created this course: to do energy clearings using a positive and loving perspective. We all come from the Light, and the energies lacking light can be returned to the light. This course teaches you how your Spirit Guides can do this.\nThis course will be updated with more practice session recordings.\nOf course, the information in this course is a spiritual perspective, not a medical one.",

      "description": "The concept of spiritual alchemy came from Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, that studied many different religious, sacred, and mythic texts in order to understand the psychology of humanity. Jung describes the steps of transformation in relation to the process of analysis in his professional paper titled Problems of Modern Psychotherapy.\nSpiritual Alchemy is spiritual transformation. In this course we will discuss the seven stages of alchemy or transformation, how to identify each stage, what is involved, and different methods to work through the alchemist transformation. While physical alchemy is concerned with altering and transforming the properties within matter, spiritual alchemy is concerned with freeing your spiritual self which is trapped within you by the unrefined parts of yourself such as your fears, personal beliefs,  or self-loathing.\nSymbolically, we cannot turn lead into gold if your soul and psyche are not in tuned with the material process. The psyche of the mind must be in line with the spiritual alchemy process which is the integration of the Shadow unto one’s Self. Perhaps there are issues within our character, our interests, our career, our family, other relationships, and even trauma from our childhood, where we have not yet faced. While going through this transformation, we continue through each of the seven stages, digging deep within ourselves to find healing, releasing, self-love, and ultimately, a spiritual awakening.\nThe greatest achievement of the alchemist process is to heal the relationship between our mind and matter.",

You will also find lectures dedicated to Ignatius' popular & still relevant prayer forms: the Spiritual Exercises, the Examen of Consciousness & his particular prayer, the Sucipe'. Also, we will take a look at the role and importance of friendship on his journey. There will be a reflection activity in each section for you to apply what you learn to enhance your spirituality.\nLearning Objectives:\nYou will be able to retell the story of Ignatius of Loyola, recounting his growth from spiritual childhood to spiritual maturity.\nYou will be able to recount the important mystical moments that continued to redirect Ignatius' life.\nYou will learn about the culture of 16th century Spain and the role the Catholic Church which was the focus of Ignatius' spiritual vocation.\nYou will explore the important role of women in St. Ignatius' life, how they contributed to his mission of service to others.\nThrough the reflections in this course on the various points in Ignatius' life, you will be able to apply his spiritual acumen to your own life for spiritual enrichment.",

Definitely, Covid-19 bought the focus on the mortality of every man and the fine line many people thread between life and death. All of these occasions and events have a way of creating a thirst for God\nOne aspect of this supernatural reflection and fascination is the angelic created beings. Even though angels are sometimes falsely depicted  – like the many images of female angels – the desire to know more has not weaned.\nHowever, there is one thing to thirst for knowledge and another to desire the truth according to the word of God. Therefore, in this study we want to answer the following questions:\n· Who are angels of God?\n· How many angels does God have?\n· How were angels described in the Bible?\n· Who is the first angel of God?\n· What are the 7 fallen angels?\n· Who sits at the left hand of God?\n· Are there only 12 demons?\n· What’s the meaning of demons?\n· Who is the king of demons?\n· What are inner demons?\n· What language do demons speak?\n· Who is the Queen of demons?\nAnd many more!\nJoin me in this study as we unravel the truth about angels, demons and what the Bible actually says.\nThis course will be continuously updated as I discover other insights about the subject, hence I employ you to return to it again and again.\nSo lets get started!",

      "description": "Many new students of A Course in Miracles have been enrolling in my  \"A Course In Miracles, intensive\" which is not intended for beginners. I woke inspired this morning to begin the lessons in a much more brief and to the point way just for them. As it has been a few years since the development of the Intensive course, I hope to make my assistance far less intimidating while still touching some deep concepts and necessary steps in the awakening endeavor.\nWelcome to the A Course in Miracles Experience.\nThis part of the twelve focuses on Lessons 31-60\n--------\nDid you know: All of our courses are unscripted. Each course in the series is so similar because they are recorded back to back. This is an entirely spiritually-guided experience.\n--------\n\n\nIntroduction to \"A Course in Miracles\"\n“This is a course in miracles. It is a required (inevitable) course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you may elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s Presence, Which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.\nThis course can, therefore, be summed up very simply in this way:\nNothing real can be threatened.\nNothing unreal exists.\nHerein lies the Peace of God.“\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" is a self-study course designed to enhance your personal relationship and perspective of the divine, naturally bringing about personal revelation and first-hand experience beyond the veil of death.\nThis intended year-long, daily practice gives you a multitude of formats to fully embrace what this course has to offer. While this is an unusual setting for such a course, the journey in which we embark is within. Not within a church, a temple on some mountaintop with a guru or even us, but this journey is within you.\nThe main essence of this course uses “Christian” terminology, however, most mainstream religions claiming the name of christ do not claim this to be from the same source. However, this course does not intend on spreading the worship of any dogmas or blind-faiths (which are beautiful in their own right) but the offering of actual first-hand experience of \"christ\" and \"God\" (by any definition) and find out the Truth for yourself.\n\n\n------\n\n\nAll textual quotes from \"A Course in Miracles\" are copyrighted ©1992, 1999, 2007 by the \"Foundation for Inner Peace\", 448 Ignacio Blvd., #306, Novato, CA 94949, www acim org and info @ acim org, used with permission, and acknowledged here out of respect.\nHowever, All quotes are extracted from William Thedford's \"Hugh Lynn Cayce draft\" version which Judge Robert Sweet of the Southern District of New York ruled on October 24, 2003, that its original copyright is invalid and therefore forever in Public Domain.\nA note to ponder: All valid copyrights were made long after the author and co-author were deceased.",

I teach you using some of the same information that I give to my private students who want to learn the Yuen Method. Just keep in mind that you will be shifting and improving while you are watching. All you have to do to complete the short but packed with information course, and use it!\nStudents of the Yuen Method often are overly concerned with the midline and believe that the midline is the key to success with the Yuen Method, but it is not. There are principles of the Yuen Method that, if followed and applied, can help you to shift any issues you or your clients may be having. This course focuses on these principles.\nAs an instructor, I see students self sabotaging themselves thinking they need to practice or study or learn the yuen method. Instead,think of Yuen Method as an attunement and think of the principles that I teach in this course as ways to shift the energy without having to go into a specific root cause. We can shift in a general way and be quicker.  Although my courses do not go on sale, the prices still are the best prices for  Yuen Method courses globally.\nIf this interests you and if you are ready to be open minded and understand that while I am talking, you are shifting... then this course will truly benefit you.  I only ask that you value this and that you try to shift those around you so,we can all together, improve the world.",

While Buddhism is by definition a religion, in actual practice it resembles philosophy and psychology more than religion if we go by Buddha's actual teachings.\nBuddhism is essentially a set of tools developed over thousands of years in India, China, Japan and throughout Asia. These tools are more applicable now than ever before as we grapple with the anxiety that has become typical in modern life.\nThis course will introduce to you what Buddhism is, how it can help you develop happiness, contentment, equanimity, peace, and love so that you can deal with modern challenges effectively, and generally enrich your experience as a human being.\nI have now spent thousands of hours studying Buddhism, meditating, and speaking with monks at Pagodas and Monasteries throughout Vietnam and South East Asia. Since I am an American, I feel that I am in a unique position to communicate the essence of Buddhism and it's teachings to a western audience as very few people can.\nIn addition, I am trained as a teacher, with a teaching certificate from the University of Idaho as well as a master's degree in curriculum and instruction from the same school. So I am confident that students will leave my course with a solid understanding not only of what Buddhism is, but HOW it can help you to improve yourself and change your life for the better.\nJoin my course, and let these ancient strategies help you deal with modern challenges.

You can think of it as a channel of information coming in and through you to serve you and others for the highest good.\nI'm going to show you how easy it is to connect with your Soul's Language in this Course. Step by step, you will learn about what Light Language is, what it can be used for, and how to use it. We will tap into our childlike essence to play in the energetic playground of light as you open up to your Soul. Your language will begin to flow with ease.\nBy the end of the course, you will be activated and ready to speak and sing your Light Language. You may even begin to share your light language with the world, aligning more into your path and potential, and healing others with your new connection to your Soul's Language. Are you Ready?",

      "description": "In the profound journey of the disciples with Jesus, they transcended the confines of the temple's four walls and gained a profound understanding of what it truly meant to share the message of the Kingdom. Beyond the confines of Sunday morning services and evangelism projects, the Descent to Compassion Course beckons us to venture into the highways and hedges, where life unfolds uninterrupted by the constraints of a 30-minute sermon. Here, we align ourselves with the path that Jesus treads daily, inviting His people to actively participate in His ongoing work.\nThis course isn't just about the extraordinary; it's about recognizing the divine moments that unfold in the ordinary rhythms of our daily lives, for God is continually at work. Each day presents an opportunity to witness His presence, provided we open our eyes and hearts to perceive, rather than blindly walking away. By immersing ourselves in these encounters with the divine, our lives acquire newfound significance. Embracing a compassionate lifestyle redirects our focus from self-centeredness to others, unveiling the good works preordained for us. Guided by the hand of the Lord, we embark on a journey to unearth these works and live a life of purpose and impact. Blessings.",

      "description": "What if I told you that there was a simple, quick technique to make your magic more secure and effective while also increasing your spiritual authority?\nThe Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram also called the LBRP, is a ceremonial magic ritual that was developed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This ritual can be used by witches and other magic practitioners to get in touch with their own divinity and to clear their spaces of unwanted energies. In this course, we will teach you how to get the most out of this ritual.\nYou do not have to belong to any magical order to learn this ritual. This course goes deeper into the LBRP than most organizations ever will .\nThe LBRP is a very powerful ritual that can be used for many purposes. Here are some of the things that you can use the LBRP for:\n- Emptying your home and other spaces of negative energies, spirits, and beings\n- Getting in touch with your divine self and establishing spiritual sovereignty.\n- Connecting with the astral realm while building focus and strengthening the magical will\n- Increasing the safety and effectiveness of your spells and rituals\nThe LBRP is so effective, that many magical organizations require their initiates to perform it several times a day.\nThe majority of LBRP instructions are vague or incomplete, but this training gives you everything you need.\nWhen I first learned the LBRP I found a lot of the instructions highly confusing. Go to Reddit or any other sites where people discuss magic and you'll see how confused people are.\nYou may find printed instructions on the web, as well as videos of other people performing the ritual on Youtube. What none of these show you is what's going on astrally during the ceremony - that's the most important part!\nThe ritual itself is deceptively simple and can be described in under 100 words. However, these descriptions and directions lack important elements that make the ritual much more powerful.\nThis course goes beyond the mechanics and teaches you the purpose of each element. You'll learn how to vibrate names of power, and to deeply connect with the archangelic power.\nI'll even give you tips on memorization to help you internalize this ritual.\nThis course is for anyone who wants to:\n- Master the LBRP so that they can use it for its many purposes\n- Learn about the history and uses of the LBRP\n- Improve their magical practice by adding this powerful ritual to their arsenal.\n- Learn a practical tool for psychic and spiritual self-defense\nSo, if you're ready to learn this critical ritual and tap into the boundless well of spiritual power - sign up today!",

This course starts by exploring Intrusive Energy, what it is and how it can affect us as may people come into contact with energies that may influence and affect their energy system in negative or unhelpful ways. With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to study some wonderful easy techniques that can be used to remove Intrusive Energies from both people and places. You can create these for yourself with minimal fuss and cost, trying mostly to use product that you may already have available to you in your home.\n\n\nProtection is so important. This still seems to be an area that people are not paying enough attention to. You will have the opportunity to reevaluate your protection, learn a wonderful 'Aura Strengthening' technique and have the wonderful chance to explore four different forms of protection through guided meditation. You will then be able to ascertain what you will include in your protection regime going forward, with the understanding that the more time and effort you attribute to your own protection, the better you will feel, and the healthier and more well balanced your energy will be.\n\n\nThis course further offers you the opportunity to create your own protective trinket or charm, something that you may choose to wear or keep close to offer an external layer of energetic protection. This is followed by a deep dive into how to go about protecting your space, and what I lovingly call Intruder Excluders. Intruder Excluders are items that we set up to repel unwanted or uninvited people from seeing, locating or damaging our home.",

      "description": "*******Over 5,000  students are enrolled in this course*******\nPondering, reflecting, contemplating on the nature of our personality, soul, and spirit is one of the most important aspects of traditional Yoga. Please don't overlook this essential part of your Yoga practices. This course will lead you through the levels of contemplation, from the basics to the most advanced contemplations as practiced by the ancient sages.\nYoga is a whole life process. The Contemplation of Jnana Yoga is one of the most advanced practices of Yoga. The reflective process of contemplation utilizes the word-forming habit of the mind in a directed way, so as to transcend not only body and breath, but most importantly, to go beyond the mind to the realization in direct experience the True Self, the Atman, or Center of Consciousness.\nA Suggestion: Our descriptions of traditional Yoga tend to be thorough, broad, and deep. This can lead you to think this is complicated, and that it's going to take a great deal of study like in a college class. But the suggestion is to take it easy; watch the presentations leisurely, like you might watch a movie while sitting on a comfortable chair or couch. Just absorb it, take it in. Don't worry about memorizing. It will gently sink in, and you can practice the principles in daily life. Go back later and look again at the presentations, whether all of them or a few. Terminology, principles, and practices will gently become familiar.\nThis course first outlines the preparatory practices, leading one to start the process of contemplation. The course then guides you in the preliminary practices of contemplation through the processes of positive inquiry of Internal Dialogue. Finally, you will be taught the traditional contemplations, the \"great\" contemplations known as Mahavakyas, which have traditionally be practiced primarily by those monks living lives of renunciation in remote places like the cave monasteries of the high Himalayas.",

Of my many conversations, I understood those five (six) mistakes we would clear up in the course here.\nThis course is meant for all audiences, the believer as those who don't, no matter what religion you hold today; YOU will find here a primary key for learning new thoughts and emotions kept secret by the old Hebrew Nation.\nI trust the material and the dialogue with other students will be encouraging and enlightening.\nBy taking this course, you will increase your understanding and knowledge of God's Word and have a firm foundation upon which to build your life.

      "description": "Have you ever tried to pray for a half hour? Perhaps you came to God with a list of requests and burdens on your heart? You were determined to pray through it, and you prayed ever-so earnestly only to look up at the clock: That was only three minutes!\nPrayer is an essential discipline in the Christian life, but many Christians hardly seek the Lord in prayer. How bad is the problem? According to surveys I have conducted in different evangelical churches, roughly 3/4 of regular attenders shared that they pray only a few minutes each day. This lack of prayer suggests that much of our strength for life and ministry isn't coming from above.\nI did not develop this course as an expert on prayer. Times of my own life and ministry have been relatively prayer-less. This course is the fruit of my own struggles to pray, and I hope it will help you grow more dependent upon the Lord.  Rather than praying because you must, learn to pray because you love to do so. Delight in seeking our Father in prayer.\nThe Lord is eager to hear His children pray. I hope you will sign up for this course and grow in your desire to seek Him!",

The greatest revelation that you can get out of the Bible about the devil is that he always being dealt with, defeated, and cast out. The Bible does not specify that there is a deliverance ministry as such; the devil is simply to be dealt with by casting him out when he rears his head. He gets most of his power from people who are tempted, lied to, and deceived. He has been a murderer and a liar and has been inspiring sin from the beginning. Jesus came into the world to undo all the works of the devil, which is the sin issue. We overcome the devil by understanding our full redemption through the cross. The devil cannot enter the heavenly realm but operates in a breathable atmosphere. The devil is not Lucifer, was not a worship leader in heaven, or an ex-archangel. Satan was a created being in the order of the animal world. In order for man to stand in righteousness there had to be something wicked so that man could utilize his free choice and say to a tempting enemy “no, I have all authority over you” just as Jesus did when He was tempted in the desert.",

Unlike many other twin flame teachings, this course was created by someone in twin flame union for over a decade.\n\n\nThe twin flame journey is a topic that causes a lot of confusion. Too many twin flame teachers are not in union with their own twin, and therefore can only guide people to a point. Typically, they are missing some key element of the process themselves.\nMost of the information online is incomplete or mixed up with other types of soul connections. It can be difficult to discern a clear direction if you are feeling stuck in this area of your life.\n\n\nIn this course, I give you the quick and dirty truth about what this path is really about, how to know if someone is your twin flame or not, and exercises and meditations to get you closer to your own harmonious twin flame union.",

      "description": "The magnetic pull of the moon is so powerful that it draws in the oceans towards the land, which causes the tides.\nOur bodies are mostly made up of water, so the moon also has a powerful effect on us.\nOur emotions are energy in motion - 'E-Motion', so as the moon waxes and wanes, so does the energy in our body ebb and flow, effecting our emotions.\nThis is why so many crazy things happen under the influence of a full moon, when the moon is at its full strength.\nThe effectiveness of magic is determined by how much energy you are able to wield, which is essentially emotional energy.\nTherefore, the moon can be a powerful ally when working with magic and manifestation.\nThe truth is that we have been cut off from the moon, by removing the 13 moon calendar and replacing it with the orderly 12 month Gregorian calendar, which ignores the lunar cycles, and creates artificial months instead.\nThe reason for this is that the powers that be understand the power that the moon gives us, especially women who are naturally attuned to the moon, due to their menstrual cycle.\nTherefore, they created artificial time which divorces us from the moon, and natural time and plugs us into the matrix of the control system, which runs our society in a clockwork fashion, much like a machine.\nThis puts into a mechanistic worldview, which is good for creating slaves to the system, much like robots.\nIn order to reclaim your power and Sovereignty, it is essential that you reconnect the wisdom of the Moon, and Nature's cycles.\nWe are blessed to have our lunar companion with us on our journey of life on planet Earth.\nThe moon rises and falls each night, always in flux, always available as a beacon of shining light who amplifies our ability to dance with the true luminous living energy matrix of reality.\nTaking this course, is a journey back to the natural rhythms of the moon, as it waxes so does our ability to create our reality amplify, through the laws of attraction, and our power to manifest.\nAs the moon wanes, so can we increase our power to remove thoughts, feelings, patterns of behaviour, people and even circumstances from our life.\nWorking with the moon will bring your life back into balance, as you harmonise with the natural cycles of the body, and the cosmos, as above, so below.\nLearn the secret of all secrets, the lost art of Sacred Secretion, which makes the illumination of your mind possible, every time that the moon is in your Sun Sign.\nAlso learn the role that the moon plays in the highest form of Magic there is, Alchemy, and how you can use the moon to achieve lasting Enlightenment.\nJoin forces with the most powerful attractor, awakening and healing force in our orbit, the moon, and manifest your dreams into reality right now...\nEnrol Now!",

      "description": "The Pleiadian Crystal Healing System is a system that was channeled directly from the 10D Pleiadian Council in 2021. The Pleiadians use crystals in almost all of their healing practices, as well transportation equipment. Crystals are a fundamental part of Pleiadian, and because there are currently 70 million Pleiadian Starseeds globally, there are now many humans that resonate deeply with crystals.\nUnlike Traditional Reiki, which was mainly designed to be used for hands on chakra healing, Pleiadian Crystal Reiki designed to heal both the chakras, as well as greatly magnify your communication with your spirit guides.\nThese frequencies, when channeled can be charged into a quartz crystal that can be worn/held by the client or charged into the crystals that match each respective Pleiadian Crystal Healing frequency.\n\n\nList of frequencies included with this course\nAmethyst + Lemurian Crystal Frequency\nLabradorite Frequency\nTurquoise Frequency\nOcean Jasper Frequency\nCitrine Frequency\nTigers Eye Frequency\nSmoky Quartz Frequency\nAll of these frequencies can be used individually, but when combined together in a grid or piece of jewelry such as a bracelet, they can create a very powerful amplification and vortex that increases the psychic power of the client. The messages from Source will be much clearer, concise and powerful.\nCrystals act as amplifiers for healings & activations. An analogy would be how a prism takes sunlight and then turns white sunlight into a rainbow spectrum. In this same way, a crystal takes the healing energy & intention behind it, and then adds layers of additional healing ability.\nThe Pleiadians brought crystal healing to Earth many eons ago. The Pleiades are a large group of suns & planets that have a gigantic variety of crystal materials that are used in both healing & space shuttle construction.\nCrystals are truly multidimensional beings that take energy and allow the bending of that across time, space & dimension. In the same way an electron or spacecraft can perform incomprehensible movements through space through dimension skipping, crystals access & add multidimensional frequencies to the original healing energy.",

It is not designed to make us experts in the twenty seven books it contains, but rather to provide a foundation from which we can engage in further, more detailed study of them.\nThe class will be divided into three major sections. In the first, we will look at the context of the New Testament. It is set within the Roman culture of the first century and its documents were produced by citizens of that culture. For us to truly understand what God is communicating to us through the pages of the New Testament, we must first understand what he was communicating to them.\nThe second section will examine the New Testament documents themselves; not from the perspective of what they say, but rather from the perspective of what they are, how they were produced and transmitted to us, and how we can be sure that they are reliable.\nFinally, we will look briefly at the content of the books of the New Testament recognizing that a thorough study of them is well beyond the intent of this class. We will look at them as groups of writings that contain many literary similarities. We will pay close attention to their genres as a key to understanding the intent of the author, and thus, the meaning for us.",

Each of these submissions can be found as downloadable files in various lectures.\nThe final sections are the symbols and how to use them,  including the entire attunement process.  Again,  this is for your benefit  of being more comfortable,  successful and at ease with passing attunements to others.\nMay you receive the brightest of blessings,\nChristopher",

      "description": "I am Kim Ora Rose, I am a Mary Magdalene High Priestess and I hold many different energies that I offer as initiations.  One of my signature energies is this beautiful Pink Bliss Divine Light.  This was a direct gift from Mary Magdalene which I receive when I visited her Cave in Provence in 2019.\nMary Magdalene often calls to people, you might hear her name and be interested, you might receive an oracle card reading and she comes up to remind you to tap into your own Self Love.  This course will initiate you to your own Bliss energy, to feel your own peace, you can channel this light for yourself or as a healing modality.  Once you are initiated you can initiate others there is no need to be a Reiki Master to receive this energy but a desire to seek more love in your life.\n\n\nIf you are new to energy healing or have been initiated to reiki or angelic reiki or other reiki’s you will feel how this is different in its vibration, is pure and comes from the Divine Feminine. When you use the energy it will build more and more over time within you.\n\n\nI received this initiation directly from Mary Magdalene when I visited her holy cave at Sainte Baume, this is a cave in Provence. I visited there on 21st June 2019 as part of a Magdalene Pilgrimage. I may have been attuned to this energy in a past life for I know I lived alongside Magdalene and Jesus and was part of the very early church. When Mary was spreading the Way of Love, in those early years and after the crucifixion.\n\n\nJoin me with my love of Mary Magdalene, she is my sister and constant guide, she brings in her healing energies, through roses, rays, flames and I hold many different frequencies of energy connected to her.  She moved to the South of France after the crucifixion and lived out her life with her sister Martha, her children and friends in Europe.  There are many places to visit in France connected to her and she brings love and blessings to whoever connects with her.\n\n\nThis energy comes as Pink Bliss energy it’s not a ray or flame as I have received before, it is an initiation of the Heart and Higher Heart Centre, it is an expansion of the Heart and flows from the heart. Often the Heart Centre is felt in green or pink colours and rose quartz crystals blend so well with this energy. It is a very high vibrational energy that fills you will Bliss energy.\n\n\nBliss is calming, peaceful, gentle but very powerful, it embodies the energy from Mary Magdalene herself and she brings this energy to you too.  Bliss brings love and compassion, understanding and nurturing of yourself and others, it is light and fills your aura and chakras with a sense of serenity.\n\n\nBliss is the Soul at peace,\nit is a happiness that flows over you\nMoment by Moment\nDivine Light\n\n\nKim Ora Rose\nMagdalene High Priestess\nAuthor, Oracle, Healer, Sister",

      "description": "A life of genuine wholeness and fulfillment can often seem too good to be true. Spirituality, religion, and self help have come up short so many times. But, isn't there still a cry in our hearts for real heavenly life? This course aims to re-look at the primary message of Jesus Christ as an authentic answer to the quest for life and peace. Through twelve sessions of Christ centered exploration a foundation is laid for sustainable heaven on earth bliss!\nDive Deep Into A Naturally Supernatural Life of Heaven on Earth\nIn Depth Identity-Based Discipleship Class Sessions w/ Matt Spinks\nOptional Homework Assignments and Accompanying Scriptures for Each Session\nAll Sessions are Presence Focused yet Include Practical Tips for Glory Life\nExperience True Discipleship from a Joy and Bliss Based Curriculum\nJesus Christ himself taught his disciples many beautiful and powerful truths. He told them to pass these along to others. Yet, the reality of becoming a Christ disciple has often been portrayed as a boring, manipulative, unattractive process. This is not how it was intended! Jesus is an ecstatically happy, spontaneous, passionate being! And, He spoke of His yoke as being easy, and his burden light. Being who you are in Christ is the most natural, effortless, and ecstatic experience ever to be. Discovering this Way of life as a real part of your long term awareness will bear incredible fruit!\nMany discipleship programs or Bible schools will discourage you, albeit unintentionally, by locking you into self-efforts, or a non-inclusive, judgmental mentality. There have been many distractions from the ecstasy of living as a genuine new creation in Christ. The Glory Foundations Class curriculum, with Matt Spinks, is a simple easy to understand collection of powerful pointers unto a whole new world. It is dripping with the life and authenticity of Papa, Jesus, and Holy Spirit, and may just be the catalyst you are looking for to live daily in heaven on earth!\nContents and Overview\nThis course contains 12 specifically developed classes and more than 15 hours of raw content. It's designed for anyone, regardless of experience level, who wishes to re-visit the foundations of a life of naturally supernatural Christ life.\nIn this course, you will be reminded in each session of your wholeness in Jesus Christ, and how that wholeness can manifest practically into a life that experiences heaven on earth.\nIt includes discussion regarding frequently asked questions, seeming pitfalls and misunderstandings, as well as practical down to earth tips.\nAnd, finally, you'll learn how to literally express the life of Jesus through your life, by the Love of the Father, in the power and Glory of the Holy Spirit .\nBy the end of this course, you'll be given a wide spectrum and variety of revelatory insights into reality, as well as tips on how to apply them joyously and effortlessly in real life. You will feel empowered in key areas so that you will confidently know that the God life has always been yours. You will be experiencing this life. You will see the fountains of living water flowing out of your innermost being to refresh all things!\nWhat are the requirements?\nA willingness to learn and consider scandalous against the \"status-quo\" realities\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\n12 sessions and more than 15 hours of content!\nBy the end of this course you will have been exposed to the clear Gospel of Jesus Christ and His liberating power to live in heaven on earth.\nYou will have been given a clear picture of the Finished Work of Christ and a child-like, yet mature understanding of it's implications.\nYou will have been given practical tools to enjoy a happy marriage, family, occupation, callings, finance, community, and many other areas.\nYou will be more creative, ecstatic, and capable of thinking in a completely new way.\nWhat is the target audience?\nSpiritual seekers of all kinds\nPeople new to the Finished Work of Jesus Christ, the Glory, or Grace\nAnyone who wants to be encouraged or refreshed in their experience of life",

Maintaining balance and well-being has become more crucial than ever in the hustle and bustle of today's fast-paced and stress-laden world. The Human Energy Field (HEF), comprising the Aura and Chakras, plays a pivotal role in our physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Understanding and harnessing this subtle energy system can bring profound healing and personal growth.\nIn this immersive program, students will delve deep into the intricate realms of energy healing, focusing on the pivotal foundation of Chakras and Auras. Understanding these fundamental energy centers is paramount as they serve as the cornerstone upon which ALL OTHER ENERGY HEALING MODALITIES REST.\nThis course has been meticulously designed to equip you with the foundational understanding of the Chakra and Aura energetic fields. This particular Master Practitioner Certification has been spread into three levels to capture the fundamental knowledge for both the beginner just learning about these incredible energy fields to the experienced practitioner seeking to expand their expertise and energetic modality toolbox.\nImportance of In-Depth Understanding:\n1. Foundation of Energy Flow: Chakras, the spinning wheels of energy aligned along the spine, and auras, the subtle energy fields surrounding the body, are the conduits through which life force energy flows. A profound comprehension of these energy centers is vital, as they dictate the overall health and vitality of an individual. Mastery of Chakras and Auras enables practitioners to identify blockages, imbalances, and disturbances within the energy system, allowing for precise and effective energy healing interventions.\n2. Holistic Approach to Healing: Chakra and Aura Healing forms the bedrock of holistic healing methodologies. By understanding the intricacies of these energy centers, practitioners can address physical ailments and mental, emotional, and spiritual imbalances. This comprehensive approach ensures that healing occurs at multiple levels, promoting lasting well-being and harmony.\n3. Diagnostic Proficiency: In-depth knowledge of Chakras and Auras empowers practitioners with diagnostic skills. By reading the energy patterns within these centers, practitioners can pinpoint the root causes of various issues. This diagnostic proficiency is invaluable, a guiding light for selecting appropriate healing techniques tailored to individual needs.\n4. Enhancing Other Modalities: Proficiency in Chakra and Aura Healing enriches and amplifies the efficacy of other energy healing modalities. Whether it's Reiki, crystal healing, sound therapy, or any other technique, a solid understanding of Chakras and Auras amplifies the impact of these practices. It provides practitioners with the wisdom to customize treatments, ensuring a synergistic blend of modalities for optimal results.\n5. Facilitating Spiritual Evolution: Chakras are deeply intertwined with spiritual growth and self-realization. A profound grasp of these energy centers allows practitioners to guide individuals on their spiritual journeys. By aligning and balancing Chakras and Auras, practitioners facilitate spiritual evolution, helping individuals connect with their higher selves and explore profound states of consciousness.\nFlexibility in Learning:\nRecognizing that each student's learning pace is unique, I have chosen to host this course on Udemy, accommodating various learning styles and time constraints.

      "description": "This course explores 18 selected psalms from the Psalter, the prayer book of the Bible and the early church. You will be encouraged and inspired by Israel's worship and praise of God as Creator. You will also come to sense how these ancient songs and prayers shaped the lives of God's people and sense the call of the Davidic kingdom that resounds throughout many of the psalms.\nThis course will examine themes of celebration, including praise for God's glory and his presence, as well as thanksgiving for his lovingkindness and faithfulness. It will also examine the lament of God's people for challenges they faced, losses and injustices suffered, and the hope they found in the middle of distress or disaster.\nThe 'articles' in the course include the biblical texts (New Revised Standard Version), for every lecture and 18 corresponding practice exercises. The practice exercises and discussion questions that accompany each lecture includes 8-10 questions or prompts that enable students to engage with the material to absorb, reflect, and practice what they are learning. There are no extra academic articles or required readings for this course.\nThe lectures in this course do not address textual issues, nor issues of authorship or when or how the Psalter was edited. Instead, each lecture will examine various types and themes within the psalms and probe the ways in which Israel viewed God, themselves, and the world.\nThese important psalms not only point Christians today towards worship in song or personal piety in practice, they also give voice and expression to concrete situations of international justice and global concerns for God to put the world to rights. The psalmist asks real questions such as:\nHow come the world is this way?\nHow do I pray for someone who feels the closure of death?\nWhat expressions can I use to praise the Lord and respond to the call to worship?\nWhere can I turn when everything seems hopeless?\nWhy does it seem like the wicked go unpunished?\nWhat words can I use to give thanks to God?\nHow can I celebrate with joy for all that God has done?\nWe invite you to join us as we explore these selections from the Psalms that continue to sing God's praise, build up the church, and give Christian voice that might resound throughout the world today.",

But if I go, I will send him to you (John 16:7).\nThat Counselor, or Advocate, is the Holy Spirit, who was sent by Jesus into this world at Pentecost in a new way to usher in a new age of spiritual transformation and service. Unfortunately, many people are relatively unfamiliar with the Person and ministry of the Holy Spirit. This course can help to provide a new and deeper appreciation for and openness to the Holy Spirit.\nA few of the topics we will cover include:\nWhat do we mean by “Spirit”?\nThe Holy Spirit and Original Blessing\nWounded Human Nature\nThe Holy Spirit and Conscience\nProphets and Promises\nJesus’ Teachings on the Holy Spirit\nThe Outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost\nThe Transformative Gifts of the Spirit\nCharismatic Gifts\nOpening to the Holy Spirit\nGrowing in the Holy Spirit\nFruits of the Spirit\nAnd much more\nOur learning process includes 15 videos (5 - 12 min.) with supplemental resources for each, including a PDF copy of Dr. St. Romain’s book, Jesus Alive in Our Lives. Reflection and discussion questions will be provided for individual and group use. Online questions and comments are also welcomed.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Holy Spirit and becoming more open to this great Gift of God's loving power and creativity, this course is for you.",

This knowledge then flows over into an understanding of the whole Bible and the finished work of Christ on the cross and the time leading up to the cross as well as the complete work after the cross. The Word explains the Word and the application of the Word is by the Spirit. Revelation cannot be studied separately from the rest of the WORD. Revelation started when Moses sang them a song of their destruction in Deuteronomy and then the prophets warned them about their end, and then Daniel revealed and sealed their end. Revelation is the complete work of Christ on the cross. Revelation reveals the final victory of the Christ that started on the cross and it deals with the final removal of the sacrificial system. The Pharisees and Sadducees sat in Moses’s seat and instead of celebrating the Christ, they crucified the Christ. All this happened in the fullness of time under Roman rule. We cannot change times and seasons or invent new Doctrines. We are to understand God’s eternal purposes worked out in time. 2Ti 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that need not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.",

This course has reaffirmed many of my beliefs and ideas about spirituality. I would recommend this to anyone, both a self-started and a advanced spiritual learner. The course is self-paced and provides many examples. It definitely helps how the instructor paces the lectures, they are not rushed. For me personally, the graphics and pictures have helped with meditating. The visualization meditation is also very straightforward, not demanding at all and designed for everyone with again specific focus to learn to forgive. It’s an amazing bonus to have a distant healing session included, usually these cost extra. The course is not demanding but covers a lot and yet not at all overwhelming. Not only do I recommend the course but also contacting the instructor for further reference to progress and work on the spiritual growth.\nIveta Lewis\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________",

      "description": "Who did Jesus think he was? What was the purpose of his ministry? And how do we know?\nThe Gospel of Luke situates itself as a work of serious history, using eyewitness testimony and oral tradition as its source material. It is the history of Jesus of Nazareth – a real, flesh and blood human – whose personal story is at the same time the story of God’s intention to put things right, for Israel and for the whole world. It is the story of a confrontation between the familiar empires of the world and God’s Kingdom, built on a new model of lordship; it is the story of a revolution of healing and feasting, rather than of violence.\nIn this course, Prof. Wright ushers students through Luke’s Gospel scene by scene, commenting and drawing out major themes and points of interest. He elucidates the narrative underpinning Luke’s accounts, untangling familiar parables, and dispelling well-worn misunderstandings along the way. Does Luke really depict a more human Jesus than other Gospels? What did Jesus mean by the age to come? This course focuses especially on Mary’s Magnificat as the beating heart which drives Luke’s portrayal of Jesus as Israel’s Messiah come to proclaim God’s visitation of judgement and mercy.\nIn this course, you will explore themes such as:\nJesus’s way of peace.\nJesus’s message of warning & welcome.\nThe Temple as a symbol of God’s heaven/earth reality.\nHow the powers of evil and darkness are defeated.\nThis course contains 43 video teaching sessions (15-20 minutes each), which you can watch or listen to online or on the Udemy mobile app. Also provided are optional quizzes to check your comprehension, Q&A sessions with Prof. Wright, and reflection prompts to help you apply the material. There are no extra academic articles or required readings.\nWe encourage students to proceed through this course at their own pace and consult the supplementary resources provided. Students possess lifetime access to course materials.\nCome join in the surprising story of God’s visitation and see why Prof. Wright calls Luke ‘the evangelist of prayer, praise, and peace’!",

Learn aspects of Quantum Touch and Pranic Healing and how to incorporate them into your current practice. You will also learn about sound healing, using guided imagery and regression therapy, and you will even learn how to see auras. Assuming that you've already learned about the aura and chakras, I've included only a session on the meridians with a little information on the nadis. As a bonus I've included a short course on chakra balancing, which is easy to learn and extremely effective.\nThe most effective technique in this course is Bhakti Regression. The healing results from this are phenomenal. People have healed years of pain, illness, unhealthy relationships, depression and anxiety by regressing into past lives, which have events that are the original core issue affecting them in this lifetime.\nAdvanced Bhakti Healing will improve and enhance the healing work that you are already doing. You will have more confidence in the effects of your work and have more guidance in your approach. Reiki is just the beginning. Incorporating these new techniques into your practice will help you to become the healer that you strive to be.",

For many years, I felt deeply connected to my feminine energy while suppressing the masculine within me. Over time, I learned to embrace both, allowing my masculine to rise in a healthy, balanced way—so I could fully express who I truly am. That integration was transformational, and it is the essence of what I now share with you in this course.\nAwaken Your Inner Warrior is about moving beyond conditioning and ego to live from your Soul essence. It’s a journey of shifting from Self to Soul—awakening to the truth of who you are. This program does not offer quick fixes or ready-made answers. Instead, it guides you to uncover your own inner wisdom, helping you find peace, strength, and deeper alignment with your authentic self.\nTogether, we will explore the conditioning and experiences that have shaped you, while working with masculine and feminine archetypes to expand your awareness. You’ll learn how to bring these energies into harmony, step into wholeness, and embody the higher self that already resides within you.\nAre you ready to awaken the warrior within and live as your most authentic self?

This course is made up of two parts - an introductory section that introduces all of the course elements and a series of Zoom classes conducted by Leoni Hodgson that will walk you through working with disease and psychological illness using the natal astrology chart.\n\n\nLeoni's work is a fusion of traditional astrology, esoteric astrology and eastern wisdom and takes a pioneering approach to working with and identifying illness and disease using astrology. This course provides an exciting opportunity for astrologers, energy workers and healers to extend the list of services they offer and to take a new look at illness in their work.\n\n\nA digital manual is included with this course and it covers the fundamentals of Leoni's work. But to truly get the most out of this course I strongly recommend purchasing her book and using it as companion content as you attend the Zoom classes.

And ultimately transform yourself to be the beacon that attracts success, wealth, happiness, meaningful relationships...\nALL of them.\nMost courses are 'surface level' or disrespect the spiritual process of learning.\nThis is why unlike most 'get spiritual quick' programs out there, I heavily emphasize on building a ritual or habit that you can follow everyday...\nSo you go from self-discovery to self-mastery and eventually to manifesting the things they truly desire in life.\nLearn the art of self-mastery so you will understand your true self and ignite your true potential in life\nLearn how to activate the power of the law of attraction and bend the universe to your will\nLearn how to activate your \"invisible shield\" that will protect you against countless negativity in life\nBe able to achieve crystal clear mental clarity and missile-like focus so you'll only manifest what truly matters.\nBe invincible in face of fear and able to face them hard on.\nBegin to notice that the right people, the right resources, the right relationships and the right circumstances just magically appear in your life without any prompting or effort from you\nLearn how to create your own legacy that is everlasting.\n... and many more profound wisdom waiting to be revealed.\nCan Anyone Do This?\nYES, ABSOLUTELY.\n\nThe idea of manifestation does not discriminate your age, profession, gender, current circumstances in life, religion, or creed.\n\nThe only criteria is having an open mind and willingness to try.\n\nThe principles and strategies take only 10 minutes a day (or less) to do - and after consistent practice, the manifestation of your desires becomes automatic.\n\nImagine how your life would be if you could manifest all your desires into existence:\n\nA loving relationship, an ideal job, perfect health, your dream house, a luxurious vacation, a brand new car - or anything you want - and it magically materialized in your life.\n\nWhen you combine the principle and strategies in Power Of Manifestation with your desire, you enter the realm of miracles where your desires can and MUST necessarily manifest into existence.\nIn addition to Udemy Completion certificate, I also provide all my students an external certificate from my academy which is an accredited training provider of the International Association Of Therapists.",

Very smart people including world famous scientists, psychologists have been trying to understand what consciousness really is and still are not sure!\nBut consciousness is a very important topic to discuss when mindfulness comes in so I try and tackle this topic with the help of Map of Consciousness.

This is the core of Mindfulness.\n-The Four Noble Truths (the first sermon gave by Gautama—The Buddha when he become The Enlightenment One!\n-The Noble Eightfold Path which is included in the Fourth Foundation is a step-by-step guide for anyone who wants more wisdom and insight into the nature of reality.\n-The Five Hindrances that distracts and disrupts from seeing clearly the nature of reality and with clear awareness.\n-Moving on we will then shift our focus on the Contemporary Model of Mindfulness inspired by Jon Kabat Zinn’s Mindfulness Based Reduction Program.\n-In the west, people like measuring everything. Even though it’s next to impossible to measure mindfulness, but you’ll be surprised to know that there are scales, assessments and models that can actual measure mindfulness.\nI have using these scales for over 6 months now and can actually see tangible positive results in me when going through the questionnaires. You will find these scales and questionnaires it very useful.\n-And then, I will teach you:\nMindful Eating\nMindful listening,\nMindful Working,\nMindful Driving\nMindful Sleeping\nThere is a lot of practical and useable information provided in this course.\nThe theory is also not some ancient scriptures that will bore you to death but rather you will find them very interesting and highly applicable to your lifestyle.\nWell, at least I hope so:)\nMy courses always come with a CPD Certificate but first you need to give the Exam and only then you will be able to secure your Certificate.\nSo this course will be useful for all wellness professional who want to help their clients include Mindfulness as a skill in their lives.\nLastly, do remember all courses like this one gives you lifetime access to all lectures &\n-A Master Mindfulness Manual (covers complete script of this course) is provided which covers all the script.\nI hope to see you on the inside.\nYour Coach,\nAkash\n###IMPORTANT###\nWe offer a CPD Certificate which is different from the Udemy's Certificate of Completion.

If after completing part 1, you decide you would like to move forward and get certified, you will have the option to receive additional training and participate in live virtual Reiki initiations directly with a Reiki Master.\n\n\nMEET YOUR INSTRUCTOR + REIKI MASTER\n\n\nI am Kumari.\n\n\nI was a civil rights attorney when my father died suddenly of lung cancer in 1988. His untimely death became a catalyst for me to master energy medicine in order to ease suffering and heal holistically, and inspired me to spend the next three decades studying and living with world-renowned spiritual teachers, Reiki Masters, family counselors, intuitive healers and coaches.\nWhile meditation is an emptying out, Reiki is a \"filling up\" with spiritual or Universal life force, which I can only describe feels like embodying Unconditional Love and being able to flow it to others. I recommend it as the foundational first step to all my clients, as it opens up your own healing channels, deepens your intuition and spiritual connection, and awakens your awareness as a divine human.\nI credit learning Reiki Level l with setting me on my path to becoming an Internationally acclaimed spiritual teacher, intuitive coach, animal communicator, Reiki Master Teacher and best-selling author.\nI am deeply honored to have facilitated tens of thousands of people…and their beloved animals to achieve profound transformations worldwide.\nEven though I have been teaching Reiki for more than 3 decades, I never lose the wonder and awe of witnessing each new student light up with the reality that they can be a powerful conduit of healing, transformation and profound peace.\nAnd it is my greatest JOY and deepest FULFILLMENT to empower you with Reiki so YOU can have the priceless gift of healing in YOUR hands... whenever you need it.",

Only by learning the original language (in addition to ancient customs) can we fully appreciate the subtle nuances and depth of meaning of the wonderful Gospel of Christ.\nThe beginner course makes memorizing the Greek alphabet easy so you can penetrate a deeper understanding of Greek words rather than trying to capture the ancient meaning with a modern English definition. You will also learn how to speak the Greek words aloud, which is part of learning to think in a different language.\nYou may be comfortable and experienced with conducting word studies. However, this course will help you penetrate the meaning of a Greek word not an English term or expression. Furthermore, we must remember that people at the time of Jesus did not have books as we do. Theirs was an oral society and they would have “heard” anything unusual, which would have led them to a deeper understanding. We must learn to think like the people at the time of Jesus.",

      "description": "Divination is the art of making apparent information that is hidden or not immediately obvious. From the outside looking in , it appear magical, mystical, and maybe even scary, because we may not understand where this information is coming from. Examples  of divination systems are the tarot cards, dowsing with pendulum, crystal ball, palm reading, the l ching and even reading tea leaves. Many would say that the power is not so much in the object or system used as in the person who is using them, and their relationship to the tools.\nMany believe that divination works because all things are connected energetically, and all matter has an innate intelligence. According to the belief, when handling some rocks on a table, you are connected to a higher power because the higher power is connected to the rocks- in a sense, the rocks are alive. If you accept that everything is alive. it could be argued a higher purpose can speak to you through anything - if you can just work out a method of interpreting what an object may say to you. Once you accept that the world is an intelligent place, you can even accept that your car breaking down while you are out for a drive may be a message that you should slow down and relax in your more general life. To believe in divination can be a big step. Many need to practice an art such as tarot for many years before they really begin to accept that it is not just coincidence that the cards keep falling in the right places.",

This course will help you to learn how to harmonize your own energies with the crystals, so that you can empower your intentions in life.\nCrystals Help Manifest Dreams & Overcome Challenges\nOne of the beautiful things about crystals and working with crystal - is just how much they can help you with!\nThere is quite literally a crystal for everything that you may need help with.\nIn this course, you will learn which crystals to use for whatever you need help with.\nYou will also learn how to combine crystals and other energy structures into empowering mediums such as crystal grids and crystal elixirs.\nDoes Crystal Healing really work?\nTo answer that question, please consider this:\nHave you ever been around a sad person, and found yourself, soon-after, starting to feel sad? Or the opposite - felt happier, after being around a joyful and bubbly person?\nWhy? Consider - Could it be that the energy field of the person you are in proximity to has an actual effect your energy field?\nI believe so, as do crystal healers and other energy workers tend to believe so.\nThe reason: energy entangles with energy. Energy effects other energy. You are energy. This is energy. All is energy.\nHave you ever sat by an ocean? Under a tree? Stood your feet upon soft summer grass? Why do these things uplift our spirit? Why does the sunshine make us feel happier?\nEnergy. Energy. Energy. It's all energy.\nNot all types of energy are created equally, just as a sad persons mood can make you feel worse, and a joyous person can make you feel better - we are constantly bombarded by energy frequencies from every angle every day all the time. That is life.\nSo how do crystals help?\nConsider this: You are energy in the temporary form of physical matter (a fairly unstable form of matter in-fact) your life span may last 100 years before your current physical being starts to break down and degrade.\nCrystals are a much longer-lasting form of physical expression. In-fact crystals are millions and even billions of years old - they have an energy pattern which is so stable... and so pure, that it has been around since before the time of dinosaurs.\nAnd each crystal - has a different type of energy pattern (or in other words, can help you with something different). The right tool for the right job and with crystals - you can get very specific about what kind of help you need.\nSo: when you're looking for support - just in the way which you might seek out a stable and supportive (human) friend, someone with a calm and supportive energy... crystals also act as highly stable and support ally.\nIn this crystal healing course - you will lean which crystals to use for what and beyond.\nLet's Look Inside the Course\nThere is an entire world full of new crystal allies for you to discover - indeed many of our students have told us they feel like their crystals are more then just stones - they are friends, and they are allies.\nDiscover your crystal allies.\nHarmonize and balance your life.\nThere are crystals out there that want to help you.\nLet's take a closer look at what you get in this course...\n\n2 Hour Crystal Healing Course Main Module\n16+ Hours In-depth Crystal Knowledge Bonus Lectures\n\n\nCourse Content:\n\nIntroduction to Crystals\nDiscovering your Crystal Allies\nCrystal Care\nThe Crystal Forms\nUnderstanding & Identifying Crystals\nCrystals and the Astrological Star Signs\nThe Healing Properties of Crystals\nThe Power of Intention and Crystals\nPreparing your Sacred Crystal Healing Space\nCrystals to Energize and Empower Your Sacred Space\nCrystals and the Chakras\nCrystal Grids\nEmpowering Your Life with Crystals\nProgramming your Crystals with Intention\nCrystal Elixirs\nUsing Crystals in Your Day to Day\nScrying, Crystals, & Pendulums\nCrystals in Meditation\n16 Hours of Expanded Course Content\nLearn about hundreds of different crystals and gemstones, including:\n\nAmethyst\nMoonstone\nQuartz\nCitrine\nOpal\nJade\nAgate\nRuby...\n+ about 250 MORE CRYSTALS AND STONES!\nEach crystal has it's own video lesson - containing information on how each crystal can help you - how to use it, what chakra's it's connected to, some of it's ancient history and more!",

      "description": "Feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, desperation, hatred, etc are states of mind. You are happy or sad only when you think of whatever it is that gives you those feelings. It is the way you perceive different situations that cause the different states of mind. The fear of losing what, or who, one is attached to leads people to take the wrong decisions, which can have serious repercussions and cause irreversible damages in one's life. Attachment and the fear of losing can make people losers.\nThe Srimad Bhagavad Gita, one of the most important scriptures revered by the followers of the Sanatana Dharma aka Hinduism, is a transcript of the dialogue between Shri Bhagavan Krishna and Arjuna at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, as reported to king Dhritarashtra by his charioteer Sanjaya. The scripture begins with the chapter that talks about the feelings of despondency, weakness and confusion that took over Arjuna's intellect. The despondent state of mind of the valiant, intelligent, and knowledgeable warrior king Arjuna was about to turn him into a coward, destroy his perspicacity and drive him towards delusion, failure, defeat and ignominy. However, Arjuna took the wise decision of requesting Krishna to teach him the way to face, handle, and overcome his challenges.\nResponsible persons usually do not make people feel bad, hurt others, commit social crimes, do things that are against the norms of society or humanity in general. Being responsible means carrying the responsibility for all that one says and does, and not blaming others, the planets, or God for anything that goes wrong in their lives. People are directly responsible for the lives they lead. In a way, even the birth of a person was caused by them, simply because it was their own past Karma that got them their birth.\nReligions thrive, wars are fought, large numbers of people are tortured, enslaved, and killed - all in the name of a celestial being in the sky called God. It is strange that everyone is somehow born in the right 'religion' and that their god is always the true one while all others worship false gods.\nAlmost all organised religions ensure that the thinking faculty of people is under the control of the few that head them. Followers are asked to fear God, blindly follow commandments, and cough up a part of their monthly earnings to the managing body of their religious organisation.\nOn the other hand, the Sanatana Dharma encourages people to ask questions and pushes them to do so and be true to the path of seeking. As against one, two, three, or a few more holy books of the world's major religions, the Sanatana Dharma has an endless library of ancient writings that could take an entire lifetime or more to go through. However, studying the Teachings of Krishna in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita which contains the core philosophy of Vedanta in a condensed form helps a seeker learn to live the life of a true KarmaYogi and Karmically evolve by staying on the path of righteousness through a blessed, blissful, rewarding and fulfilling life.\nOne who completes this course can have a clear understanding of:\nNondualism\nUniversal Oneness\nThe Separation between the five factors that cause all action, whether good or bad\nKarma or Cause and Effect\nDharma or Righteousness\nSelfless Action\nNon-attachment to the results of one's actions, as also to perishable objects\nSocial Responsibility\nI wish you a blessed journey through the 20 video lessons of A.G.E. - A Gita Experience with Tavamithram Sarvada.\nMay you stay blessed with excellent health, freedom, peace, happiness, and prosperity.\nJai Shri Krishna\n\n\nMithram\n(Tavamithram Sarvada - means 'Your friend forever', in Sanskrit)\n\n\n(Please note that Tavamithram Sarvada is neither a baba nor a swami but a great lover of life, nature, people, animals, and philosophy)",

      "description": "In this philosophy of religion course you will learn about the philosophy of religion, which is a branch of philosophy (not theology) that focuses on using rational understand to comprehend various religious phenomenons and beliefs.\nHow Is This Philosophy Course Structured?\nIn the course I present the leading opinions about religion from the top philosophers from the last 2000 years. I cover philosophers starting from Socrates to modern existential and nihilistic views on philosophy, and the evolution of religion from ancient times to the present. I equally present the rationalizations and proofs of God as well as reasons not to believe in God. I also point out when politics takes over, and how to make the distinction, and not let politics take over.\nThe course is 100% objective. At rare times I offer my own opinions, but I always try to give both sides of arguments by philosophers on both sides of the issues I present.\nAdditionally, I NEVER single out any religion or ANY group of people. My goal for this philosophy of religion course was to present it as objectively as possible, and let you decide on your eventual beliefs. I just introduce philosophy of religion approximately as it would be taught in an undergraduate philosophy of religion course.\nYou Will Get Introduced To New Ideas And Perspectives\nReligion is as prevalent and widespread in the world today as it has ever been. I feel that you will find this philosophy of religion course enlightening and thought provoking. I welcome and encourage you to take the course. It will give you a number of perspectives and arguments from which to view spirituality and religion in a new light.\nNo Risk To Take This Philosophy Course\nEvery course on Udemy comes with a 30-day money back guarantee, and so does this philosophy course. So there is no risk to take this philosophy course. If you find that you don't like the course, just get your money back. But I am confident that you will find the course interesting!\nIs This A Philosophy Course Or A Religion Course?\nThis is first and foremost a philosophy course. This course examines the opinions of the major philosophers (not theologists) about religion.\nWhy Is A Philosophy Course Like This Needed Or Interesting For Today's Audience?\nToday, religion is politicized more than ever. It is also endlessly skewed by the media. This is why in this course, we go back to basics, and examine what the smartest people in history had to say about religion.",

      "description": "Dear Students,\nWelcome to the Cord Cutting and Clearing Negative Energy course! I am thrilled to guide you on this transformative journey toward emotional, mental, and spiritual freedom.\nEvery day, we form energetic bonds with people, situations, and even places. While some connections uplift and empower us, others may drain our energy and leave us feeling stuck. This course is designed to help you recognize and release the cords that no longer serve your highest good.\nIn this course, we will explore the fundamentals of energetic cords and their impact on your life. You’ll learn how to identify these connections and practice powerful techniques to release them. Whether you’re dealing with past relationships, lingering negative energy, or simply seeking greater clarity and peace, the tools you’ll gain here will help you on your path to healing.\nOur modules will cover a range of practices, including visualization, guided meditations, and rituals. I’ll also introduce you to the supportive energies of crystals, essential oils, and spiritual guides like Archangel Michael.

      "description": "This is an in-depth 80 hour course that teaches you to be a confident Numerology Reader with the ability to skilfully place and blend a clients numbers to reveal and remind them of their plan or blueprint for this incarnation. The information you will share with your client in your Numerology readings is extremely important, in fact, it's the most important thing your client will ever learn about themselves.  You are reminding your client of why they are here in this life time and you are reminding them of the talents, passions and motivations they brought with them to achieve their life purpose. Your client will be inspired and excited by the information that you provide. Finally, you will be able to advise clients on the best time to act on their life purpose for best results.\nWe are all spirit beings having a human experience, we exist in a balanced virtual reality world that supports our experience and learning over multiple life times until we have no further need to incarnate.  These multiple experiences are what teach our soul valuable lessons for our evolution and we choose to enter each incarnation with a mission to be better and evolve.  Before each incarnation, we discuss with our spirit guide what our next step in our learning and evolution should be.  A soul may have struggled with their emotional expression over one or many life times, so has decided to enter this incarnation with a Life Path 3 to gain experience, learn and improve their emotional expression.  We also discuss other issues and difficulties from a different energy that may need to be developed, the Birthday Number.  When we have clarified our mission and purpose to achieve for this life time (Life Path Number and Birthday Number), we discuss with our spirit guide what talents, motivation and personality energies we will take with us to help us achieve our Life Path. Talents show up in our Expression Number most importantly, but also in our Focus, Maturity and Intensifier energies.  Our Passions and motivations are within our Soul Urge Number and our Personality shows up in our Personality and Expression numbers but as we successfully walk our life path, we may manifest the elements of our Life Path number more noticeably.  When reading for your client, always keep in mind that the client's Life Path Number energy is their most important focus and the client needs to use all their other numbers to support and achieve their Life Path.\nSection 1 and 2 of this course focuses on the most important part of the reading, the client's purpose, their reason for being and the lessons they came here to learn in this incarnation.  A client's Life Path Number (taken from their date of birth using the reduction method) is their main and most important number and the development of this number is of utmost importance, this path will not be easy, your client needs to work towards evolving to transcend their path.  The Life Path contains, and is broken down, into 9 or 10 specific lessons for the client to develop.  ALL of a client's other numbers, Core Numbers and the more minor numbers, exist to support the achievement of a client's Life Path Number, never the other way around.  You could remember this more easily by imagining the Life Path Number as the king of a client's kingdom with all of the other numbers existing to serve this energy's needs, difficulties and challenges. A client's Birthday Number is a sub lesson that focus's a client more deeply into specific life lessons or elements within their Life Path Number.  The birthday number is much less important than the Life Path Number but the development of this number will assist your client with their Life Path.\nSections 3, and 4 and remind the client of the talents and passions (Expression and Soul Urge) they decided to bring with them to help with the development of their Life Path.\nSections 5, 6 and 7 inform your client of the conditions they will be faced with throughout their life, long range Pinnacles and Challenges. Plus their shorter range conditions and their position in their reoccurring 9 year epicycle.\nBy the end of this course, you will feel confident to structure and accurately deliver a client reading.\nCourse Content\n1. Life Path & Birthday number blending to remind your client of their life purpose\n2. Digging deeper into the sub lessons of your client's purpose\n3. Blending your clients Life Path with their Expression & Soul Urge Number to see how your client's talents will impact their purpose\n4. Examples of Core readings\n5. Part 2 of a reading - Long range pinnacles and challenge numbers.\n6. Shorter range Personal Year, month and days\n7.  Examples of part 2 readings\n8. Conclusions and points to think about when starting a Numerology Reader business.",

      "description": "Life can be challenging, especially during times of change and uncertainty. Too often, we become busy or distracted, pushing aside discomfort rather than facing it. This can lead to numbing behaviors, unhelpful patterns, or emotions that feel overwhelming.\nThis course invites you to pause, breathe, and gently explore what lies beneath the surface. By embracing the Shadow—the suppressed and hidden parts of ourselves—we open the door to healing, growth, and greater self-awareness. When we bring these aspects into the light of conscious choice, we begin to transform from within.\nThrough the use of Archetypes, you’ll gain clarity on the deeper aspects of your character, while tools and practices from various healing modalities will support you in navigating change, cultivating self-love, and strengthening your relationships. Honoring and healing your Shadow requires honesty, vulnerability, and compassion—but it is also the pathway to wholeness and spiritual awakening.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nTo understand your Shadow as you deepen your connection with your Soul\nHow the Shadow is formed throughout your spiritual journey\nHow to identify your Shadow through Archetypes\nHealing practices to release deep-rooted wounds\nWays to reintegrate Shadow aspects to create wholeness and unity within\nTo let go, release, and embrace your Shadow as you shift from Self to Soul",

For this you need a high level of sensitivity and (inner) purity. You feel the energy or you don't feel it, nothing can be forced. What I am trying to do in this course is to activate you to open your body and mind so that the tantric energy can flow through you. This happens primarily through purification and devotion to the divine in deep meditation. Your body is nothing but a vessel for this energy, it wants to serve it. Your mind must be still or at least mastered by full consciousness. You must have pure intention and leave your ego behind as you become one with the universe. Your heart must open wide. Then you feel like the fountain of youth itself, dissolved into eternity. Life and death merge into immortality. Your male and female aspects dance together in cosmic - orgasmic love, ecstatic silence. But this is not yours and you cannot hold on to it. It comes when you let go and prove yourself worthy by becoming empty. So in this course you will learn a lot about inner and outer purity, meditation, breathing techniques, theoretical aspects, initiations, natural feelings, heart opening and feminine energy, which will help you open the door to tantric energy.",

      "description": "## Highest Rated Course in Shamanism Topic as of Nov 2023 ##\n===Our Invitation===\nAncient Greek Culture has been woven into the fabric of Western Civilization since its birth over 2000 years ago. We know about the teachings of Plato and Aristotle and their followers but what about the enigmatic figures that stood behind them? Figures like Empedocles and Parmenides that we will be exploring in this course. For me these practical mystics, you could call them Western Shamans represent a kind of jewel, hidden and forgotten in the fabric of our lives. They still walk with us but they've been sidelined... sometimes purposefully so.\nBut who were these ancient 'so called' Pre-socratic figures really? What did they practice? How did they view human life? and what can they offer to us today? To understand this its useful to explore more about Ancient Greek Spirituality. So that is what we will also be doing in this course! Many will be familiar with some of the Greek Myths and understanding the people who crafted them can help us understand and remember more of who we are.\nWhat was practiced in the ancient Greek Sancturaies dedicated to the Gods, the healing dream sanctuaries and at the great mystery traditions like Eleusis?\nIn this course we will go on a voyage of discovery into the world of Ancient Greek Spirituality and we will examine what we have can reclaim by exploring this aspect of our cultural heritage.\nWe will also explore and tune into what we can potentially rekindle in ourselves through the kind of 'soul remembering' that these figures knew so well. In many ways these figures were like Western Shamans and holders of Healing Lineages and can give us an insight in how we can approach Western Shamanism today.\n===What to Expect===\nExpect to dive deep into a treasure house of practices and perspectives that lie as a half forgotten foundation of western culture.\n===What's Included===\n- An overview of perspectives and practices of Ancient Greek Religion\n- Your opportunity to take part in a rekindling of the Eleusinian Mysteries including a Shamanic Journey to find the Goddess Persephone\n- Detailed examination of the Vision and Teachings of two great Mystic Sages Empedocles and Parmenides\n- Learn about the ancient practice of Dream Incubation Healing with the god Asklepios and how we can practice it today!\n- Over 8 hours of material mixing exploration and practical exercises\n- Practical Exercises to Awaken your Psyche, Body and Mind\n- Learn the sacred ancient arts of divination through hydromancy (water divination) and Cledomancy (word divination)\n- Learn also how to awaken intuition to become a natural diviner\n\n\n===About the Facilitator===\nYour facilitator and multiple  Bestselling and Highest Rated tutor Tom Llewellyn has 20 years of experience within the realms of meditation,  psychic development, Kundalini, celtic spirituality, western shamanism, lucid dreaming, astral projection and sound healing. He's also a trained and skilled teacher of Kundalini Yoga and has written two books. Here on Udemy we have over 23000 students from over 145 countries.

You are more than a physical body as you have an energy body as well and this energy body determines how you feel, how people respond to you. The chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head.\nA chakra is a spinning vortex of life force energy within the subtle body. This is a hidden field of life force energy, emotions, beliefs, and imprints that make your specific life force energy. Your chakras are positioned in the spine and open and close much like a flower. There are seven main chakras in the system and each chakra is connected to seven nerve ganglia branching out from the spinal column. The word chakra means wheel or disk in Sanskrit. Chakras are spinning wheels of life force energy when they are functioning correctly in the body. This energy has also been referred to as chi, prana, or life force energy. We can think of the chakra wheel as the drive inside of the computer or as part of the software that helps your body maintain your health. Since everyone is different, each person has different needs and health care problems. The same is true when it comes to the chakra system and determining which chakra needs to be balanced. If you can open your chakras and determine which ones need to be unblocked, then you are able to manifest and align your soul’s imprint with your life purpose. You will find different questions to help you determine your strengths and weaknesses in your chakra system.\nThere are seven main chakras, from top to bottom. All seven chakras affect each other and are interactive; much like any high quality, fine-tuned instrument, so it is important that proper balance be maintained. I will discuss them in detail one by one.\n1. Root chakra\n2. Sacral chakra\n3. Solar plexus chakra\n4. Heart chakra\n5. Throat chakra\n6. Third eye chakra\n7. Crown chakra\nThese seven primary chakras include:\n· Muladhara (root chakra): This chakra is at the bottom of the spine, between the anus and genitals. It purportedly influences the basic urges of sex, food, sleep, and self-preservation.\n· Svadhisthana (sacral chakra): Located at the pelvis, this chakra influences the regulation of emotions and desires.\n· Manipura (Solar plexus chakra): This chakra is just below the navel. Strength in this chakra aids digestion and the ability to process life’s experiences.\n· Anahata (heart chakra): This chakra is located at the heart, and its purpose is to help a person connect with unconditional love.\n· Vishuddha (throat chakra): Positioned at the pit of the throat, this chakra’s function is authenticity and personal expression.\n· Ajna (third eye chakra): Located between the eyebrows, this chakra is a seat of inner knowledge and consciousness.\n· Sahasrara (crown chakra): Located just above the top of the head, this chakra’s role is to promote a more enlightened approach to the world.\nThis course is an in-depth dive into one of the most practical systems of spirituality, and will explain how the health of your energy body affects every part of your life. This chakra course will empower you to heal blockages in your energy body, regain your balance in areas of your life that need attention, and gain a deeper appreciation for yourself and others around you.\nThe chakras are seven bodily energy centers which move from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The word “chakra” is derived from the Sanskrit word for “wheel”, The spinning wheel concept specifies that they are moving, active, vibrating energy points found in living Beings!\nThis is for everyone who are enthusiastic about developing self-mastery and inner healing abilities. You’ll learn about each chakra’s individual characteristics and the possible causes for energy blocks, as well as what happens to your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health when your chakras are in or out of harmony.\nChakras store the energy of thoughts, feelings, memories, experiences, and actions. They influence and direct our present and future mindset, behavior, emotional health, and actions. The life force in each chakra can be processed, transmuted and released so that we consciously manifest what we want to call in, rather than experience more of the same. Chakra healing is the intentional practice of connecting with our stored energy, so we may understand how our past is influencing the present and the future. Prana informs us, and influences our actions and behaviors, determining our health, career opportunities, relationships, and more. The subtle body depicts how our inner reality creates our outer reality.\nThe Chakras of Matter\nEach chakra holds the beliefs, emotions, and memories related to specific areas of our life. The lower chakras are related to Earthly matters such as survival, sex, and power. The top three chakras are related to higher consciousness, truth, intuition, and purpose. In the middle, the heart chakra bridges the two worlds with empathy, love, and compassion.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE ABOUT CHAKRA?\n• Heal and Balance Yourself through the Power of Chakras\n• What is a Chakra?\n• How does a chakra work?\n• How to Heal your Chakras?\n• How to Start Chakra Healing and Balancing?\n• How to Balance your Chakras?\n• Learn to unblock your Chakra\n• Why should you balance your chakras?\n• Understand all about Chakra basics and Color related to each Chakra\n• Learn to create sacred space for Chakra meditation\n• Recognize noticeable issues from blocked Chakras\n• Diagnose whether each chakra is blocked, unblocked or imbalance\n• Practical techniques for balancing & healing of 7 chakras!\n• Realize all about purpose of all 7 chakras\n• Know potential health issues associated with 7 chakras imbalance\n• Identify chakra blockages in your body\n• How Chakra Balancing works?\n• Tips to Heal & Balance Chakras\n• Exercises for Chakra Balancing\n• Details about All 7 Major Chakras\n• 7 Chakra guided Meditations\n• Details of 7 Major Chakras including Root chakra, Sacral chakra, Solar plexus chakra, Heart chakra, Throat chakra, Third eye chakra & Crown chakra!\n• Receive Chakra Healing Certification!\nCHAKRA BALANCING\nYou will be able to create more 'mental space' in short periods of time, achieve more spiritual awareness, relief stress issues, be calmer in your everyday routine and even be able to attract abundance into your life\n· Once you've completed the entire course, you'll receive a beautiful Chakra Certificate of Completion (PDF)\n· Lastly, as I continue to add more helpful information to this course over time, you'll have lifetime access to it!\nThis course is For\n· People who are into Chakra meditation and stress-free lifestyle\n· Those who want to expand their physical & emotional benefits of Chakra clearing, balancing and healing\n· Anyone who is looking for curing and establishing their body, mind, and spirit\n· This course is applicable for all age groups interested in chakra healing & Meditation\n· Anyone who is looking for a more peaceful and balanced lifestyle by balancing chakras\n· Those who want to harness the power of spirituality and cure diseases naturally\nChakra healing is a powerful art that can improve your life in every way—I’m excited to share my love of chakras with you so you can learn to heal yourself from within.\nChakra healing will lead to improved functioning of the endocrine system which is great for physical healing of your body. The connection between glands and chakras represents a link between the energy points in your body to the physiological and physical functions. Another useful entry point for chakra healing is the nervous system which is connected to glands and organs in multiple ways and at multiple points. A chakra healing session is ideally begun by calming the nerves and then targeting a particular gland and/or chakra. By understanding the connection between chakras and the glands, you can use healing in different ways that will help you overcome physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual issues in your body and mind. Connecting the chakras and the glands will help in your overall well-being.\nThis course on the 7 Chakra Complete Healing Practitioner Certification offers an in-depth exploration of the Chakra system and its powerful influence on our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. The Chakra system, originating from ancient Indian spiritual traditions, is based on the belief that energy flows through seven primary energy centers, or Chakras, which correspond to specific parts of the body and aspects of human experience. Each of the seven Chakras—Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye, and Crown—is responsible for maintaining a balance of energy that supports both mental and physical health. When these Chakras are balanced and aligned, they facilitate a harmonious flow of energy throughout the body, promoting healing, vitality, and clarity. However, when any of the Chakras become blocked or imbalanced, it can lead to emotional or physical symptoms, such as stress, anxiety, illness, or lack of purpose. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of how to identify and address these imbalances using various Chakra healing techniques.\nThe history of the Chakra system dates back thousands of years, with its roots deeply embedded in ancient Indian philosophy and spirituality. Early texts such as the Vedas and Upanishads described the Chakras as centers of energy within the human body, each associated with a different aspect of existence, from survival and creativity to communication and higher consciousness. The concept of Chakra healing was further elaborated by yogis and spiritual healers, who developed practices like meditation, pranayama (breathing techniques), and mantra chanting to clear blockages in the Chakra system and promote inner harmony. As the knowledge of Chakras spread across the globe, it became intertwined with practices like Reiki, acupuncture, and modern-day energy healing. In contemporary times, the Chakra system has gained widespread recognition, particularly in holistic healing communities, where it is used as a framework for understanding health and well-being. This course offers modern interpretations and techniques for working with the Chakra system, combining ancient wisdom with contemporary healing practices.\nIn the modern age, the use of Chakra healing has evolved into a holistic approach to health that goes beyond physical treatment, addressing the emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of life. As people seek alternative therapies for stress relief, emotional healing, and personal growth, the Chakra system provides a powerful tool for transformation. In this course, students will learn practical techniques to heal and balance each of the seven Chakras, including meditation, visualization, breathwork, and energy healing. By understanding how the energy of each Chakra affects specific areas of life—such as grounding and stability for the Root Chakra, creativity and emotional expression for the Sacral Chakra, and communication and self-expression for the Throat Chakra—practitioners can offer tailored healing sessions for clients or themselves. These practices help to restore balance, reduce anxiety, improve physical health, and promote overall well-being.\nThe benefits of Chakra healing are vast, with individuals experiencing physical health improvements, emotional breakthroughs, and spiritual growth. For example, a person experiencing chronic fatigue or lower back pain may have a blocked Root Chakra, which is linked to grounding and survival instincts. Chakra healing techniques such as visualization or gentle touch on the Root Chakra can help clear these blockages, increasing energy and vitality. Similarly, emotional issues such as grief, heartache, or lack of self-love may indicate an imbalance in the Heart Chakra, which governs emotional balance and connection. By practicing Chakra healing methods focused on the Heart Chakra, individuals can release negative emotions, foster self-compassion, and open themselves to deeper connections with others. Furthermore, Chakra healing is highly beneficial for mental clarity and spiritual growth. The Third Eye Chakra, which governs intuition and inner wisdom, when balanced, can lead to greater insight and a stronger connection to one’s higher self. Through this course, students will not only learn how to balance and align these Chakras but will also discover how to incorporate Chakra healing into their everyday lives for sustained well-being and inner peace.\nThis course also provides an opportunity to learn how to use Chakra healing as part of a professional practice. Many practitioners in fields such as Reiki, massage therapy, yoga, acupuncture, and psychotherapy have found the Chakra system to be an invaluable tool for enhancing their work with clients. By incorporating Chakra healing techniques into their sessions, they are able to address not only the physical aspects of a client's well-being but also their emotional and spiritual needs. The integration of Chakra healing into a professional practice can foster deeper healing experiences, providing clients with more comprehensive care that addresses the root causes of their symptoms. Moreover, as Chakra healing becomes more widely accepted in the wellness community, there is an increasing demand for certified practitioners who can guide others in the process of Chakra healing and alignment. By completing this course and becoming a certified Chakra Healing Practitioner, students will gain the skills and knowledge to offer effective healing sessions to clients and help them achieve balanced energy flow, improved emotional health, and a deeper sense of connection to themselves.\nIn modern society, where people are constantly navigating stress, emotional challenges, and physical health issues, Chakra healing provides a timeless, holistic approach to self-care. The techniques learned in this course are not only valuable for individual healing but also serve as an effective tool for preventing illness and promoting long-term well-being. With the increasing popularity of holistic and alternative therapies, Chakra healing has become a cornerstone in many wellness practices, offering a natural and non-invasive solution to life's challenges. This course empowers students to tap into the transformative power of the Chakra system, allowing them to use these techniques for personal development, emotional healing, and physical health. By learning how to balance and align the seven Chakras, students can create a healthier, more harmonious life for themselves and others, leading to greater peace, vitality, and spiritual growth.\nThe Chakra system is a holistic entity that suggests that when the one chakra is interrupted, the energy circulation of the whole system is affected. An unbalanced Chakra system causes an unbalanced life; it causes poor physical, psychological, psychological, and spiritual wellness.\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive a Chakra certificate of completion from my side, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers. Certificates of completion help demonstrate your accomplishments.

      "description": "In this online course on Guided Tantra, Kundalini Awakening and Mindfulness Meditation Techniques from Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra you will learn\n\n\nHow to prepare for mediations\n5 Basic mindfulness & concentration meditations you can practice to get habitual for higher forms of meditations\n8 out of 112 Guided Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra including Kundalini Awakening\nAll meditations are guided and come with demonstartion where ever necessary\nAll these meditations can be practiced by beginners without needing a guru or instructor\nYou can start doing these meditations from today onwards\nThe Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra (sometimes spelled in a Hindicised way as Vigyan Bhairav Tantra) is a key Tantra text of the Trika school of Pratyabhijna/Kashmir Shaivism in the Sanskrit language. Cast as a discourse between the god Bhairava and his consort Bhairavi, it briefly presents 112 Tantric meditation methods or centering techniques. These include several variants of breath awareness, concentration on various centers in the body, non-dual awareness, Mantra chanting, imagination and visualization, and contemplation through each of the senses\nIn this course, I cover the 8 principle techniques out of 112. I have made guided meditations of all 8 techniques for easy demonstration of how to practice the techniques.\nTechniques covered in this course give importance to Breath Awareness and Visualization of Kundalini Energy.\nThese tantric techniques are preceded by several basic mindfulness techniques to prepare the mind for tantric meditations.\nThe term for Mindfulness in Sanskrit is Smrti—to recollect, to remember to be in the present moment, now and in the future. In Tantric practice, one will also remember the nature of the breath, that the breath is Consciousness. As Kabir said: the Divine is the breath within the breath\nThus we may term Tantric meditation Meaningful Mindfulness; the remembering not only to meditate on the breath but also remembering that the breath itself is Consciousness; the Inner Witness; the Real Self\nThis form of meditation has the capacity to take us into a deeper state of silence and spiritual depth than mere Mindfulness. And, when remembering, when having attained continuous mindfulness one attains Dhruva Smrti; that is, one experiences continuous remembering. Remembering of what? The remembering that all objects of one’s attention are Sacred are Divine, are bliss",

      "description": "Look at the introductory lecture which describes my new project, A Rabbi Encounters the Universe.  The project will contain an ongoing series of lectures that combine religion, philosophy, and science.  These particular lectures begin to explore one of the most important topics I plan to cover, the creation of the universe.  What can the beginning of Genesis teach us?  Jewish tradition has never read scripture in a literal manner.  On the contrary, Jewish tradition has always allowed multiple interpretations of every verse in the Bible.  In this course we will look at the four classical methods of interpretation found in Jewish tradition - the simple, the rabbinical, the philosophical, and the mystical.  The simple concerns what the words of Scripture meant to the author who wrote them.  The rabbinical looks at other verses of Scripture with hopes of learning insights from one verse to another.  The philosophical approaches the text from within the medieval philosophical tradition.  Finally, the mystical is built on kabbalah or Jewish mysticism, offering a radical new insight.  How does each of these interpretations fit in with how modern science understands the beginning of the universe?  Finally, as we study these four approaches to interpretation, we will learn about the powerful idea from kabbalah that we live in four worlds, each encased in another, like Russian nested dolls.",

      "description": "Socrates once said that “an unexamined life is not worth living,” and that sentiment lies at the heart of this course. In a time when the world moves fast and asks little of our depth, philosophy invites us to pause, to reflect, and to ask the questions that matter most: What is truth? What makes a good life? Is knowledge even possible? These aren’t abstract musings—they are the foundation of how we think, live, govern, and evolve.\nFoundations of Philosophy is your gateway into over 3,000 years of human thought, distilled into a course that is concise, visually rich, and intellectually expansive. With more than 60,000 philosophical texts published globally and over 2,000 academic philosophy programs offered at universities around the world, philosophy remains one of the most respected and enduring disciplines. This course brings you that tradition—in just two hours.\nThrough 25 engaging micro-lessons, each only five minutes long, you’ll explore the five central pillars of philosophy: ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and political philosophy. You’ll learn how to question assumptions, detect contradictions, and sharpen your reasoning—skills that are more essential than ever in an age of misinformation and rapid change.\nYou will journey through the ideas of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Nietzsche, and beyond. You’ll encounter not just their conclusions but their methods—their ways of thinking. Alongside Western traditions, you’ll also explore Eastern schools of thought, including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhist philosophy, discovering how different civilizations approached the same timeless question: How should we live?\nWhat makes this course unique is its pedagogical clarity and modern delivery. Each idea is presented using animations, visual metaphors, and storytelling, making abstract concepts immediately understandable. We’ve condensed hundreds of hours of philosophy into core insights—so that you get maximum depth with no fluff. This is not a traditional lecture course; it’s philosophy reimagined for the 21st-century learner.\nPhilosophy is not just historical—it is living. It’s found in debates over AI and ethics, climate justice, human rights, and the nature of consciousness. It underpins our politics, our technologies, and even our personal identity. The World Economic Forum ranks critical thinking and problem-solving among the top skills of the modern era—skills rooted in philosophical inquiry.\nThis course is crafted not only to teach you what philosophers have thought, but to inspire you to think philosophically about your own life, your choices, and your world.\nBy the end, you won’t just understand philosophy—you’ll be practicing it. So if you're ready to join the centuries-old dialogue that has shaped humanity’s deepest ideas, enroll now. Because the examined life begins here.",

So what are some other ways people communicated with God in the Bible.\nSo many people and religions hold the Bible as an authority on spiritual matters. How did those people in the Bible hear from God? How was the Bible even written?\nIn this course we will explore:\nHow to find answers to life's questions that aren't spelled out exactly for us\nWhat tools are used to communicate with God in the Bible\nWho used those tools in the Bible\nHow to use these tools\nWho should use them today\nIf this is interesting to you but you are NOT sure if you should be looking into this or not then this is my suggestion. Ask God if it would benefit you to learn about this.\nIf you get a clear answer (whether Yes or No) you may not actually need this book.\nIf you don't get a clear answer then maybe learning about communication tools is EXACTLY what you need.",

The questions I get asked the most is:  How do I strengthen my relationship with my guides, How do I see my guides, How do I talk to my guides? In this course I hope to answer these questions and also help people to develop a closer relationship with their guides. We shall be carrying out various exercises that let you feel the presence and power of the guides. Other exercises will let you connect and speak to your guides. I hope to take away some of the clutter that actually stops us working closely with Spirit guides and helpers.\nI hope to achieve this through a series of simple yet effective exercises, that will help the students to relax, maintain and calm mind and focus on what they want to achieve in each exercise. I shall be covering all aspects of trance induction including, \"Tutor led induction, Self led induction & Spirit led induction\".

He is looking for people to come close to Him, talk to Him, and then hear back from Him so they can do His will and receive His promises.\nChas is the Pastor of Houston Faith Church, which he and his wife Joni pioneered in 2002, in Houston Texas, and is now a thriving, Spirit-filled church in the city. In ministry, Chas has dedicated himself to helping others establish a relationship with God through the Word and the Holy Spirit in a way that allows the power of God and love of God to flow and bless many.\nJoin him in this 14 hour course on Establishing a Healthy Prayer Life. The class includes 8 short video clips mixed with 15 full video teachings from live church services with Pastor Chas.\nA good target for completion would be 7 weeks, spending about 2 hours per week on the lectures.",

You were so sure it was the story the group needed to hear to drive the point home, so where did it go wrong? As well, you know down deep that Christian storytelling is of utmost, even ultimate, importance—but struggle to define any difference.\nProverbs 25:11 says, \"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.\" (ESV) My goal is to help you find the right words to tell stories that impart immense spiritual wealth to your listeners.\nI’ve named this course StoryGold®, and its two goals are:\n1. To guide you in how to tell a faith-focused story—a story that helps point your listener toward God and His ways.\n2. To reveal to you how to put those stories together in the middle of your busy schedule.\n\n\nWhat we'll show you is designed to either watch or listen on-the-go. And at the end of the course, you’ll be better able to:\n- spot the right story for your listener\n- find the ending that will bring a new understanding\n- hone in on the details that make a richer story\n- piece together and tell your story quickly\n- create a deep connection with your listener\n- land the ending in a profound, impactful way\nYou'll gain confidence as you learn how to craft the pieces of an engaging story, so whether you're in a conversation, in a classroom, at work, or on the radio, when the opportunity arrives you'll be ready to share a story that truly connects on a heart level and brings the hearer closer to God.",
