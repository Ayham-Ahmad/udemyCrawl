(Don't take my word for it; stop reading now and go put \"devops\" into a LinkedIn job search.)\nIn this Azure DevOps Fundamentals course, Microsoft Certified Trainer and bestselling Udemy instructor Brian Culp guides students on a hands-on tour of Azure DevOps -- Microsoft's cloud-based, open-source tool to help organizations manage development teams,  code, and application deployments.\nBest of all, Brian understands that students taking a Fundamentals course may not yet be familiar with all the vocabulary. This course makes no assumptions about prior exposure to the overwhelming set of terms and technologies that are part of the DevOps landscape... terms like Agile, Scrum, VS Code, App Containers, Commits, Code Requests, Sprints, Unit Testing, Code Artifacts, and literally dozens of others that live at the place where your Development and Operations teams meet.\nIn Azure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners, we take one small step at a time in our journey. It's not a data dump. Instead, the course provides each building block the proper context at the time it's needed. In addition, you'll build your understanding with hands-on guidance using the essential Azure DevOps tools: Boards, Repos, Pipelines, and Test Plans.\nEverything that needs a definition is defined along the way.\n\n\nBrian has been teaching people about Microsoft solutions for over 15 years, and some of his courses have been selected by Microsoft as their official training for Office 365 Administrators. Now, he brings that same expertise to some of the highest-rated courses on Udemy.\nThere's a reason for the hundreds of five-star reviews.\n\"Excellent content!  Just what I was looking for to enhance productivity at the office.\" -Paige Popejoy\n\"Great personality and explained things well. Felt like he was at my desk explaining it to me.\"  -William Potts\n\"I can't believe how much I learned. The instructor is great and the lessons were so easy to follow.\" Sherie L.\n\"Very precise, clear and constructive.\" -Forent Sidler\n\"Perfect.\"  -Yvonne Belo\n\n\nAzure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners is perfect for IT professionals who have heard the term DevOps, but want some hands-on experience, or for project managers and product owners who want to better understand a CI/CD workflow used by development teams.\nIt's even great for the stone-cold noobs out there (we all are at one point, after all) who just want to be able to see if DevOps might be a good career fit.\nYou'll learn by watching and listening, but you'll also learn by doing. By the second lesson, you'll have configured your first DevOps organization. By the time you've finished, you'll have deployed an app into an Azure container, and will have gained additional confidence and expertise about topics like these:\nManaging dev teams using Azure Boards\nMapping work items to your organization's Agile or Scrum processes\nSetting up Git-based workflows in Azure Repos\nConnecting to existing code repos in GitHub\nBuilding code every time a commit is saved to a Master branch\nDeploying a new code artifact when new builds are ready\nPerforming tests of code using Azure Test Plans\nPlus confidence to integrate other tools (Docker, Maven, etc) into your team's DevOps implementation\nBest of all, you become more valuable as companies all over the world scramble - and compete - for workers who understand DevOps. (You did do that LinkedIn search, correct?)\nAnd as always, you get ongoing support. (Brian and the team answers all student questions, usually within one business day). Plus, you're always covered by Udemy's refund policy.\nEnroll now, and discover where your own DevOps journey can lead. See you in class!",

      "description": "Version 5 update released!\nAs of January 2024, this course covers React Query version 5.\n--\n\n\nReact Query (also called TanStack Query) has become the go-to solution for server state management in React apps, and for good reason! This smart, comprehensive solution makes it easy to keep your app up-to-date with data on the server.\nIn fact, if you are using Redux simply to manage data from the server, React Query can replace Redux in your app. And, for server data management, React Query is much simpler and more powerful than Redux. For example, React Query:\ntracks loading and error states for your server queries (no need to manage that yourself!)\nmakes cached server data available for display while you're fetching updated data\nThis course starts with a simple app to learn the basics of React Query version 3:\nqueries\nloading and error states\nReact Query dev tools\npagination and pre-fetching\nmutations\nThen we take a detour with the Star Wars API to learn about Infinite Queries (getting more data just as the user has gotten near the end of the current data).\nFinally, we work on a large, multi-component app to learn about the above in more detail, plus\ncentralizing loading and error handling\nfiltering data\nintegrating React Query with auth\nways to keep data up to date after mutations, including optimistic updates\ntesting React Query\nOther notable course features:\npre-written projects to use as a backdrop for React Query, so there's no time wasted writing code not relevant to the course\nample opportunities to practice with periodic \"code quizzes\" to make sure you're understanding the concepts\nvisual models for complicated concepts to help understand all of the moving pieces\nthe major project is written in TypeScript\nsupportive instructor who loves engaging with students in Q&A\nCome see what the hype is about, and improve your apps with simpler, more powerful server state management!",

We'll start by downloading a demonstration database, and learning how to backup and restore this database, and what recovery models are appropriate for other databases, to enable you to offer Point in Time recovery.\nWe'll manage logins and server roles, so you can control who gets access to what data, implement and maintain indexes, so you can speed up searches, and import and export data. We'll look at managing SQL Server Agent, so you can automate routine tasks, and also be alerted to problems, we'll manage and configure databases, and look at compression, both of which aids with administrating big databases. And much more.\nThe course will take around 10 hours to complete, but completing this will enable you to versed in Database Administration tasks, giving you hands-on experience.\nThe course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll manually backup a database, but then later we'll use SQL Server Agent to automate this. In this course, we will only do activities that require one computer, instead of multiple servers or virtualization.\nThe course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few \"wrong turns\", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual DBA will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.\nNo knowledge of T-SQL is required, as I'll demonstrate everything I can through the GUI (Graphical User Interface) as well as T-SQL. However, if you are going to go for the official Microsoft exam, the equivalent knowledge as per my first two courses in 70-461 T-SQL is essential.\nAt the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, and continue your preparations for the official Microsoft certifications.\nThe course is recorded on SQL Server 2017, but will also work fully in 2022, 2019, 2016, 2014 and 2012, and mostly in 2008R2 and 2008.",

Once you get the fundamentals right, regular expressions(regex) will come naturally to you. I struggled to learn regular expressions(regex) myself a couple of decades back. I completely understand the pain points. I have seen tons of free youtube videos on regular expressions(regex), but they all fail in something fundamental. They do NOT care about getting the basics right. I have taken immense efforts to prepare this course material. Each and every concept, each and every exercise, has been meticulously planned in such a way that it sticks to your brain easily. I have created graphical illustrations wherever possible to drive home the point. Each of the 30 examples come with graphical illustrations on how the regex techniques are applied in a step-by-step way, to come up with a solution.\n\n\nI teach regular expressions(regex) using the POSIX standard. I have done so because the POSIX standard is followed by ALL regex engines. So if you know how to apply the techniques that you learn from this course, you can play around with regular expressions(regex) in ANY programming language of your choice. You could even try it out in Notepad++ (Yes, Notepad++ comes with a basic regex engine.)\n\n\nI have hands-on sessions for ALL the 30 exercises in this course. Even if you are not familiar with the programming language, you will be able to follow it easily and apply it to your case.\n\n\nI have kept my voice narration to a very slow pace on purpose. You can put me on 1.5x or even 2x speed on the Udemy player, if you think I am slow.\n\n\nSomething else that is special about this course - The subtitles are hand-scripted and accurate. I have even checked the timings to guarantee accuracy. Most courses come with subtitles that are auto-generated using a Speech-To-Text Engine, the accuracy of which is fairly low. But not mine! I have taken pains to script my course to perfection and include the subtitles too.

      "description": "Data is like Energy!\nAs you probably know, data is everywhere. Data is the energy that drives many business companies and organizations worldwide. If data is like energy, we need a storage container and an engine to store and access this energy, the data. A storing container that will be flexible, fast, reliable, easy to manage, and cost-effective.\nOver the last couple of years, the application requirements to store and handle data changed dramatically. There are more data types to manage, higher volumes to operate, and a need to keep the data for a longer retention time.\nDatabase Technologies and DBaaS\nAs you may guess, the container and the engine for running this energy, the data for the upper layer applications are all about databases. Selecting the right database technology for a specific use case can dramatically affect any aspect of an application. Modern applications are using a variety of database technologies optimized for different use cases.\nThis training is about databases technologies and, even more specifically, how such technologies are offered as cloud database services (DBaaS) by leading public cloud providers – Azure, AWS, and GCP. We will learn the technical concept, market use cases, advantages, and disadvantages of each database technology while following its evolution path.\nAre you ready to explore the world of Database Technologies?",

      "description": "In the past decade cloud computing has been gaining popularity at a tremendous rate. Some cloud providers are experiencing a growth rate of 50% year over year – which is just astounding. And the reasons for this growth is obvious – cloud computing enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort.\nAs companies across the globe enjoy the benefits of public cloud infrastructure – they also want to leverage the same principles of cloud computing and bring those benefits to how they manage their own private data centers or build private clouds on top of public cloud infrastructure. These private cloud deployments provide secure and highly efficient way to install, configure and manage pooled computing resources which could be shared among various departments or groups within the organization. The provisioning and consumption of these pooled resources become much smoother and consumers can use these resources on self-service basis eliminating lengthy provisioning wait times etc.\nOpenStack is a free and open-source software platform for building and managing our own IaaS cloud infrastructure. This cloud software platform comprises of various services and components which can configure and manage control hardware pools of computing power, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. Users either manage it through a web-based dashboard, through command-line tools, or through a RESTful API.\nIn this course we will learn about OpenStack and its various components and services. We will get an in-depth look at how we can use OpenStack to deploy and manage our own private cloud infrastructure.\nKnowledge and experience on cloud computing and OpenStack are highly sought after by startups and large enterprises alike. The demand for these skills have been steadily increasing over the last few years. We will also go through some evidence about just how valuable these skills are and how the demand for these skills is growing.\nIn this course we will:\nLearn about cloud computing\nLearn about OpenStack\nDeploy our own OpenStack IaaS cluster\nLearn about various sub-components of OpenStack\nLaunch virtual instances on OpenStack\nLearn about sub-components and usage of various OpenStack services\nLearn about how to architect high availability OpenStack clusters\nLearn about managing and troubleshooting OpenStack\nLearn about log management for OpenStack cluster",

This is why there are many many quizzes and code assignments/problems to solve in this course. No one learns to swim or ride a bicycle by attending lectures on swimming or biking and so it is with coding. You have to write the code, make mistakes, solve those mistakes and repeat. That is the only way to learn.\nA strong foundation is necessary for any new endeavor and if it seems that the course is a bit slow in the beginning, it is a deliberate choice to ensure that students have the requisite knowledge to proceed to the more challenging portions.\nStudent feedback is a very important to me. It allows me to change portions of the course if necessary. Please don't hesitate to ask pertinent questions and I will answer them ASAP.\nSome of the topics:\nData types, variables, operators.\nConversions between Data types\nOperators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison\nOperators: Logical, Identity, Membership, Bitwise\nfor loops, while loops and if-else branching\nFunctions: Parameters, arguments, return values\nFunctions: Positional and Keyword Argument\nFunctions: Default Values for parameters\nFunctions: Variable positional and Keyword arguments\nFunctions: Local and Global Scope of variables\nFunctions: Enumerate, Map, Filter, Reduce, Zip, Lambda\nFunctions: Closures and Decorators\nFunctions: List and Dictionary comprehensions\n\n\nModules and Packages\nBuilt-in modules: os, sys, random, datetime, logging, math\ntry-catch error handling\nUnit tests\nFile handling: Text, CSV and JSON\nRegular Expressions (regex)\n\n\nObject Oriented Programming: Classes, Instances\nOOP: Class and Instance attributes, class and instance methods\nOOP: Instance creation step-by-step and the concept of self\nOOP: Instance Properties and attribute validation\nOOP: Class Inheritance and inherited attributes and methods\nOOP: The concept of super\nOOP: Method Resolution Order(MRO) for multi-level and multiple inheritance\n\n\nWeb: Using simple HTTP methods via the requests module\nWeb: Sending and receiving SMS messages using Twilio\nWeb: Setting up a web server using Flask micro-framework\nWeb: Dynamic HTML websites using Jinja2 templates\nWeb: Connecting to a SQL database\nWeb: Using Bootstrap4 in the website\nWeb: Putting it all together to create a frontend and a backend.\n\n\nData Analysis: Basics and Numpy\nData Analysis: Numpy nD arrays and characteristics\nData Analysis: Pandas dataframes\nData Analysis: Dataframe manipulations, groupby and conditional extraction\nData Analysis: Visualization of data using matplotlib and pandas\nData Analysis: Visualization of data using Seaborn.\nThere are ~80 quiz questions and ~35 programming exercises with the solutions in this course.",

In this course you will apply these concepts to embedded code and system software in C.\nThis course introduces the Unity framework, key principles, and a variety of techniques so that you can apply Unit Testing and Test Driven Development in complex and low-level C code. Once you’ve completed this material or if you’re already familiar with TDD and xUnit frameworks our course Interaction Testing, Mocking & Embedded Software in C is a great next step.\nDr. Surly’s School for Mad Scientists\nWhen you’re trying to take over the world you learn two things quite quickly. First, you end up building lots of technology like death rays and such that requires high quality firmware. Second, minions, climate-altering satellites, and lairs are expensive. While Dr. Surly’s lab has become quite proficient at software design and testing, supplemental revenue to fund all manner of villainy is a necessary evil. It’s all part of the standard world domination business model, and you get to benefit.\nIn This Course You Will:\nDevelop in C using Test Driven Development. Write real, executable tests on your first day.\nLearn concepts from Agile, XP, Scrum, and Lean practices for producing well designed, high quality, scope-managed, and self-documented code.\nUtilize the free, open source tool Unity in real-world testing scenarios. No toy examples.\nFollow us through real-world programming examples and see techniques and patterns for unit testing tricky code.\nEncounter big idea philosophies for process, design, and testing.\nApply your new skills to challenging practice problems.\nConnect with a supportive community.\nLearn How To Apply Unit Testing To Your Embedded and System C Software\nYou will learn skills that have become staples in higher level languages but are sadly underutilized in the C world. In particular, you will learn to write unit tests in the uniquely challenging setting of embedded and system software.\nOf course, the test-driven techniques you will learn produce code that enables thorough, smart testing. But, a happy side effect of TDD is code that tends to adhere to generally good design principles. You won’t only be learning testing in this course but also good design.\nThis Course Includes:\n0x1D (29) Code-centered lectures\n0x05 (5) Development projects\n0x12 (18) Helpful resource-packed supplemental primers, guides, and how-to's\nLinks, quizzes, helpful hints, and more\nCan’t decide?

      "description": "FFmpeg is often called the Swiss Army knife of video transcoding/streaming. It is one of the most popular multimedia frameworks out there, which is free, open-source, and cross-platform. FFmpeg is used by many popular and important applications and services, such as YouTube, iTunes, and VLC.\n\n\nFor its support of a wide range of codecs and containers, FFmpeg is the most commonly used tool for transcoding/converting audio/video from one format to another. It has a huge collection of filters that can be combined to manipulate and transform media in many different ways.\n\n\nThis course aims to be your comprehensive guide into the world of FFmpeg. The sections of this course are carefully planned to make it very easy to get started with FFmpeg in a short time. The lectures are organized with diagrams and hands-on examples, so that you can master the core concepts of FFmpeg in order to build complex media manipulation pipelines with efficiency.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding about how FFmpeg works and how to put FFmpeg commands together to perform media processing tasks like transcoding, streaming, and other workflows.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. No prior knowledge of video, transcoding, or FFmpeg is needed. All you need is a working terminal where you can practice the commands yourself.\n\n\nObjectives\nGet a good overview of FFmpeg and its applications.\nSet up FFmpeg on popular operating systems.\nInspect any media with ffprobe to extract valuable information.\nPlay audio/video with ffplay from the command line.\nLearn the basics of audio/video, codecs, and containers.\nUnderstand what happens during transcoding.\nHave a crystal clear understanding of FFmpeg architecture and internal pipeline.\nConstruct complex filter graphs to manipulate media.\nLearn about different inputs, outputs, and stream selection.\nUnderstand factors for choosing a codec.\nEncode audio/video using various codecs with FFmpeg.\nLearn and apply rate control techniques and additional details for H.264 encoding.\nUnderstand how media streaming works\nLearn about popular streaming protocols including RTMP, SRT, HTTP\nLearn details about progressive download of single-quality media\nUnderstand adaptive streaming concepts\nLearn about HLS and MPEG-DASH\nGrasp the details around encoding media for adaptive streaming\nGenerate HLS and MPEG-DASH streams with FFmpeg\nLearn about some very useful and practical applications where FFmpeg can be used.\nPerform common video manipulation tasks by constructing filter graphs with FFmpeg.\nSeparate, mix, and manipulate audio with FFmpeg audio filters.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is NOT covered in this course (yet)\nBuilding FFmpeg from source code - this is not covered\nUsing FFmpeg libraries separately from your code - this is not covered. Only command-line examples are shown.\nIt is nearly impossible to discuss all the details of all codecs, containers, and filters. So only a few common ones are discussed, so that you can apply the same concepts for others.\n\n\nWho this course is for\nAnyone who wants to know about and work with audio/video, streaming, and FFmpeg\nDevelopers/engineers working with audio/video (or even image) in any way\nSystem integrators or administrators dealing with multimedia and streaming\nTake a look at the course outline for examples of what FFmpeg can be used for. If you have a similar requirement and would like to learn the tricks along with a bunch of other cool stuff, this course is for you!\n\n\nMoney-back guarantee\nIf you are not satisfied with the course for some reason, I offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Andaleeb (Syed Andaleeb Roomy). I have been working as a software engineer professionally for more than 14 years. My experience includes diverse domains and complex software systems, including video transcoding, broadcast asset management workflows, VoIP, SaaS, AWS, cloud, microservices, and network communication solutions. I have been using FFmpeg to build transcoding pipelines for supporting many different media asset management workflows including search, transcription, proxy and editing.",

I have spent a year scouring the web looking for the best examples, the simplest explanations, the best visualizations on how to explain how this stuff works, and assembled it all into one, quick, easy to digest place.\nLet's do this together\nLearning data structures and algorithms doesn’t have to be a chore. It can be fun. And I want you to know I am here for you every step of the way. Ask me any question. I usually get back to my students with 24 hrs. And together, we will get you the understanding behind how these things work.\nI also don’t have a formal computer science background\nLook. I know what it’s like not to know how this stuff works. And, like you, I have had to learn this stuff from scratch.\nBut I am here to tell you it can be done. I have no formal computer science background.

And so can you.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Sign up and get started on your journey today.\nTestimonials\nThis is the best course I ever had, very organized, clear explaining and easy to understand topics. The important thing, I was able to pass and solve, the coding interview as iOS developer, after taking this course. Many thanks Jonathan.\nThank you for this amazing course. I have been developing iOS for almost 7 years now. honestly I didn't know about 90% of the topics that you are covering in this course. Thank You!\nThe instructor is valid, truly humble and fun. It's been a pleasure to follow this course.\nI am leaving a 5 star here because not only does this course expose you to Algorithms and DataStructures, it builds your confidence for any interview and you learn that we are all human and can't always be perfect with our approach. Had two Algorithms & DataStructure interview with two big techs and solved passed the Stage.\nBy the time I had taken this course I had already built my first app \"janet.\" and had it launched on the App Store. After the launch I started looking for an iOS developer position at a tech company. Come to find out that although I had cloned dozens of different kinds of popular apps and successfully launching my own, I didn't know the things I needed in order to get a job as a developer. After getting a few books, taking a few courses on swift data structures and getting through to the last round of the Facebook interviews, I found this course. After completing this course over a weekend, I started crushing coding challenges and really understood the code that I was writing. Not even a month later I landed my first iOS Engineering position! Jonathan has been the best instructor I have found for iOS on Udemy. I just purchased his new course Professional iOS Development and I can't wait to go through it! Thanks for everything so far, Jonathan!\nThis course has been fantastic for filling in the gaps in my programming knowledge! I am feeling much more confident about answering questions in a tech interview now!\nAmazing course, worth taking even if you are intermediate/advanced and want to refresh concepts. The instructor is phenomenal!! Thank you so much for making this course!!",

      "description": "Add identity management capabilities to your app using the the power of Azure AD and Azure AD B2C!\nIdentity management, comprised mainly of storing user details, authentication and authorization, is not easy to develop and implement, and becomes even more difficult when trying to add some advanced capabilities such as Multi-Factor authentication, conditional access and more.\nAnd in this course, you're going to learn how to do just that using two of the most powerful identity management services in the industry - Azure AD and Azure AD B2C, part of Microsoft's public cloud - Azure.\nThese two services, that are quite similar but have their differences, offer robust, secure and flexible identity management capabilities, allowing, among the rest:\n- Storing user details\n- Implement sign-in flow\n- Customizable user interface\n- Advanced sign-in capabilities\n- Localization\n- API Authentication\nAnd lots more.\nAnd all this - with minimal coding (usually less than 10 lines of code), and full compatibility with multiple development platforms.\n\n\nDo you want to become an expert in these services and add their advanced capabilities to your apps?\nWell - this course is for you!\nIn this course we're going to learn Azure AD and Azure AD B2C from the very basics to the most advanced concepts, used only by few.\nSome of the topics we'll cover in this course include:\n- Authentication basics (OAuth2, Open ID Connect and more)\n- Adding authentication to a web app\n- Adding authentication to other app types\n- Customizing the authentication\n- Conditional Access\n- Multi-Factor Authentication\n- Authenticating API\n- User Flows\n- Social Identities\n- Custom Policies\n- API Connectors\n- Single Sign-on\nAnd lots more...\n\n\nNow, I wanted to make this course as effective as possible, and so I designed it to be extremely practical and hands-on. Yes, there are slides in this course for learning the theoretical parts, but quite quickly we're going to dive in and actually work with Azure AD and Azure AD B2C.\nWe're going to work on a web app for a fictitious HR start-up, and add to it authentication and authorization using Azure AD and Azure AD B2C. And after adding the basic authentication capabilities, we're going to improve and customize it, adding features such as Conditional Access, MFA, branding, custom page contents, Facebook and Google integration, API Connectors and more. And all this - using clear demonstration and guidance which are easy to follow and implement.\nAnd note: In order to take this course,\n- You don't have to be a cloud developer\n- You don't have to know anything about Azure AD or Azure AD B2C\n- Your app does not have to be installed in the cloud\n- In fact, you don't have to know anything about the cloud\nWe're going to learn everything from the very beginning.\n\n\nThere is no other course like this! This is the most comprehensive, practical and easy-to-follow course about Azure AD and Azure AD B2C. And by the end of this course - you'll be a real Azure AD Expert!\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my Azure courses\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"This is the best Azure course I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere. And I say this after buying 8 different Udemy Azure before\" - Arbaaz\n\"One of the best Azure classes in the world\" - Kkvi1357\n\"One of the best courses I've done at Udemy - top among maybe 50-100\" - Russ\n\"Memi is a true architect willing to get his hands dirty!\" - Kevon\n\"Excellent\" - Ashwani\n\"Highly recommended\" - Shashank\n\"I am loving it <3 the best part is the project based learning !\" - Juhi\n\"The best course I have taken on Udemy\" - Eslam\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny person who is involved in Software Architecture & development, even system analysts, can profit from this course.\nThat includes:\n- Software Architects\n- Junior developers\n- Senior developers\n- Architects\n- Anyone who is interested in identity management\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's a good idea to have some basic knowledge about software development, but it's not a must.\nIn any case, you don't have to have any prior knowledge of the cloud in general, and specifically of Azure!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been working with Azure for more than 10 years, spanning dozens of customers from various fields - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nIn addition, I am a certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert.\nI've been in the software industry for more than 20 years, and a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns and services.",

      "description": "Updated description 3/12/2024\n\n\nGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard are making data engineering more accessible and more efficient. If you work with spreadsheets or business intelligence tools but aren't too familiar with Python or SQL, then generative AI can help you analyze data and build your own data pipelines and ETL/ELT processes.\nGenerative AI and LLMs will not replace data engineers or data analysts but those who know how to use these AI tools will be able to build more capable and reliable data pipelines faster. They will also have access to a tool that can help you develop your Python, SQL, and data modeling skills by providing a variety of examples of functional code and help with error messages and troubleshooting processes that do not work as expected.\n\n\nLearn Data Engineering Techniques as Well as Data Engineering Tools\nIn this course, you will learn how to break down data engineering problems into a series of tasks that can be automated using Python, SQL, and command line scripts generated by a large language model (LLM).\n\nPrompting an AI to \"generate a data processing script to do X, Y, and Z\" will probably not get you the results you expect. LLMs are powerful tools, but they are not oracles. As with any tool, we need to understand what the tool is capable of and how to use the capabilities to meet our needs.\nThis course shows you how to think through a data transformation and loading problems, incrementally building components of a solution. This course is organized into several topics that cover the fundamental skills needed to begin work in data engineering using GenAI, including:\n\nIntroduction to large language models, foundation models, and other AI topics related to data engineering. This course uses Claude AI from Anthropic, a large language model that is both well suited to data engineering code generation and free to use.\nWorking with CSV and JSON files\nData quality and data cleaning, including statistics and visualizations\nExtraction transformation and load (ETL)/ extraction, load, and transform (ELT) processes\nRelational and NoSQL databases\nData modeling using dimensional data model patterns\nWorking with JSON data in relational databases such as PostgreSQL\n\n\nThe course begins with the most basic of data engineering tasks: working with files. You will learn how to quickly filter, transform, and find problems in data sets made up of comma-separated value (CSV) and JSON files. You'll also see how we can create samples from large data sets to efficiently experiment with different solutions to our data engineer needs. You will learn how to generate code that uses command line utilities like awk, a text processing and data extraction tool, and jq, a tool for parsing, filtering, and transforming JSON data. If you are not familiar with tools like awk and jq, that is no problem. In this course, you will learn how to describe what you want in a solution so the LLM can choose an appropriate tool for the job.\nData quality is a primary concern in any data engineering project. Fortunately, with GenAI and a basic understanding of data quality checks, you can quickly generate scripts to check for common data quality problems and apply transformations to the data to correct for those problems. Statistics and visualizations are important tools for ensuring data quality. In this course, you will learn how to use basic statistics and visualizations to help with data quality and data exploration. And because generative AI is used to generate code, you can spend more time learning about statistics, visualizations, and how to apply them to your problem domain and less time trying to find syntax errors or debug a logic error in your code.\nDatabases are the foundation of many applications and data analysis platforms. You will learn about relational databases as well as NoSQL databases and when to use them. Databases are complicated systems that require that we describe how we want to structure our data. This process is known as data modeling. This course will introduce data modeling with a focus on dimensional modeling, a commonly used data model pattern in data analytics. You will also learn how to generate SQL code to implement dimensional models, load data into your database, and query and analyze data once it is loaded.\n\nNow is a great time to become a data engineer because the demand for data engineering skills is high and we now have tools in place that allow us to focus on the problems we are solving while accelerating how quickly we can create scalable, reliable data pipelines.",

Then, it dives deep into LLM evaluation metrics.\nThis course shows you how to effectively use the RAGAS framework library to evaluate LLM metrics through scripted examples. This allows you to use Pytest assertions to check metric benchmark scores and design a robust LLM Test/evaluation automation framework.\n\n\nWhat will you learn from the course?\nHigh level overview on Large Language Models (LLM)\nUnderstand how Custom LLM’s are built using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture\nCommon Benchmarks/Metrics used in Evaluating RAG based LLM’s\nIntroduction to RAGAS Evaluation framework for evaluating/test LLM’s\nPractical Scripts generation to automate and assert the Metrics Score of LLM’s.\nAutomate Scenarios such as Single turn interactions and Multi turn interactions with LLM’s using RAGAS Framework\nGenerate Test Data for evaluating the Metrics of LLM using RAGAS Framework.\n\n\nBy end of the course, you will be able to create RAGAS Pytest Evaluation Framework to assert the Metrics of RAG- (Custom) LLM’s\n\n\nImportant Note:\nThis course covers Top 7 Metrics which are commonly used to Evaluate and test the LLM’s. Same logic can be applied to rest of any other metric evaluations.\n\n\nHandson Experience:\nCourse provides Practice RAG -LLM for you for Handson, but at scripting phase, you need a basic subscription of Open AI to access their API’s (Minimal 10$ credit will suffice)\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites:\nPython, PyTest basics are required to understand the Framework.\nWe have 2 dedicated sections at the end of this course which gives you necessary knowledge on Python & Pytest required to follow the course.\nBasic knowledge on API Testing.",

So not only am I going to explain them to you, you will actually be able to see exactly what I am doing. Since my keyboard is RGB, whenever I press a key it will light up and you will see exactly what is going on!\nOver 60 shortcuts and tips compiled in a PDF cheatsheet that you can download, print and have it by your side at all times to quickly find a shortcut that you are not yet used to use.\nBefore you proceed, I want you to have the right expectations from the course! The course will not magically transform you in a speed coding guru! You have to practice and implement the shortcuts that you feel would be helpful to you into your coding habits (this is where the cheatsheet comes into play). Only then the full effect of the discussed material will be allowed to shine and increase your productivity and speed.\nThe course is aimed at students that want to get more familiar with the Visual Studio Software and/or want to become more productive and write code faster.\nThe only coding in the course is when we create our snippets (which is done in XML and thats extremely easy!), so even coding beginners will manage to complete the course!\n\nThe topics that we are covering are:\nNavigating and Selecting - you will learn various ways and shortcuts that will help you quickly navigate through your code in your current file, find code in other files, select portions of code quickly and so much more\nCode Editing - different ways to efficiently cut or copy your code, undo mistakes, correctly format the spacings in your code (automatically), quickly rename a variable with just 2 clicks and more\nDifferent Ways to Comment Code - you will learn a cool trick to turn on/off parts of your code with comments or alternate between two versions of code, with just 1 click\nManaging Your Workspace - distraction free mode, multiple coding windows and more\nDebugging Efficiently - correctly run your code without the need of \"Console.ReadLine();\" at the end to hold the Console window, debug your code efficiently with breakpoints and their special derivatives like Conditional Breakpoints and Actions Breakpoints\nSnippets - this is the one single thing that will let you highly customize Visual Studio to your specific needs and marginally increase your productivity and speed\nStylecop - a tool developed by Microsoft for developers to easily check your code for any styling mistakes, increases the quality of your code\nFor me the highlight of the course is the Snippets section, as this is one of the things that let you highly customize your coding experience and tailor it to your specific needs.\nThere are tons and tons of tutorials on Youtube and other websites, so why would you have to pay for this course?\nThe answer is very simple, in this course you will get every single lecture systemized in such way, that it ensures smooth transition between the previous and the following topic. Guaranteeing great learning experience.\nThere are no stones left unturned, everything is explained in great detail (but not too much, that would be boring :) )\nThe video lectures in the course are produced with the highest possible audio and video quality. No static noises to disturb you while you watch the videos, no blurry images, everything is crystal clear with crisp audio!",

      "description": "Composite materials are created by combining two or more layered materials, each with different properties. These materials have become a standard for products that are both light and strong. Composites provide enough flexibility so products with complex shapes, such as boat hulls and surfboards, can be easily manufactured. Engineering layered composites involves complex definitions that include numerous layers, materials, thicknesses and orientations. The engineering challenge is to predict how well the finished product will perform under real-world working conditions. This involves considering stresses and deformations as well as a range of failure criteria. ANSYS Composite PrepPost provides all necessary functionalities for the analysis of layered composite structures.\n\n\nThis tutorial has been divided to 11 sections. in order to get the best result please follow tutorials step by steps if you are beginners.\n\nThe first section of this tutorial is an introduction to Ansys software and ACP tools. You will learn how to add ACP tools into project schematic and create very simple geometry.\n\n\nIn the second section you will learn about tools inside ACP such as Draping, Rules, Rossete, Orientation. This section is crucial for everyone in order to continue tutorials. This section all tools explained step by step (PLEAEE DO NOT MISS THIS SECTION)\n\n\nIn the third section, you will learn how to model T beam shape in ANSYS ACP and do stress Analsys. This is a good example for beginners to test their modelling skills in ACP software.\n\n\nBuckling is one of the important subject in composite material. Therefore, the whole section four is dedicated to this matter to find eigenvalue for simple composite plate\n\n\nACP tool can be coupled with other ACT extensions such had honeycomb creator. In this section, you will learn how to create honeycombs and combine that with composite model in ACP.\n\n\nIn the section sixth, seventh and eighth you will learn how to combine model with mechanical model and ACP. Three different mechanical examples have been solved with ACP and mechanical model in ANSYS workbench. DO NOT MISS SECTION 6\n\n\nSections 9, 10 and 11 are dedicated to fatigue, natural frequencies, failure such as rebounding, delamination and progressive failure. PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO THESE SECTION WITHOUT DOING PREVIOUS SECTIONS IF YOU ARE BEGINNERS. This course has around 1800 students so far and I noticed some students skip the basic tutorials and jump to advanced examples then they complain that videos did not cover everything. In order to have the best of this course is better to start from basic and learn all the tools from section 1 to 5 then you would be able to create any model in ANSYS ACP.\n\n\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy this tutorials. Please send me message if you think anything can improve the quality of this course as I am updating course regularly.\nMany thanks\nArmin\n\"All rights reserved,Any unauthorized broadcasting, public performance, copying or re-recording will constitute an infringement of copyright\"",

      "description": "Getting started with cloud technologies can be daunting with the number of cloud providers in the market and also hundreds of services, in the form of building blocks, offered by each cloud provider. But it is important to understand these services or building blocks which are used to create and deploy any type of application in the cloud. Also, cloud providers offer on-demand computing resources and services in the cloud, with pay-as-you-go pricing which saves cost. So, every organization is migrating to the cloud in order to save money.\nThis course is an introductory level course for understanding the cloud technology concepts and gives a detailed introduction to the three largest cloud providers: Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\n\nSummary of the course:\nThe course is divided into 5 main sections.\nIn the first section, we will look at basic cloud concepts and compare cloud with the alternative self-hosted IT infrastructure. We will understand the difference between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).\nIn the following three sections, we will introduce each of the three public cloud providers in detail: Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nIn each of these section, we will take a look at the brief history of the cloud provider and its reach with its global infrastructure. As this is a beginner level course, we will go through step-by-step instructions on creating a new account on the cloud providers' web portal. After that we will take a quick tour of the portal.\nWe will go through all the categories of services provided by the cloud provider and core services in each category. We will design a simple architecture using the core services we learned to understand how cloud can be used in real world scenarios.\nFor experimenting with services, each cloud provider offers 'Free Tier' either limited by time or amount of usage after creating a new account. It is important to understand the free tier limits to minimize the cost and optimize the usage.\nWe will look at ways of interacting with the cloud provider services and their infrastructure like API, CLI and SDK.\nFor those who are interested in learning more about the cloud provider or cloud technology in general, I’ll list some podcast, blog and events that I recommend.\nFor those interested in certifications, we will look at the official certification offered by each cloud provider and figure out which certification path you should choose.\nAnd in the final section of the course, we will compare the three cloud providers and discuss which one to use in a particular use case.\n\n\nThis course is approximately 5 hours long in total, and the approximate time division is as follows:\nOverview of cloud - 30 min\nAWS Introduction - 1hr 30 min\nAzure Introduction - 1hr 25 min\nGCP Introduction - 1hr 14 min\nComparing AWS, Azure and GCP - 15 min",

Obviously, the main focus will be on the Genetic Algorithm as the most well-regarded optimization algorithm in history.  The Genetic Algorithm is a search method that can be easily applied to different applications including Machine Learning, Data Science, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.\nWith over 10 years of experience in this field, I have structured this course to take you from novice to expert in no time. Each section introduces one fundamental concept and takes you through the theory and implementation. The course is concluded by solving several case studies using the Genetic Algorithm.\nMost of the lectures come with coding videos. In such videos, the step-by-step process of implementing the optimization algorithms or problems are presented. We have also a number of quizzes and exercises to practice the theoretical knowledge covered in the lectures.\nHere is the list of topics covered:\nThe inspiration of the Genetic Algorithm\nSelection or survival of the fittest\nRecombination or crossover\nMutation\nElitism\nImplementation\nApplication\n\n\nI am proud of 200+ 5-star reviews. Some of the reviews are as follows:\n\n\nFemi said: \"I really enjoyed the instructor style of explanation. He has a very solid understanding of the course and he made complex problems fun to solve.\"\n\n\nAbhay said: \"I tread cautiously when am taking MOOCs, as most of the courses offered fall short of what they claim they have to offer, eventually ending up quitting the course after making, say, 10% progress. But this course is different, after completing almost 80% - 90% of the course, I can say with confidence, that this is one of the most worthy courses I have undertaken on the topic of GA. The course is precise, relevant to the real-world problems and Ali is quite an engaging and prompt instructor. Hell, even the Possums in Australia would double that.\"\n\n\nAhmad said: \"It was very nice experience. I think the course is designed very well for beginners like me because it starts with the basics. Then it gradually becomes more difficults. Overall it was a great course. Thanks Ali or Seyedali both of you :D :) if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\nJoin 1000+ students and start your optimization journey with us. If you are in any way not satisfied, for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days. No questions asked. But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to help you along the way.",

And both are right! How comes?\nIn this course, you will learn how design patterns can be applied to make code better: flexible, short, readable. Flexibility is the key element in design patterns. You will learn how to decide when and which pattern to apply by formally analyzing the need to flex around specific axis. You will learn which pattern is adding which kind of flexibility, and what are the most common forms of implementation in practice. You will also learn common pitfalls and ways to overcome them when applying specific patterns.\nThrough a series of demonstrations, you will learn one design pattern at a time. In each demonstration, we shall start from an existing implementation which faces difficulties to accommodate the next requirement proposed by the customer. That will invariantly trigger a series of designing attempts, some doomed to fail, others having prospect to succeed. But what will learn in this course, is that each successful design will exhibit one kind of flexibility, which will be of critical importance to support the troublesome request posed by the customer. It will come as no surprise to you to learn that each such special kind of flexibility will be one specific design pattern.",

      "description": "With the advent of Cloud Computing the biggest challenge that is being faced by the DBA's & Solution Architects is how to migrate the On-Prem Oracle Databases onto the Cloud. This course teaches you all the different Strategies and methods that you can use to migrate from On-Prem to Oracle Cloud (OCI) along with a method to migrate from AWS RDS to OCI as well.\nPlease note the same strategies can be used if you are looking to migrate your Oracle Database to IaaS based Cloud Services in AWS(EC2) / Azure / OCI  & GCP as well.\nWe shall start our migration journey with some discussion around : the factors that help you to choose your migration strategy, from here we will discuss two main concepts which drive a Migration Strategy and they are Endianness & Database Character Sets. As the biggest bottleneck in any Database Migration exercise is Nework Bandwidth hence we will discuss the concept of Oracle Data Transfer Appliance.\nIn the next module we shall build our On-Prem Environment using Vagrant & VirtualBox , there will be a deep dive session into Vagrant if you are new to this technology as we will be installing, configuring Vagrant and then provision our Virtual Machine (VM) using Vagrant and show how this whole process is automated. This would be followed by the installation of Oracle 18c XE , creation of database along with Sample Schemas and this will act as our on-prem Oracle Database environment.\nOnce our On-Prem environment is all setup we will proceed our journey to oracle Cloud and will introduce you to 2 important concepts in OCI which are Compartments and VCN's (Virtual Cloud Network) and then we shall provision a VM based DbaaS Instance in OCI. I shall teach you the method to setup SSH connectivity between On-prem machine and OCI DB System.\nFrom next module onwards we will be delving deeper into different types of Oracle Database Migration methods which are available to us. The whole discussion will be divided into three parts : Discussion on the concept , Workflow of the Method , An End to End Demo on the migration method. Please note that the commands used in the demos are all given under the Resources section as well.  The Methods that will be taught are :\n•Data Pump Conventional Export/Import\n•Data Pump Transportable Tablespace\n•Data Pump Full Transportable\n•RMAN CONVERT Transportable Tablespace with Data Pump\n•RMAN Cross-Platform Transportable PDB\n•RMAN Cross-Platform Transportable PDB (Inconsistent Backups)\n•RMAN Restore using Oracle Cloud Backup Module\n•Unplugging/Plugging (CDB)\n•SQL Developer to Migrate Selected Objects\nAs with my all courses in the last Module we shall try and challenge ourselves and the challenge will be to Migrate the Oracle Database running in AWS RDS to Oracle Cloud and to accomplish this we shall be making use of AWS DMS (Data Migration Service).\nI hope at the end of the course you will feel more confident as you would be equipped with all the tools & techniques that you need to Migrated your on-prem oracle databases.\n\n\nHappy Learning !!!\n\n\nRegards\nKshitij Joy (OCM)\nDB Alchemist Academy",

      "description": "IP Video is a paradigm shift that will increase what is possible in all things live video. In this course, we will think outside the box about how to plan out live streaming and video production systems in the world of IP Video. Using standard networking infrastructure NDI will enable us to do more with less. We will uncover new possibilities for low budget streaming and high end video productions system alike as we move toward the future of broadcast video over IP.\nWe will capture low hanging fruit with the benefits of broadcast IP video and eliminate the need for capture cards in our next live streaming system design. Imagine an entire generation of video engineers who will never use expensive SDI cabling and capture devices. Using NDI we will have access to sources from all over our network and more. We no longer require all our sources to be directly connected to a single system. Capture cards are used for low latency video conversion from traditional HDMI or SDI video to USB or PCIe where we can use them with production software such as vMix, Wirecast, LiveStream and more. What if we could eliminate the need for capture cards altogether by providing the same quality, low latency video directly to Wirecast, vMix, Live Stream, OBS, or xSplit over the Ethernet connection we are already using.\nIn one fell swoop we have eliminated a point of failure from our video production workflow and reduced the cost of implementing a new system dramatically. At the end of the day we have opened up a whole new universe of possibilities where the network you already have has become the preferred method of video routing. Need another camera shot? Just run a single Cat-5 cable to the PTZOptics NDI camera and you will have high quality video, camera control and power solved in an instant.\nThis is where the rubber meets the road, in a world where every device can see every other device in a seamless video production workflow. Unlike SDI cabling, Ethernet can provide power for cameras using a PoE source, such as a switch, simplifying installation and eliminating the need for additional outlets. And unlike traditional RS-223 control cables, Ethernet can also be used to control our cameras within your favorite video production software or via one of our IP joysticks without requiring direct analog control cabling to each camera.\nNDI will make your transition to IP video simple. Want to add your PTZOptics camera from the Studio into a GoToMeeting call with your Producer across the world? No problem. Access it from any computer on your network using NDI transmit or the output of your software based video switcher like Wirecast or vMix. One of the most powerful features of NDI|HX is the ability to visualize any camera into a Virtual USB Webcam on your network from any Windows or Mac computer. Your favorite video production software will become much more powerful with access to all NDI sources on your network. Want to live stream with your Main PC and setup a secondary machine for isolated recordings of each camera? No problem. Download the free NDI Isocorder app from NewTek and get started. **NDI|HX Virtual Input\nAs you can see, we can start to envision new IP workflows leveraging free and professional IP video tools available from Newtek and over 100 other partner developers. Do you work with a creative team? They will love the free Adobe Creative Cloud plugin for NDI. Are you working on a budget? Tryout the free Open Broadcaster Software plugin for NDI or start out with low cost vMix HD license. The move toward IP video production will make the answer to your next live streaming challenge \"Sure, we can do that\".",

The first step is covering data science project management techniques and we follow CRISP-DM methodology with 6 steps below:\nBusiness Understanding : We cover the types of problems and business processes in real life\nData Understanding: We cover the data types and data problems. We also try to visualize data to discover.\nData Preprocessing: We cover the classical problems on data and also handling the problems like noisy or dirty data and missing values. Row or column filtering, data integration with concatenation and joins. We cover the data transformation such as discretization, normalization, or pivoting.\nMachine Learning: we cover the classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression or K-NN. We also cover prediction / regression algorithms like linear regression, polynomial regression or decision tree regression. We also cover unsupervised learning problems like clustering and association rule learning with k-means or hierarchical clustering, and a priori algorithms. Finally we cover ensemble techniques in Knime.\nEvaluation: In the final step of data science, we study the metrics of success via Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity for classification; purity , randindex for Clustering and  rmse, rmae, mse, mae for Regression / Prediction problems with Knime.\nBONUS CLASSES\nWe also have bonus classes for artificial neural network and deep learning on image processing problems.\nWarning: We are still building the course and it will take time to upload all the videos.

      "description": "Boost your career by learning how to turn your code into fully fledged Python packages that anyone around the world can pip install. In just one hour (or 30m with 2x speed), you'll have built your very first package.\nHi, I'm Dr. Justin Furuness, and I'm the right guy to teach this to you. My Python packages have hundreds of thousands of downloads, have been used by NIST (the US government agency for cybersecurity), have been published in peer-reviewed papers, and have been used by teams all around the world.\nBut don't just take my word for it. Here are some testimonials from just a few of the more than 10,000 people that have taken the course:\n\"The course content exceeded the expectations and details are to the point and crisp\" -Ezhilarasi\n\"Very very helpful and my doubts are blown away which were there until now\" -Sai\n\"This was great! I found it to be extremely helpful to get my bearings on the structure/process of a python package, and I'm excited to take this knowledge into my work.\" - Jamie\n\"Very much useful. Rarely I find this kind of work when the courses says advanced python but this is what I expect. Thanks for such great course. I wish if you can provide more such courses in future.\" - Amit\n\"Course was excellent\" -Harikrishna\n\"That course and the instructor are just great! Clear and to the point. Don't let the length of the course fool you : ) It is truly worth it\" - Moutasem\n\"Very good. Clearly a gifted programmer.\" -Matthew\n\"This is exactly what I needed, thanks!\" -Zukisa\n\"Great, organized work. Keep producing more courses like this.\" -Dr. Ahmed\n\"It's an amazing course\" -Mutra\n\"Great material, short and on point. I've liked the explanations and the clarity of the teacher. In the past I've installed some packages using different techniques but I needed some guidelines and best-practices with how structure a project, init files, main files ecc.\" -David\n\"To the point in a short time for a topic that I was struggling with for a long time.\" - Anonomous\n\"Nice and short, well explained. Recommend if this is a topic of interest to you.\" - Sean\n\"Excellent course, really appreciate that you got straight to the point and did not explain Python from scratch as many tutorials do. Those certainly have their place, but a quick course like this is definitely appreciated by someone who already knows the language!\" - Jacob\n\"Short and sweet, efficient, concise gets to the point and it's good to see it all in one pass - is good about being transparent about not being for beginners, nice for me who has spent a long time programming in python for myself, but just never really able to get accustomed to more properly packaging code for others to use.\" -Ambrew\n\"Excellent\" - Augustin\n\"Great course on python packaging. Short and with no minutia. I highly recommend it and wish the instructor had more courses.\" -Christina\n\"Really good course to the point and very current.\" - Patrick\n\"Detailed, succinct, and salient.\" - Bryce\n\"Thanks for the tutorial! It was very helpful. I am pretty sure I will come back to this course several times for references once I will want to create my own package.\" -Kamil\n\"I understood how to covert a python script to package in very nice and simple way. Thanks a lot.\" -Ranjan\n\"it was amazing, tnx\" -Hejar\n\"I know nothing about how to create packages in python, and so far the explanations in the course are easy to follow.\" - Marte\n\"Many useful information in these videos. Highly recommended if you want to dig into creating packages, and use pip. Thanks for creating this course!\" -Farkas\n\"That was such an informative, clearly explained course. I liked the briefness. It is one of the best content out there when we think about the course duration. Just 1-2 hours :) You will not be regretted. Thank you instructor !\" -Furkan\n\"Awesome instructor. Explains on the point in a very comfortable and efficient way. Well done! Also, the contend introduces some extra tricks and best practices that i did not expect when starting the course.\" -Julian\n\"Thank you for the good and organized explanations!! they were very relevant!! Keep up the good work ;)\" -Abderrahman\n\"great course. to the point. super useful. thanks :)\" - Avi\n\"Great course, exactly what I was looking for.\" -Jose\n\"Very useful advanced topics and easy to follow.\" -Martin\n\"Really great course, perfect pace and explanation for each step of the process. Great start for a new project I am working with.\" -Corinne\n\"Such a wonderful, practical and to the point content. Every bit of the course is so enriching. This is my first course on uploading a package to PyPi. Additionally, this is also helpful for people who have never done OOP in Python. We need more from Justin Furuness or more Justin-s in udemy sharing their real knowledge. Thank you Sir\" - Deepak\nBeyond build your Python packages, you'll be learning the difference between pyproject toml and setup py. What  MANIFEST in files are and how you'll use it in your own Python packages. When you should use absolute vs relative imports. How to version your package for every type of change. How to version dependencies, and install optional ones based on the environment. How to call your package from the command line. How to get those cool README badges. And so much more.\nThis field is constantly evolving, and I make sure this course evolves right along with it. I make sure to update this course any time new changes come out, which for Python packaging, is often. I've made sure to include the latest changes from PyPi around their new authentication scheme.\nYou're also getting access to myself and my help. Any questions feel free to message in the QnA and I'll be sure to respond. With a PhD, 10+ years of experience, and several popular Python packages with 100k+ downloads, you'll be getting top notch assistance.\nAs far as prerequisites go, this course is not for beginners. This is for strong python developers that are looking to take their skills to an advanced level. You should have a solid foundation in Python and have worked on at least a few Python projects of your own. You should know basic git/Github and terminal commands.\nThis course is specifically geared to college graduates, advanced developers who have just learned python and want to make their code ready for industry, and for Python developers who want to learn how to install their packages. Soon you'll be using Python packaging every day, wondering how you ever went without it.\nThese skills are highly useful and will no doubt impress any employer. This is widely regarded as the one of the hardest topics in Python, if not the hardest, so if you can do this you will be among a select few.\nAnd of course, this course has a 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee! So you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Please enroll now, and join me on this journey from zero to hero in Python packaging!",

The things that Mike taught are practical and can be applied in the real world immediately.\" -- Ricky V.\n\"This gives a deep diving scenario.\" -- Anish\nCOURSE INTRODUCTION\nThis course focuses on making SQL Server perform more optimally.\nIn my first course we laid the groundwork by tuning OUR instances with a top down approach.\nWE will continue on that path with this course.\nEven though the course has the word “Advanced\" in it, there's NOTHING COMPLICATED about taking what's in the course and applying it in the real word.\nIt's “advanced\" in that I'll take more time explaining how to implement these recommendations.\nThe course is still very much a \"buttons and Knobs\" course. This simply means WE won't dive too deeply into the minutia. We are still going to focus on items that are easily implemented. Some features will have a level of contention associated with them in the SQL Server community. It will be up to you decide to implement or not.\nAdditionally, some of the concepts may be new to even more senior level resources so I want to make sure I'll cover the why of the topic as well as the how.\nThis course will give YOU deeper insight into what it takes to become a skilled PERFORMANCE TUNER.  Once thought of as an art, performance tuning is nothing more than a series of processes that seek to accomplish TWO basic goals.\nThe FIRST one is to increase the response time for a given transaction or set of transactions.\nThe SECOND one is reduce resource consumption. On the surface this sounds simple but nothing could be further from the truth.\nTake the next step on YOUR performance tuning journey and SIGN UP now.",

That way you can keep up with the new information and not get overwhelmed.\n\n\nWe're touching on various applications of Dynamo and I believe this is the best way to learn - to see how a certain principle applies in different situations.\nI've been teaching that course in person for 20 hours. Here it is presented in 10 hours of video. You can pause, try out each step yourself and then continue.\nThe course is intense, but you're covered. You can ask questions here on Udemy or in our special Facebook group.\n\n\nNote!!!\nNow you can get a free license for the Nonica Tab plugin that allows you to run Dynamo graphs from dedicated buttons in Revit's ribbon menu.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the \"Azure Cloud Security with Microsoft Azure For Beginners\" course\nCloud security on Microsoft Azure, improve your cyber security skills with cloud security inside of Azure Cloud Security\nWhether you’re interested in preparing for an Azure exam, integrating Azure services into your existing business analytics practice, or executing machine learning with Azure, Oak Academy has a wide range of approachable courses to help you achieve your goals\n\nWhat is Microsoft Azure and what is it used for?\nMicrosoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform Through Azure, organizations can acquire Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service solutions (SaaS) Azure administrators can build, test, deploy, and manage their applications and services through Microsoft Azure, and they can access resources such as virtual computing, analytics, storage, and networking Microsoft Azure's largest competitor is Amazon Web Services, but Azure generally proves beneficial to those operating within a Microsoft ecosystem and using utilities such as Microsoft Office 365 As a cloud computing service, Microsoft Azure makes it easier for organizations to leverage and deploy large amounts of resources on-the-fly — paying only for the resources that are used and needed\n\nWhat are the certifications I can get with Microsoft Azure?\nThose who are interested in Microsoft Azure jobs may want to consider getting Microsoft Azure certifications There are a variety of certifications that can be acquired, including certifications directly from Microsoft Microsoft provides \"Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals,\" \"Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate,\" and \"Microsoft Certified: Azure for SAP Workloads Specialty\" certifications for those on an Azure career track There are additionally other certifications that you can acquire through organizations that provide boot camps and additional training for those interested in working with Azure These certifications range from entry-level certifications, which can help a professional get their foot in the door, to advanced, expert-level certifications that you can use to progress along a career path in the tech industry\n\nWho uses Azure?\nMany popular companies use Azure: eBay, Boeing, Samsung, and BMW are a few In terms of market share, Azure has been growing fast While it doesn't have as much of the market as AWS, it does have much more of the market than Google Cloud When it comes to Azure vs AWS, many companies choose Azure because they are already on a Microsoft architecture and feel that it is both intuitive and reliable Benefits of Azure over AWS include compatibility with NET, robust security offerings, hybrid solutions for on-premise connectivity, and Microsoft's Enterprise Agreement (which provides superior support) However, there are benefits to AWS as well, and there are many professionals who can transition smoothly between both Azure and AWS environments\nCloud computing is now one of the trending technologies and our future will be shaped by cloud computing\nThe widespread use of cloud services by individuals and the move of many companies' data centers and on-premises servers to the Cloud increases the importance of securing data in the cloud As companies move their IT assets to the public cloud, security will still be one of the main concerns for this transition\n\nIn the traditional IT approach, the security of IT assets is the responsibility of the information security or Infrastructure team in the company, but security in the cloud is not only the responsibility of the security team of the companies due to the overlapping roles\n\nWith the introduction of Cloud Architecture, the infrastructure team that builds and maintains the servers, as well as the software team that develops the applications on these servers, therefore the DevOps team is equally responsible for cloud security In a cloud shared responsibility model, organizations are still responsible for security in the cloud -- including their data -- while cloud providers are only responsible for the security of the cloud\n\nIn this course you’ll learn the fundamentals of cloud computing, as well as how to secure your infrastructure on Microsoft Azure Cloud computing services\n\nThis course includes theoretical lessons and hands-on demos to help you gain practical experience in Cloud Security on Microsoft Azure\nAt the end of the course you will learn;\nWhat is the Cloud?\nWhat are the three models of cloud service?\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\nWhat are the differences between:\nPublic Cloud vs Private Cloud vs Hybrid Cloud?\nWhat are the responsibilities of Cloud Service Providers?\nWhat is the shared responsibility model?\nHow can we define the security scope of Cloud Computing?\nWhat are the Cloud Security Frameworks?\nSANS\nCloud Security Alliance\nNIST\nWhat are Cloud Threats?\nHow to manage Identity and Access in the Azure portal\nHow to configure security services?\nHow to manage Azure Cloud Security Operations?\nHow to configure Azure Key management?\nHow to configure Azure PIM?\nHow to configure Azure Role Based Access Control - RBAC?\nHow to set up Multi-Factor

With this in mindset, you are going to learn the following concepts in Mulesoft: -\n\n\nModule 101 talks about basic on the Mulesoft which are:-\nMarrying the Anypoint Studio and Platform\nMulesoft Dependencies\nThe folder structure and some of the important links\nThe next Module, 102 the content we deal with includes:-\nHTTP Invocation and invoking some of the external API\nDealing with HTTP Query parameters and URI Parameters and some of the various HTTP Methods that we use in day to day IT life\nAs we progress a little bit further, then we start dealing with Database and Mulesoft Structures like:-\nInstallation and Configuration of Oracle and MySQL database\nHow to make use of the database component in anypoint studio and playing around with various set of database operations\nExecuting the Queries(SQL and MySQL)\nHow to create a variable, set a variable\nUnderstanding MEL\nSending HTTP Response back to the calling service & HTTP Overriding\nDebugging in Anypoint Studio\nAs we get along with the above said concepts then we start narrowing down to the concepts like:-\nDataweave, a powerful data transformation. The dataweave itself is divided into 4 modules and it talks about\nOperators\nSelectors\nDataTypes\nArrays, Objects, Strings\nCoercions, Casting, Numbers, XML\nHigher Order Functions & Functions\nFunctional Programming\nLambda expression\nAnonymous function\nPattern Matching\nError handling\nCore Module and more. A complete treat for dataweave lovers\nDatabase and error handling which includes:-\nDatabase operations\nOnerrorContinue, OnerrorPropagate, Sub flows and flows\nRaise error and error handler\nAs we further progress in our course we start to see the following modules like:-\nActiveMQ\nInstallation of ActiveMQ\nPublish & Subscribe Data\nJMS Concepts\nQueues and Topic\nRequest Reply\nAcknowledgement Mode\nObject Store, Water Marking and Batch Processing\nSecurity and Deployment\nCreation of YAML file\nSecuring yaml and properties file\nExternalizing the properties file\nDeployment to cloudhub\nMulesoft Components\nScatter Gather\nFor each\nParallel Foreach\nHTTP Request\nCaching\nAsync\nChoice\nUntil Successful, File connector\nRound Robin and First Successful\nOnce we gained the above knowledge, our depth for mulesoft has increased more. With these we will start to learn on more powerful concepts like: -\nMunit\nQuery Parameters & Assert That\nAssert That, Assert Expression, Maven, Folder Path, Extract Report and What is Munit\nMock when, HTTP Error handle and ReadURL\nHandle HTTP Error, Spy Call, Externalize Dataweave,  Parametrized - Set Parameters\nList of flows, Munit Recorder, Before and After Scopes\nRAML\nCreate Sample Spec, Publish and Download To Studio\nDefine QueryParameter and uriParamter | Define Request and Response\nTypes & Examples | Create Example within DataType\nRecourseTypes\nTraits\nLibrary\nAdding Module Dependencies\nCICD\nUsage of Maven\nGit & Visual Studio\nJenkins\nNexus\nSonarQube\nPolicies\nAuto Discovery\nProxy Endpoint\nBasic End Point & JSON Threat Protection\nClient ID and Client Sec - QueryParams & Headers - How to share the API to other users\nClientID Enforce Basic Authentication & Public Portal Request Access\nMessage Logging, Header Injection and Removal\nRate Limiting - Policy Order\nRate Limit SLA\nHTTP Caching\nCustom Policy - Maven Archetype & Automated Policies\nAlong with the above said concepts we also deal with:-\nSalesforce integration with Mulesoft\nWeb Service SOAP/XML\nAbout Maven\nUsage of Anypoint Platform\nUsage of Python, Java Module and Groovy within Anypoint Studio\nAs mentioned earlier, this is an extensive course work on Mulesoft. As rest assured, there are more modules to be added as we get along with the mulesoft journey. I wish you all a very best in your Mulesoft Journey.",

Azure DevOps is a single platform that helps by utilizing the Agile process which means you can perform a combination of development and operation processes for software development. It provides an end-to-end DevOps toolchain for developing and deploying software.\nMost companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.\nAzure Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build, test, and deploy your code project. It is a fully-featured continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) service.  Before you use continuous integration and continuous delivery practices for your applications, you must have your source code in a version control system. Azure Pipelines integrates with GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Azure Repos Git & TFVC and Bitbucket Cloud.  You can automate the build, testing, and deployment of your code to Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or Amazon Web Services or On-Premise also.  You can use many languages with Azure Pipelines, such as Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C#, C++, and Go.  Use Azure Pipelines to deploy your code to multiple targets. Targets include container registries, virtual machines, Azure services, or any on-premises or cloud target.\n\n\nContinuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time CD by itself is a set of processes, tools, and techniques that enable rapid, reliable, and continuous delivery of software. So, CD isn't only about setting up a pipeline, although that part is important.\n\n\nThis tutorial is just one module from my complete Azure DevOps training on portal named Bestdotnettraining (Deccansoft)",

      "description": "Its FREE now, please check coupons.\nSystem design interviews are very common in big software firms. They are different from coding interviews or data structure and algorithm interviews but can be harder. They require a broad set of knowledge. Almost all the top software companies, be it google, amazon, uber have one or two rounds of system design interviews. After clearing the data structures and algorithm interviews if you do well in these system design interviews you can expect a very good offer from these firms.\nThis is a course to help students to prepare for system design interviews. Using this you will learn system design by seeing demos, building software, understanding complex topics.  It is both a theory and code along course with real world case studies and demos to give you in-depth knowledge rather than learning few case studies that might or might not come in an interview.\nIt is an actively developed course with the aim to impart correct and good knowledge on building large scale systems. Aim is to get the student ready for a system design interview even when they have not faced a similar case study before.\nSome sample questions for system design interviews :\n1. How would you go about designing an e-commerce website at scale ?\n2. How would you go about designing the e-commerce website using microservices, how will you handle transactions ?\n3. Design a chat messenger application like any famous chat messenger you have used ?\n4. Create an autocomplete feature like word suggestions on search engines ? Scale it to millions of users ?\n5. How would you go about creating a feed postings in a social network ? ( - Similar Patient Feed in Course with Code)\n6. How would you build a large scale machine learning backend system to generate video recommendations like on Netflix ?\n7. How would you build a mobile app to track your day to day health, exercise routine and sleep patterns and give you recommendations based on the stats recorded ?\n8. How would you build your own CDN ?\nTOP REVIEWS :\n\nSid Hicks\nRating: 5.0 out of 55 months ago\nThe amount of information delivered in this course is amazing. Thank you for organizing into chunks. This makes it easy to understand. Well Done!\n\nRohit Dhawan\nRating: 4.5 out of 58 months ago\nI also went through the grokking the system design, which is mostly a reading material and the steps are the same as the ones covered here. For max bang of bucks, learning and understanding, I liked this one over the other one.\n\n\nKarthik Chinni\nRating: 5.0 out of 53 months ago\nI agree that the sound quality was not good in a few places. But, content delivered is really great. Was upto the point and crisp. Keep the good work going on. Cheers.\n\n\n\nAbhishek Aman\nRating: 5.0 out of 56 months ago\nYes, it was really good. Could you please create more content on system design which includes more of scenario based designing rather than going behind a use case. So when I say scenario based, I mean we choose this component if the we want to serve 1m users from one box. Something of this sort.\nI might sound very noob as I am stillnew to system design and learning pretty fast, but yes please take note of my request.\n\n\nMonimoy Deb Purkayastha\nRating: 5.0 out of 55 months ago\nI have learnt lot of system design approaches and case studies. This is very useful an well structured course\n\n\nAhlem Mustapha\nRating: 5.0 out of 55 months ago\nIt is a good course for anyone who has no prior knowledge about system design and who wants to start by knowing the big pictures , later in chapters there is different explanations and concepts to know. I also liked the different suggestions about the materials and resources that someone can use in order to learn more about the topic. a suggestion to add subtitles and scripts to your videos !! :)\nthank you a lot\nadvice for improvement is: improve the voice sometimes there is echo , also write a script so people could follow with you while talking. overall thanks a lot I am halfway the course and it is so great so far",

This course will take you all the way from \"what is a button\" to model view controller programming. Includes full source code available on GitHub, and includes an entire section of example applications. This course overs Qt 5. Because Qt 6 has so many changes, I will re-record these lessons using Qt 6 and place them into a different course.\n\n\nNo experience with QML necessary, this is a beginners course that will teach you the foundations Widgets cross platform development. Widgets run on most major desktops (windows, mac, linux).\n\n\nWe will start with a short introduction to Widgets, and then rapidly move on to more complex topics.\n\n\nThis course is specifically designed for Qt 5 with beginner in mind but as I mentioned, most of this is comptatible with Qt6. These videos take you from knowing nothing about Qt Widgets to creating intermediate level applications using C++. These videos build on the popular Qt Core series available on Udemy. These videos show many best practices and how to overcome common mistakes. About the author: Bryan has created  hundreds of Qt tutorials available on YouTube and has created official Qt training videos for the Qt Company. Full source code available on GitHub, and runs a Facebook community with thousands of developers that can offer free help 24x7.\n\n\nHighly recommended that you have a strong foundation in Qt Core before attempting this course - fear not, I have other courses available on Udemy:\n\n\nQt 5 Core Beginners\nQt 5 Core Intermediate\nQt 5 Core Advanced",

Thanks!” Jef Yo\n“This short course is excellent and will give you a good understanding of the basics in SQL server administration.” Luke Dunn\nIn this course we are going to delve into the Query Optimizer, easily one of the most complicated pieces of software ever written.\nThe Query Optimizer is the SQL Server component that tries to give you an optimal execution plan for your queries. The Query Optimizer tries to find that execution plan as quickly as possible. Not the perfect plan but a good one.\nThe SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer. It analyzes a number of execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and chooses the plan with the lowest cost.\nThe optimizer seeks to find balance between the optimization time and the quality of the selected plan.\nThe course will be a balance of hands on query performance tuning and understanding the basics of the optimizer’s architecture.\nWe are going to learn about the execution engine, statistics and cost estimation, index selection and the optimization process.\nAt the core of the SQL Server Database Engine are two major components: the storage engine and the query processor also called the relational engine.\nIn this course our sole focus will be on the query processor. This part of the engine accepts all queries submitted to SQL Server and creates a plan for optimal execution.\nSee you in the course!!!",

If implemented incorrectly, they can wreak havoc.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE?\nLearn the basic concepts behind data bits and bytes, data storage devices, compression and data management.\nBits & Bytes\nStorage Media\nCompression\nDatabases\nData Management\nCentralized vs Distributed Architecture\nThis course includes:\nVideo lectures walking you through the various aspects of wireless\nQuiz to test your retention\nSignificant number of resources to do a deeper dive into this topic.\nWHO IS THE IDEAL STUDENT FOR THIS COURSE?\nYou will learn a lot from this course if you are\nThinking about choosing healthcare as a career\nLooking to advance your career in healthcare\nLooking to expand your knowledge of healthcare to better perform your current job and better understand how it fits into the ecosystem of patient care and better serve those in need\nCurious about everything and want to learn more about healthcare just for the sake of expanding your knowledge base.\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING STYLE?\nMy teaching style is a very pragmatic one. I assume you know nothing about this topic and start with the foundation and build from there. Some of these concepts could be challenging, so I sprinkle in as many examples as I can, both non healthcare and healthcare, to assure full understanding of the topic. This is why I have appended \"Plain and Simple\" to all my courses.\nWHY ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE?\nI spent 35 years in the designing and launching of medical imaging products and services. My career evolved from leading engineering teams, to becoming VP Marketing and then to president of a Healthcare IT firm. It is also based on 15 years of university teaching.",

Next would be Compute node patching and what happens behind the scenes, discussion around the powerful utility dbnodeupdate. The Exadata database server patching including GI + DB will be discussed and also the significance of patches like SPU/PSU/BP/DBBP. The Infiniband patching will be discussed to tell the audience how the firmware for the switches are patched.\nAt the end a case study will be presented to show how the Complete Stack upgrade was done from Exadata 12.1 to Exadata 12.2.1.1.0.",

The eBook in pdf version can be downloaded (at no additional cost) from \"Getting Started with python\" video lecture.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCourse Description\n\nEver since the dawn of computers, businesses have been attempting to automate processes. With the advent of RPA in the recent past, this automation game has moved to a higher trajectory.\n\nWhat is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation refers to specialized software programs also known as software robots. These specialized software programs are entrusted with 'doing' iterative and mundane tasks that otherwise would be done by humans in front of the computer. It imitates human actions and acts which does the work required without any breaks. An advantage of having such software to this kind of work is that it reduces the probability of human error and increases productivity significantly\nAs the task gets more complicated, software is equipped with more cognitive technologies. These include machine learning, speech recognition and natural language processing. Also known as digital workers, these software and systems are very reliable and efficient in performing the task allotted despite the level of skill required.\nCurrent State of the market and Why Python for RPA?\nMarket is currently flooded with multiple tools to do these kind of automation. At the same time, there are multiple instances of automation initiatives failing that has made businesses wary. The key reason is that processes are not standardized. That is where an automation project done in Python can be a game changer because automating in python provides the much needed flexibility that is needed for the real world.\nRPA using Python\nThis course covers the concepts, python programming and automation programming comprehensively so you are ready for the real world challenges. Course uses Google colab as the development environment - you learn to code in a cloud environment but also to access data stored in cloud.",

Checking to the top 1000 queries it’s usually not worth your time to optimize.\nHow to find the relevant information out of the plethora of performance views and metrics available in MySQL\nUnderstand why UPDATE and DELETE statements are also reads even though they are primarily write statements. This will have an impact on I/O, and therefore to the response time.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Queries\nUnderstand why MySQL creates a query plan, before each query request\nHow to read query plans, and understand how each of the underlying node types works on MySQL\nA series of examples, to show how the EXPLAIN output can be used, to identify where MySQL spends time on your query, and why\nWhich are the important pieces of information, to look for in order to spot performance issues\n\n\nThe Clustered Index and Choosing the Primary Key\nWhen we work with index-organized tables, as the ones in MySQL, the choice of the primary index, is very important.\nWe'll see how the primary key, can impact the amount of random, or sequential I/O, the size of secondary indexes, and how many pages need to be read into the buffer pool.\nWe're going to understand, why an optimal primary key, with respect to the clustered index, is as small (in bytes) as possible, keeps increasing monotonically, and groups the rows we query frequently, and within a short distance of each other.\n\n\nIndexing for performance\nWhich are the main function of an index?\nWe'll see exactly which tables are in need for an index, and which tables are better without one.\nWe'll check how MySQL relies on statistics to choose the best index, and how we can help it to make better decisions.\n\n\nComposite Indexes\nCommon mistakes of composite indexes\nHow to decide the order of columns for multicolumn indexes\nBe able to reason through how indexes work, and to choose them based on that understanding, not on rules of thumb\nWhich are the use-cases, that make Redundant Indexes useful, and when to avoid them.\nWork on some benchmarks, to check the actual performance in numbers.\n\n\nMySQL Server Configurations\nCheck how we should approach MySQL configuration changes by considering some best practices, so that we can successfully tune MySQL.\nWhich are the three options that MySQL is most likely to benefit, from non-default values, and also how to set them.\nGo through an overview of the data lifecycle in InnoDB, so that we have background knowledge when making configuration changes.\nAdjust parameters that are important for certain use-cases, for example, buffer pool instances for high concurrent workloads, and how to make use of parallel execution for certain queries.\n\n\nMySQL Transactions and Locks\nTransactions are very important to ensure data integrity but when used wrong they can cause severe performance issues.\nGet an overview of why locks are needed and some ways to reduce their impact.\nHow indexes, splitting the transaction and the isolation levels can help to reduce the number of locks\nMonitoring options and what reporting tables to check to spot lock problems.\n\n\nIntroduction to Scaling MySQL\nWhat it means to scale MySQL and, we'll walk through the different axes where we may need to scale.\nUnderstand how to scale different kinds of loads\nReplication and why we need to make use of Read-Pools, Health Checks, and Service Discovery\nWhich are the main concerns and pitfalls when deciding to Shard the database\nHow to partition data in MySQL\nWhich are the use-cases and advantages for using a Queue\nFundamental Concepts for Scaling Writes with Sharding",

I think these courses would be great for anyone new to SQL Server. I imagine this would be great preparation for those thinking about getting an MS SQL Server certification too.\" -- Keith B\n\"The explanation was very simple and easy to understand.\" -- Mansoor\n\n\nCOURSE OVERVIEW\nSQL Server is a combination of two core items The first is the administration side of the house. Creating databases, managing logins and users, backups,… etc.\nThe second part of the equation is that of developing code in a language called Structured Query Language.\nMicrosoft’s flavor of SQL is called Transact-SQL.\nTransact was designed primarily to work with relational databases. Transact is the language used to talk to SQL Server.\nWhen we want to create a database a database we use DDL or Data Definition Language. I’m defining an object when I use the statement with the code.\nWhen we want to see data inside a table we use DML or Data Manipulation Language. I’m not creating an object I’m manipulating the data inside that object.\nIn this course we are going to learn the basics of Transact-SQL or T-SQL.\nWe will cover the fundamentals of Transact using real world examples. Additionally, we will discuss some of the best practices associated with crafting clean, high performance code.\nYou’ll learn why stored procedures are so important to well-designed applications and why ad hoc queries aren’t.\nThe knowledge you gain from the course will not only help you learn to develop but will also give you a great first step to learning how to pinpoint performance issues due to poorly written code.\nThanks for your interest in “Real World Transact-SQL from the Ground Up.”\nSee you in the course.",

      "description": "Why this course?\nIn this course we are going to learn about Apigee Management Platform. Apigee is a product from Google and has a very good market share in the API Management market. It currently being used by big companies like Adobe, Accenture, Citrix, Dell, ebay, and many more. That’s why learning about Apigee is definitely going to boost your career and job opportunities.\nThere are other courses and information available on internet which teach concepts in isolation. They basically do small POCs (Proof Of Concepts) to showcase various things. But they do not give you a project scenario and show how different things tie up together.\nIn this course is not a POC course we learn concepts by doing hands-on project and code it ourselves. This will give a enhanced learning platform on top of the theoretical concepts which I have covered in great detail. I have taken a very easy to understand approach, and I will take you through a flow which will make learning each and every concept very interesting.\nPlease also note that this course has lot of quizzes to test your learning!!\nWhat you will learn?\nYou will be learning the following in this course:\nWe will start with an introduction to APIs in general and REST APIs.\nThen we will look at why API Management is so crucial for businesses these days.\nAfter that I will discuss about the REST API which we will be using for this course.\nThen we start exploring about Apigee. We will start with creating an account in Apigee and then expose our API through Apigee.\nWe will then dive into some basic concepts of Apigee like Developers, Products and Apps. We will also look at Post and Pre Flows and message processing in these flows.\nWe will look at some of the debugging options available in Apigee like Tracing sessions.\nWe will also explore different kinds of policies on Apigee and how we can use them.\nThen will explore a very basic features of Apigee called Key-Value maps\nWe will also look at sharing flows between API Proxies using Shared Flows\nLearn about caching in Apigee\nLearn how to use Message Logging to log messages\nThen we move on to API security features on Apigee like API Keys, Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0.\nWe will also look at some of the API Analytics capabilities and Reports available from Apigee.\nIn this course I have explained OAuth 2.0 in great detail and with real-time example and use.\nWe are going to cover lot of details in this course. So we have lot of theory to learn and lot hands-on exercises to do.\nSee you in the lectures!\nThanks and all the best!!",

If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software.\n\n\nHello and welcome to my new course The Dummies guide to Practical Quantum Computing with IBM Qiskit. Our current classical computing technology is based on bits or binary digits 1 and 0 . 1 for ON and 0 OFF. Even though it have two states, a bit can exist in only one state at a time. Just like a coin having two faces head and tail.\nNOTE: In classical computers a programmer can simply WRITE HIGH LEVEL CODE AND RUN it. But for Quantum Computers we have to DESIGN CIRCUITS for performing specific tasks.\nQuantum computing concept is entirely different from classical one. It use the quantum mechanical property of tiny sub atomic particles like electrons to perform computation. Instead of 1 and 0, a qubit or quantum bit uses the spin position 'up' and 'down' of electrons.\n\n\nBut unlike bits, qubits can exist in both state simultaneously. Like a coin keeps on spinning, we could say it is having equal probability for both head and tail. Or it is both head and tail at the same time.\n\n\nFor example consider an 1 bit calculation of finding the best path. 0 means right and 1 means left. A classical computer with a single bit have to first set bit to 0 to go to left path and later 1 to go to right path to find the best path. But a quantum computer with a single qubit can go through both the path simultaneously and arrive at a solution in just only half the time.\n\n\nAs the number of qubits increases, this speed increases exponentially compared to classical computers. Computations like data analytic, artificial intelligence which require large parallel processing ability can perform calculations in matter of milli-seconds where it now takes ages to complete.\n\n\nEven though its not going to replace our laptops or mobile phones, Quantum computers will be able to solve these road blocks of traditional computers in data processing. Recently Google announced it has a quantum computer that is 100 million times faster than any classical computer in its lab.\n\n\nThe first section of our course from sessions 1 to 6, we are learning essential details about quantum mechanics, and quantum bits which will start with an introduction to quantum mechanics. We will try to have a quick understanding about the difference between quantum mechanics and classical physics, dual nature of particles, double slit experiment, superposition, quantum entanglement etc in the most simplest way of explanation.\n\n\nIn the next session we will discuss about the difference between classical bits and quantum bits called qubits. Creating, representing and processing a classical bit. Then how a qubit is generated, what's inside the qubit, how data is represented in qubit and what makes it faster than classical bits.\n\n\nThen we will see in details how a qubit is created and how its retaining its information. We will also discuss the structure of a quantum computer and the way qubits are dealt within it.\n\n\nThen we will learn about scalars and vectors. How vectors and matrices are used to represent the state of a quantum bit. About representing the qubit as Ket vectors and matrices. We will also learn basic matrix operations.\n\n\nAfter learning about classical bits and qubits, we can now proceed with gates. At first we will learn about classical gates, its working and also different types of classical gates and their truth tables.\n\n\nIn the next session, we will learn about the popular quantum frameworks by leading companies researching on quantum computers, their merits and demerits.\n\n\nHaving all concepts clear, now we can proceed with the practical part of our course. We will at first setup our computer by installing python environment. Its made easy by installing python distribution called anaconda. Then we will proceed with installing and testing qiskit, the quantum framework by IBM\n\n\nOnce we have qiskit in our computer and the quantum simulator running, we will be coding our first quantum circuit using the simple quantum gate called the Pauli x gate. Later we will try customizing the input and output to the Pauli x gate and verify the operations.\n\n\nOnce we verified in simulator, its time we can try that in a real quantum computer. IBM provides access to their number of quantum computers located in research facilities around the world. Using IBM quantum experience interface we can simply create our Pauli x gate circuit to work in a real quantum computer and get output.\n\n\nThen we will check how we can represent matrices as state vectors using dirac notation. We will see how Pauli x gate matrices will be represented as a state vector.\n\n\nSimilarly we will proceed with Pauli Y gate. We will check the state vector and try with the operations in our qiskit simulator at first and then implement it in the IBM real quantum computer.\n\n\nLike that, another gate called the Pauli Z gate. For this one also we will learn about the operations in our qiskit simulator at first and then implement it in real quantum computer.\n\n\nIn the next session, we will learn about the Eigen value and Eigen vectors of our already learnt Pauli x, y and z gates.\n\n\nAfter that, we will learn about a new gate called as the Hadamard gate or the H gate. This gate is capable of generating superposition from a classical qubit. We will have an introduction about the operations of H gate. Then we will implement the H gate in our qiskit simulator. We will check the bloch sphere and histogram representation using qiskit.\n\n\nUsing H gate we will also try creating few custom circuits in which we will try to replicate an X gate operations only using the H and Z gates. In the next circuit we will\ncheck the phenomenon of collapsing the superposition when we measure the qubit.\nThen we will try the Hadamard gate in an IBM quantum computer.\n\n\nAfter H gate we will take few quick sessions dealing with few more gates. The first one called as the R Phi gate. Then we will check two more gates called as the S and T gates. And finally will deal with the U and I gates. We will check the transition matrix and operations of those gates.\n\n\nThose were gates with single qubit operations. Now we will proceed with gates that are capable of multi-qubit operations. Before that, we will learn about representing multi-qubits and its states. We will be using a package called qiskit-notebook for representing the multi-qiskit state vector.\n\n\nAt first we will try to create a multi-qubit circuit using single qubit gates. At first we will try with X and H gates combined to form the circuit. And later we will try using two qubits and a single gate.\n\n\nAfter that we will proceed with a real multi-qubit gate called as CNOT gate or the Controlled NOT gate. We will learn more about CNOT gate, the truth table and its operations. At first we will try the CNOT gate with classical qubits. We will implement it in qiskit. Later we will try the CNOT gate with only one superposition qubit and after that with both superposition qubits.\n\n\nThen we will proceed with implementing CNOT gate in the Real quantum computer from IBM.\n\n\nWe can also create identity circuits using CNOT gate. Using these equivalence circuit we can mimic operations of other gates which cannot be performed in a real quantum computer.\n\n\nAt first we will create an identity circuit using a CNOT gate wrapped with H gates so that it will act like a CNOT gate placed in opposite direction.\n\n\nThen we will try another equivalence circuit using a CNOT gate in between Hadamard gates which will generate operations of a Controlled Z gate or CZ gate.\n\n\nLike that we will create an equivalence circuit for another theoretical gate called as the CY gate or the Controlled Y gate.\n\n\nThere is another gate called as the SWAP gate. Like the name indicates, it can swap the qubit states between each other. We will also create circuit identity or circuit equivalence for swap gate.\n\n\nSimilarly for another gate called the Tiffoli gate, we will create circuit identity or circuit equivalence for tiffoli gate and we will implement that circuit in qiskit.\n\n\nAnd that's all with gates, we will now proceed with learning an important algorithm called as the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm or DJ algorithm which demonstrates quantum parallelism.\n\n\nThe underlying mathematics of this algorithm is very complex and we are just trying learn it in just a very shallow manner. At first we will see the DJ problem that the algorithm is dealing with and later we will learn about the algorithm design. We will implement it in qiskit later and will verify the results.\n\n\nWe will then proceed with discussing about two interesting technologies.\n\n\nThe first one called as QKD or Quantum key distribution which utilizes the unique properties of quantum  systems to generate and distribute cryptographic key. Quantum cryptography also uses the same physics principles to communicate virtually non-hackable data over a dedicated communications link.\n\n\nThen we will discuss about Quantum tele-portation which is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away.\n\n\nOverall this will be a nice course for a beginner who are fascinated about quantum computing and want to learn more about quantum computing. Actual quantum computing is all about complex boring mathematics and formulas which I have tried my maximum to avoid convert it in a very simple way to make it understandable to a beginner.\n\n\nIn this course we are strictly following the IBM Qiskit documentation and text book. Almost all of the illustrations and examples used in this course are from the IBM qiskit documentation website which you may refer for further learning from this point.\n\n\nQuantum computers could help the development of new breakthroughs in science, medications, machine learning, material science, finance which helps mankind to become the best civilization in the whole universe. In fact quantum computer is so powerful that no one knows how to use its true potential and till now no quantum algorithm is perfect. The hardware and code are still in its development stage providing great opportunities in future for quantum computing professionals.\n\n\nThat's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, and jupyter notebook files used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.\n\n\nAlso after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.\n\n\nSo that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.\n\n\nReferences and Credits:\nIBM's qiskit  learn\nIBM's qiskit textbook\nIBM's qiskit documentation\nblog cloudflare - the-quantum-menace\ntowardsdatascience demystifying quantum gates one qubit at a time 54404ed80640\nwikipedia - Quantum_logic_gate\njonathan-hui qc quantum computing series 10ddd7977abd\nyoutube - Coding with Qiskit\nyoutube - Veritasium, a much simplified explanation to every complex quantum concepts\nVery much inspired by works and articles of Professor Andrea Morello.

Want to learn the building blocks of how organisations across various sectors like IT, Manufacturing, Mass Media, Financial Services, Pharmaceutical and many more, are tearing down data silos to build self-descriptive datasets and drive next-level AI and analytics?\nYou've landed at the right spot! This course is about the Resource Description Framework or RDF for short, and SPARQL, which are two fundamental layers of the Semantic Web Stack for building knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are essentially datasets that are richly described and explicitly linked as networks. RDF is a simple data model for capturing these rich networks, and SPARQL is the query language for interrogating knowledge graphs that are expressed in RDF format.\nWhile we are in the Information Age and technologies like relational databases (e.g. SQL) are old but not obsolete, and surely here to stay for many more years to come, organisations are quickly realising that their datasets need to be weaved together efficiently within the data value stream. This requires us to capture and describe data as networks and building a consolidated picture of our data resources, enabling us to answer key business questions more smartly, intuitively and at scale.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to work with RDF and SPARQL from a practical perspective. We're going to roll up our sleeves and dive into authoring RDF graphs in the Turtle and TriG formats, which are common human-friendly text formats for writing RDF data. We're going spend a great deal of time working with SPARQL and there will be loads of useful examples and problems we'll go through and solve along the way.\nThis course is for people who care about data representation, data architecture and data engineering.",

      "description": "Finding tickets in Atlassian's Jira ticketing systems (Jira Software or JIra Service Management) can be frustrating. But it doesn't have to be!\nThis course is built for students of all skill levels, from completely new beginners to Jira to seasoned veterans, and for any type of job including Project Managers, developers, support desk agents and more. It applies to ANY version of Jira, including Cloud, Service Management, Data Center, Server, Software, Work Management and more.\nThis course includes a lot of hands-on learning opportunities by using your own free Jira instance. This will let you easily follow along and experiment with your own searching.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nThis course covers background information about searching in Jira, including topics like filter permissions and ticket visibility. Additional features, like subscriptions are discussed to help make your saved searches even more useful for your team. I’ll even teach your some tricks to quickly share searches without having to save them.\nNext you learn about the basic search feature, which (despite the name) is a great way to quickly search for, and find tickets. You’ll learn how to add or remove fields from your search and change which columns of data are visible.\nWhile basic search is powerful, it does have its limitations, which is where Jira Query Language, or JQL comes in. You’ll learn how to use this powerful tool to find tickets based on almost any criteria. You’ll learn how to use Jira's operators, like greater than, less than and more. We’ll cover JQL’s keywords, like “IN”, “AND” and “OR”, and walk through live examples of using them all. You’ll learn how to search for text, and why it’s different than other fields, as well as how to use dates in JQL.\nJQL also has a number of functions to help make your searching easier. We'll cover a range of functions, including ones that will help you find tickets based on SLA status, manage tickets in sprints and more.\nLast, we’ll cover Jira dashboards, and how they help you visualize your search results. We’ll look at common gadgets, dashboard layouts and sharing dashboards with your team.\nThroughout the course you’ll test your knowledge with some quizzes. These are designed to get you thinking through how to solve common requests in search, and to better understand how it all comes together.\n\n\nWhy should you take this course?\nAvoid frustration - Being able to easily find tickets will remove a LOT of frustration from your Jira experience.\nEasily find relevant tickets - Using JQL will make it significantly easier to locate specific tickets, speeding up your overall process.\nShare information - Dashboards and saved filters will help you easily share information with your team\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nSoftware Engineers - Engineers will benefit by being able to quickly track down tickets they are responsible for, or find critical information more quickly.\nProject Managers / Scrum Masters - PM's benefit by being able to quickly sort and find tickets to provide updates, manage incoming work and share information.\nProduct Owners - PO's will learn how to quickly, and easily, locate specific tickets so they can more effectively manage their backlog.\nSupport Agents - Locating similar tickets easily will help answer incoming requests, and being able to reference others work speeds up solving issues.\nAnalysts - Pulling up historic tickets to identify trends and research is very beneficial.\nAnyone else who uses Jira - Everyone using Jira can benefit from understanding how searching works.\nI’m looking forward to seeing you in the course, and happy Jira-ing!",

      "description": "~~ Jan 2022 Update • Start the year right! ~~\nThere's a new section, \"TL;DR - Diving in & creating one skill\", that will help you get started with Skill Building using the latest Amazon Alexa Developer Console interface. You will build a \"Zodiac Finder\" skill that will help you learn several voice interaction concepts - such as Invocation Name, Intents & Slots (both Built-in & Custom), Slot Values, Interaction Model, Skill Logic, Debugging, Setting Lambda Endpoints, and using Multiple Languages. Finally, you will test the skill on the browser-based Alexa Simulator, the Alexa App and an Amazon Echo device.\n\n\n•••\n\n\nGet Meta & Practical Knowledge on Building Voice Interfaces (VUIs) / Conversational Interfaces\nSuitable for Beginners & Power Users\nDevelopers\nProject Managers\nMarketer\nCourse Highlights\nGet an understanding of Lambda, Lex, Polly, S3 & more\nUtilize Alexa Skills Kit v2 using Node.js 10.x\nBuild an Introductory Skill (for Reading out Quotes)\nCreate an Advanced Skill using Third Party APIs (Google Maps)\nGet the fundamental understanding of how all pieces fit together and how a Virtual Personal Assistant works\n--\nWhy this course?\nThere is a shift happening in the way we as a species communicate with machines. With the advent of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana, the focus on Voice User Interfaces or Voice Activated Conversational Interfaces is rapidly increasing.\nThis ever changing world presents a threat to the way we operate, especially when we do not understand it. A more AI aware world might be years away, but if we learn how to talk to and control the machines then we grow collectively.\n--\nThe \"Real\" Goal for this course\nYes, Amazon Alexa and similar voice activated interfaces look and sound pretty cool. You can use the extensive documentation available with each interface to build out the skills.\nHowever, just learning the syntax of a particular system is not enough. To mature as an individual, you need to gain the foundational skills on how these interfaces operate, and be technology agnostic when it comes to building these conversational interfaces.\nThe real goal of this course is to get you competent enough to understand the complexities that go behind designing and creating the voice user interfaces, so that you can immediately assess how different pieces of the puzzle fit together.\n--\nPractical Implementation of the Real Goal\nNo matter how much of the fundamental knowledge you have, if you are unable to put it to practice, then usually it is of no real value.\nThis course not only focuses on getting you ahead of others in understanding how a voice user interface works, but helps you build your very own uber cool personal assistant using Amazon Alexa, that can do what you can make it do.\nBuilding a personal assistant using Alexa Custom Skills is just one of the techniques, and you will learn very soon that you can design a variety of interfaces through the knowledge that you gain.\nAmazon has always been ahead of the game in terms of building voice interfaces, and you will be able to understand how you can leverage what Amazon has to offer to get you to communicate with machines effectively.\n--\nWhat will you learn?\nBy using Amazon Alexa, and building a Voice Activated Personal Assistant, you will gain the following:\nUnderstand what is Amazon Alexa and its ecosystem\nWhat are Voice Interaction Models, and how they can help you build a better and reliable voice interface\nKnow the technologies that work behind a voice activated interface\nUse Amazon Services such as Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, & IAM and how they interact with each other\nDeconstruct an Alexa Skill, and get clarity on what are Intents, Slots, and Utterances\nDevelop with Node.js 10.x and Alexa Skills Kit SDK v2 to build a personal assistant that responds to your queries\nConnect with Third Party APIs and process information, use asynchronous requests, promises, and await expressions in async functions\nMaintain data persistence within an Active Alexa Session\nIntroduce errors, and Test Alexa Skills through 4 different modes including simulators and physical devices\nLeverage the Amazon Web Services to build a Consistently Reliable Architecture\nYou will get a complete checklist on what all you will be achieving, with code that is available on GitHub for easy access. The lectures will have links, files, and diagrams attached to them wherever relevant.\nEven if you do not have the knowledge of Node.js, you will be able to fundamentally understand how you can build custom skills, and implement it in your own preferred language.\nThe sooner you get into building the voice interfaces, the faster you will be able to mould the machines to your liking.\nEnroll Now, and begin to shape the brand new voice activated world!",

It is highly recommended, though not mandatory, to to take this course before this one.\n\n\nBut wait, that's not all!\nOne of the most important product of the architect's work are the architecture diagrams. These diagrams are the epitome of the architecture process, and summarize and represent the various aspects of the architecture.\nAnd so, for each case study, you'll have the complete architecture diagram, with all the services we discussed in the design process.\nIn addition, for each case study we'll analyze its estimated monthly cost, and explain how we got there.\nAnd the good part?\nYou can download these diagrams and the cost estimations for your own use. These diagrams are a great starter for architecture diagrams, and there's a good chance your own system is quite similar to at least one of the case studies in this course. And even if not - you can still use it as a base for your own. Simply put - it's yours to use.\nThis course is the only course that gives you access to real-world, production based cloud architectures, based on systems designed by real architects, developed by real developers, and have millions of $ invested in them. Don't miss this opportunity!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"well done - The course was very practical\" - Sam\n\"[The course] given me the confidence to go out to the market and advertise myself as such [an Architect]\" - Mathew\n\"Life Changing\" - Arivazhagan\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nActually, any person who is involved in cloud development, even system analyst, can profit from this course.\nHowever, the best candidate for this course is a Cloud Architect that wants to expand her knowledge, or a developer with some cloud experience, preferably 2 years. This experience will help mainly in understanding the terminology used in this course.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been a Software & Cloud Architect for more than 20 years, working with a variety of clients - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained tens thousands of students in various courses in the past.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients.",

      "description": "Overview\nVMware vSphere is the most popular platform for deploying virtualized workloads. In this course you will learn how to build reliable enterprise grade VMware vSphere infrastructure from scratch to fully operational production environment.\nIs this a right course for me? (Please click blue Full details link below)\nHave you ever wondered how to set-up your own VMware vSphere infrastructure? How everything is working together to create reliable environment for virtual machines? I have designed this course to help you to understand key concepts of VMware vSphere and I will guide you through whole process of creating your own VMware vSphere infrastructure.\nWhat is covered?\nI won’t be talking much about theory and all those fancy acronyms you can see everywhere. Instead of that we will create our very new enterprise grade VMware vSphere environment. We will install three hypervisors and central management platform, configure real world networking and interconnect everything together. Then I will cover key functions of our newly created environment such is high availability, shared storage, migrations of virtual machines and all useful functions that might be handy in real world. After this course, you will be able to set-up you own VMware vSphere environment in your company from the scratch and provide reliable infrastructure for your virtual machines.\nAm I going to be bored?\nI have tried to be as practical as possible. I won’t disturb you with those little things like “How many hypervisors can be part of a cluster? Is it 32 or 64?” No, we will be learning things by doing them in my lab. Because of those practical lessons I hope you will enjoy them much more than some theory based lectures.\nWhat others say\nFew selected reviews. Thank you!\nAfter finishing the course and recreating everything in my VMware workstation nested ESXi Lab. I learned a lot of things that i can use at my job. I am aspiring to join the vmware experts at my company and this put me on a fast track towards achieving that. This filled in a huge gap (production grade design that I can use in my VCP lab) in my studies for VCP 6. Many thanks to the author. I hope he adds more design related videos and shares his experiences about designing private clouds in the bonus section. I would like the videos to be geared towards new VMware architects.\nLove it Love It Love It. Deatailled and extremely easy to understand and follow.\nI am junior VMware administrator and this course was really usefully for me.

Compared to another course on the same subject I did in parallel, this course went into depth as well as were not afraid of some repetition. I got not only comfortable with working with serverless, but cloud resources in general. Thanks for clear explanations paired with solid material.\n5 STARS - Awesome course, thanks Ranga again for the fantastic content you present\n5 STARS - It's a good match for my interests and where i want to be in future - i.e. knee deep in coding/dev ops/cloud\n\n\nDo you have ZERO experience with Serverless, AWS, and Azure?\nDo you want to build an amazing full-stack Serverless application in AWS and Azure with an easy-to-learn, step-by-step approach?\nDo you want to learn AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Amazon API Gateway, Azure API Management, Amazon Cognito, and Azure AD B2C?\nAre you ready to learn Serverless and take the next step in your programming career?\nDo you want to join 500,000+ learners having Amazing Learning Experiences with in28Minutes?\nLook No Further!\n\n\nCOURSE OVERVIEW\nBuilding Serverless Applications in AWS and Azure is a lot of fun.\nWe will start with understanding the fundamentals of building Serverless REST API in AWS with Lambda Functions and API Gateway. You will learn to monitor, version, and configure your AWS Lambda Functions. You will learn to build your REST API using API Gateway. We will explore the two important types of API Gateway in-depth - HTTP API and REST API. You will learn to implement validation, rate limiting, and multiple stages with AWS API Gateway.\nAfter that, we switch our focus to deploying a full-stack todo management application with a Serverless approach in AWS. We will use Amazon DynamoDB to store our todos. We will build our REST API using Lambda Functions and API Gateway. We will deploy our Front end application as a static website to Amazon S3. We will use Amazon Cognito to manage and authenticate our users.\nBuilding Lambda Functions and configuring API Gateway manually is a pain. We will learn to automate building Serverless applications in AWS with the Serverless Framework and Serverless Application Model. We will build and deploy a complete Serverless REST API (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + Amazon DynamoDB) with Serverless Framework and Serverless Application Model.\nThis course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to Serverless in AWS and Azure.\nYou will be using AWS Lambda (Serverless Functions), API Gateway (API Management), Amazon DynamoDB (Database), Amazon S3 (to deploy frontend application), Amazon Cognito (Authentication and Authorization), Azure Functions (Serverless Functions), Azure API Management and Azure AD B2C (Authentication). We will be using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.\nStart Learning Now. Hit the Enroll Button!",

The 6 required areas for a BRD in IT are as follows:\n(1) SCOPE. The Business Analyst/Project Manager needs to know which features of the project\nare his/her responsibility and which features are not his/her responsibility.\n(2) CONSTRAINTS. For examples, constraints or limits on the project budget or required time of completion for the project.\n(3) ASSUMPTIONS. This may refer to \"an educated guess\" - for example, assuming that testing resources will be available when parts of the project need to be tested.\n4) FRONT-END TECHNOLOGIES (VISIBLE AREAS). For example, a Graphic User Interface or GUI.\n(5) BACK-END TECHNOLOGIES (NON-VISIBLE AREAS), which describes technology that the user cannot see in the browser. For example, a database or server.\n(6) REGULATIONS, which describes the regulatory standards that apply to the project being developed.\n\n\nColorful graphics animate the discussion, and a quiz follows each lecture. The quizzes are based on\nreal-life scenarios, and they facilitate the process of learning and remembering new subject matter.\nIn addition, a final exercise, as well as a glossary of IT-related terms, help the student produce\nhis/her first BRD.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, the student will have acquired the skills for gathering the information\nrequired for a very professional BRD.",

      "description": "This is not a beginners course!\nThis is an advanced Qt 6 course using C++ to create high performance applications on Windows, Mac and Linux. This course also includes advanced topics such as threading, networking, libraries, plugins, databases, unit testing, and application deployment.\n\n\nThis is a followup to the Udemy Qt 5 Core for beginners and intermediate courses and picks up where they both left off. It is highly recommended to take those courses before attempting this one. In this course you will learn how to work with threads, sockets, libraries, plugins, unit testing, and application deployment across multiple operating systems.\n\n\nThreading\nThreads help make your applications lighting fast. You will learn threading best practices, along with some common misconceptions and mistakes. Additionally we will dive into thread pools which are highly fast and efficient use of threads. And we will cover how to simplify threading using the Qt Concurrent Library.\n\n\nNetworking\nWe will cover general networking concepts along with who to use both TCP and UDP sockets to communicate with remote servers. This course also covers how to use SSL encryption to maintain a secure connection with the remote host. Later on in the networking section we will demonstrate how to make a basic TCP server, then combine threading and SSL to make a high performance TCP server that can handle a lot of simultaneous connections.\n\n\nLibraries\nWe will teach what libraries are, and how you can easily create your own libraries along with how to use libraries created by other developers. This course also covers shared vs static libraries, and even how to make your application expandable by developing a simple plugin system that allows you to dynamically add functionality to your application while its running without recompiling your application.\n\n\nDatabases\nThis is a broad topic and we will show just the basics of how to use the Qt SQL libraries and vendor drivers to connect to and use databases. We do demonstrate a few concepts using MySql.\n\n\nTesting\nThis course will teach how to use the Qt Test library, which will help you perform unit and data driven tests on your application. We will even cover how to perform some simple bench marking to spot performance issues in your code.\n\n\nDeployment\nDeploying your applications to end users is both an art and a science. While there are millions of ways to deploy your applications, we will show some basic techniques for Windows, Mac and Linux. In case you need to have a custom deployment, this course does cover how to compile Qt in both Dynamic and Static linking, which allows you to choose between having a dependency tree or an all in one application.\n\n\nFeaturing closed caption in: English, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, Traditional Chinese",

This \"PLAIN AND SIMPLE\" series on Healthcare Information Systems is different. It strives to introduce the basic concepts of information technology and systems in a very simple and easy to understand format using many examples from both non-healthcare and healthcare environments. This course is targeted at the entry level (Basic and Intermediate Level) learner.\nThe content of the series is based on the author's 35 years experience in the healthcare information systems business. This experience spans product design and launch, marketing, business development and executive management (including president). In addition, it is based on 15 years teaching at the graduate level in the University environment.",

And there has been a paradigm shift in the volume of information and the ways in which it can be extracted from this data.\nELK is one of the few new-age frameworks which is capable of handling Big Data demands and scale.\nOver the years the ELK stack has become quite popular. And for a good reason. It is a very robust, mature and feature rich framework.\nELK is used by large enterprises, government organizations and startups alike. The ELK stack has a very rich and active community behind it. They develop, share and support tons of source code, components, plugins and knowledge about these tools freely and openly.\nImagine a large organization, which has information coming in from varied sources, at varied frequencies, and in various formats. It will be a herculean task to sort and sift through this data and normalize it to use for any comprehensive analysis. We will need a pretty versatile and flexible tool to deal with all these permutations of data streams.\nIn this course, we will focus on one such enterprise data collection and collation tool-The LogStash which is one of the core components of the ELK stack. We will look at the overview and explore the technology that goes behind this tool.\nKnowledge and experience about ELK and LogStash could be very valuable for your career. The latest stats and figures show some amazing numbers like jobs requiring these skill sets pay higher than most of the jobs posted on public job boards within the US and annual salaries for professionals could be as high as $100,000. That is the exact reason why you must enroll in this course and take your career to the next level.\nAs the title suggests – this course aims to provide you enough knowledge about ELK and LogStash so that you can run and operate your own data ingestion pipelines cluster using these components together. But specifically:\nYou will get familiar with the features and benefits offered by LogStash.\nSince this course provides detailed demos of installation and configuration of LogStash, it will equip you well for future use of this technology.\nThe more equipped you are, the more sought after you will be. And this course will be a right step towards improving your work/ project/ career prospects.\nSo come, join me on this exciting journey of learning ElK stack and in particular the LogStash data ingestion tool.",

      "description": "Active Directory, a foundational technology introduced with Windows 2000, remains integral to modern domains, employing key concepts such as users, computers, groups, and organizational units. These elements are as vital today as they were at the inception of Active Directory administration.\nMastering Active Directory , Group Policy and Server Administration is essential for any IT professional or helpdesk technician, as these skills are universally applied in large organizations with IT support teams. In this comprehensive course on Active Directory and Group Policy, you will learn:\nHow to efficiently manage Active Directory user accounts, groups, and organizational units using the Active Directory Users and Computers console.\nBest practices for setting and resetting Active Directory account passwords.\nUtilizing the Active Directory search facility to quickly locate what you need.\nCreating and managing group policies effectively.\nUnderstanding the importance of local computer policies in relation to group policies.\nDetailed explanations of user password policies.\nHow to use Group Policy Preferences and Starter GPOs.\nThe mechanics of replication and the role of the SYSVOL folder.\nAdditionally, this course includes valuable shortcuts and tutorials on command-line utilities that will be beneficial in your IT support career. Knowing the most efficient way to complete a task can often be beneficial, especially if you have a lot to do within a short space of time.\n\n\nOn the DNS part of the course, you'll find information on Domain Name System (DNS) configuration on Windows Server , topics covered include the following:\n\n\n* Installation and Configuration of DNS Services - Explanation of how to install DNS with a walkthrough guide\n* Creating and managing DNS Zones - Deals with primary, secondary and stub zones\n* Creating and managing DNS Records - Covers different types of DNS records\n* Explanation of special record types and reverse DNS - i.e. TXT records and PTR records\n* Root Zones and Nameservers - Settings dealing with where DNS goes to if it can't find a resource record\n* Load balancing - Balances traffic between multiple servers\n* Configuring DNS Scavenging - Deals with clearing old and unused DNS records - use with care!\n* Securing DNS in a production environment - Prevents potential DNS based attacks\n\n\nIdeally, any practice should be done on a test environment, as some configuration changes can have wide-spread impact on your organisation if done incorrectly. As with any changes to a production environment, you should be sure to follow your organisation's change control processes as appropriate.\n\n\nNote that this can vary largely from organisation to organisation, because most of them, and especially the larger ones, will have this in place and often you can only get non-emergency changes approved once a week, at least in my experience.\n\n\nOn the WDS part of the course, we'll be covering how to install and configure Windows Deployment Services, otherwise known as WDS. Topics covered on this course are as follows:\n\n\n* An overview of Windows Deployment Services and how it can benefit your organisation\n* The difference between Active Directory Integrated and Standalone configuration modes\n* Setting up and installing Windows Deployment Services\n* A detailed overview of the WDS Console itself\n* The DISM command and the various subcommands available within DISM.\n* Setting up your WDS server to accept incoming connections from client machines\n* How to setup a multicast transmission.\n\n\nNote that there may be some additional steps required for WDS setup, depending on your network environment, such as making sure that there are no speed limitations or other restrictions that can sometimes be an issue with managed switches commonly found on corporate networks.\nAlso, there may be times where it's more appropriate to do a manual install rather than rely on automation, this often applies in smaller branch office environments that may not necessarily have enough bandwidth to do this or where it would be quicker to use other deployment methods with the same image, i.e. a USB stick for an office with less than 10 or so computers.\n\n\nOne of the many tools that administrators use on a daily basis is the Windows Command Line (cmd) / Prompt. On the cmd part of this course, you'll learn the following skills, which are often used in the real world by computer technicians:\n\n\n* How to create, rename, move and delete files and directories within the Windows operating system using the command line.\n* The different types of file systems and how to navigate between directories using the cmd prompt.\n* Setting the date and time on your PC using the date, time and tzutil commands\n* Managing and formatting disk drives using the Diskpart command\n* Shutting down, restarting and logging off your machine\n* Viewing and applying group policy information using the Gpupdate and Gpresult commands, which can often be useful when troubleshooting conflicting group policies.\n* Creating cmd batch files and some of the most common commands used within them, which can often save time when dealing with repetitive tasks.\n* How to access system information contained within the Windows Management Instrumentation database (WMI) information using the WMIC command and sub-commands.\n\n\nWhilst there are some differences between versions of Windows, a lot of these commands haven't changed since Windows 2000, meaning that any prior knowledge of this subject, while not essential by any means, would be advantageous at any stage of your IT career.",

Perhaps this is because some conceptual requirements are inherent in almost all projects. Each conceptual requirement is formulated as a question that the architect must ask himself during the project. Of course, some systems may have their own additional critical conceptual requirements.\nWe will get to know the types of software architectures. We will be able to create our own simple software architecture. We will be able to use and expand the software architecture. As a result, this course will be useful not only for architects or people who plan to become one.

Watch the first video for details**\n\n\nSo you want to deploy a blockchain but are overwhelmed by the sea of information out there that is half-baked and seems to want to do too much at the same time.\nIf so, this course is for you. We will start by explaining exactly what a blockchain is from a technical perspective instead of a high-level business overview. We start from absolute zero, assume no background and give the details only as much as necessary. Then, we move on to the highly popular and industry backed blockchain framework -- Hyperledger Fabric and its high-level library -- Composer. We explain how to set everything up and then move to creating our first blockchain and then a smart contract.\nWe will also cover how this blockchain can be used from an existing application using a REST API. This would enable you to start using blockchains in your own applications that can benefit from a blockchain or distributed ledger.\nWe take a case study-based approach and motivate why we need the commands we're running and how everything fits together. If there is a concept that is typically covered in similar courses but isn't immediately necessary for deploying our first smart contract, we'll skip it. We aim to have our first smart contract up and running in about an hour and then integrate with it from outside the Fabric environment by the end of this course -- a total of about 1.5 hours.\nThere is also a real-time chat system in place for students who enroll in this course. With a free signup, you get access to real-time chat with myself and fellow students who are working to complete this course (or have completed the course before you). We plan on creating this network of like-minded experts who can help each other out and collaborate on exciting ideas together.\n\n\nWhat will I learn?\nBasics of a hash\nHow this simple concepts enable the powerful blockchain architecture\nInstall and configure Hyperledger Fabric using the easiest method available\nInstall and run Composer -- a high-level, easy to use interface to Fabric\nSet up a REST API to use our blockchain from outside Fabric\nUse a REST API testing application and then PHP to access data from our blockchain\nUse the Latest Fabric 2.x\n\n\nAbout the instructor:\n\nTeacher and researcher by profession\nPhD in Security and a PostDoc from Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany\n17+ years of working with computers and 15+ years of teaching experience\n10+ years of working professionally as a Linux System Administrator -- including 5+ years of provable track record on UpWork (with 5.0 star rating there)\nWhat you need to know:\n\nNo prerequisites are assumed.\n\n\n*** UPDATES ***\nUpdated videos and files for commands changed in the next release of the official docs (just 5 days after the release of the course).\nAdded Fabric 2.x details now.",

      "description": "In today's fast-paced and dynamic business environment, containerization and orchestration are becoming increasingly important. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and management, providing organizations with the flexibility and scalability needed to manage modern applications.\nMicrosoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that eliminates the complexity of managing and scaling your Kubernetes infrastructure, enabling you to focus on building and deploying your applications. AKS offers benefits such as seamless integration with other Azure services, rapid deployment and scaling, automatic upgrades, built-in security and compliance, and much more.\nThis course is meant to make AKS easy to learn, understand, and to provide students with a comprehensive and practical experience with AKS.\nThe course start with an introduction about containers and Kubernetes, then we will cover topics such as creating and managing Kubernetes clusters, understand the components at Kubernetes and Azure level, configuring networking with respect to network plugins, Kubernetes services, SNAT, outbound types and types of AKS clusters in relation to control plane access, like public or private AKS clusters and the ones with VNET integration.\nSecurity will be the next topics and we will start with a section about AKS-managed Active Directory integration, then we will look gain knowledge of identities, certificates, network policies, how to use secrets from the Azure Key Vault, about Azure policy, Microsoft Defender, AppArmor, and SecComp.\nScaling is important, so we will discover resource reservations, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Vertical Pod Autoscaler, Cluster Autoscaler (CAS), Virtual Nodes add-on, and KEDA.\nThe next section will be Storage, and you will learn how to use Azure Disk, including snapshot, resize, Azure File, and Azure Blob in AKS.\nThen, we will discover the monitoring and troubleshooting chapter, where we will learn default available features as well as enabling Container Insights or managed Prometheus and Grafana.\nSubsequent to this, we will learn about upgrades and related features like auto-upgrade or planned maintenance, then how to integrate our AKS cluster with the Azure Container Registry.\nAfter this, we will focus on ingress controllers, like application gateway ingress controllers (AGIC) and nginx ingress controllers, and how to expose an application via HTTPS or how to use Let's Encrypt and Cert Manager.\nFinally, we will focus on high availability, and you will learn about available tiers, availability zones, and how to obtain reliability while routing traffic between multiple AKS clusters.\nBy the end of this course, you will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to effectively deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters in AKS, and to leverage the benefits of AKS in the industry, including faster application development, improved scalability, and increased flexibility.",

I understand companies ensure Oracle MAA (Maximum Availability Architecture) but trust me it’s time to embrace Oracle MSA (Maximum Security Architecture). Through this course I will demystify the Oracle database security for On-Prem and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\nI will show the evidence of the Top 10 Data Security Breaches of 21st century. We will try and understand the Major Security Threats , Artefacts of Database Security and will give you a good understanding of Oracle Maximum Security Architecture.\nFor our learning we shall build 3 environments:\n· Oracle On-Prem Environment on VM Machine\n· Oracle Virtual Machine DB System\n· Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB).\nWe will start our learning with Oracle Database Vault , understand the features, components, Separation of Duties. We will perform some demos to understand how to configure Database Vault for CDB & PDB. We will understand the concept behind Realms and also configure our own realm. We will work on a couple of use cases regarding the permissions that need to be given to the DBA to export the schema protected by realms. We will also configure the Database Vault for Autonomous Databases as well.\nOne of the most important requirements from the regulators is the Data Encryption which can be configured for Data at Rest using Transparent Data Encryption(TDE) and for Data in Transit using Native Network Encryption (NNE). We will go deep dive to understand TDE Key Architecture and the concept of Oracle Key vaults. I will perform strings command on the data files and show you that your Table’s data is visible in clear text format and then will implement TDE and encrypt the data at rest. Same way I will show you that if you inspect the network packets the data in transit is available in clear text, once NNE is implemented the data in transit gets encrypted as well.\nNext we will move to assessment of Database security through Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT), We will learn the DBSAT Components, tools and perform demo for DBSAT collector / reporter and also understand and look at the different output files that are created by DBSAT.\nAnother key architectural change for post 12c release was Oracle Unified Auditing, we will understand the comparison between the traditional vs Unified auditing. The Unified Auditing brings a number of policies which come out of box and are enabled by default. For our demos we will enable the unified auditing to run in pure mode , we will make use of the out of the box policies and also create our own customized policy.\nIn the end we will move onto an amazing feature Oracle Data Safe which helps to bring entire database security under one umbrella. The Oracle Data Safe can be used for On-Prem database, VM / BM Database Systems and Autonomous Databases. Through Oracle Data Safe we will perform the demos to achieve Database Security Assessment, User Assessment , Data Sensitive Discovery and Data Masking.\n\n\nRegards\nKshitij Joy (OCM & OCI Architect)\nDB Alchemist Academy",

Most of the papers were accepted in peer review Journals that used SWAT model. This model has inbuilt data for the USA. But it does not have data for other countries. So we need to configure this model for non-us locations. Even you will be able to run this model for the USA after this course because we configure this model for the whole world. Only India has a different process to configure this model and a different for other countries. So I will cover all methods and prepare dataset, simulate two time this model for you one for India and one for any other country in the world. I will Start from scratch. Show you the configuration of data , data download, sources, modify data set, theoretical aspect, Practical . even after the simulation, This course will represent you how to illustrate results in Excel. So this course will cover the entire SWAT model.  Advanced applications of R programming for weather data are also covered. You only need knowledge of two things, Landuse generation and ArcGIS Just basic not advanced. The rest of all you leave on me I will cover. You just need Basic GIS. The only thing is that you must have land use. After Enroll to this course you will get ready made soil map for SWAT for world also. You will also learn how to make it for SWAT. You will learn to setup all weather and climate data for swat. I hope you will publish good papers after learning this. You can also use this course for short term training course in your University. Just need to play on screen. Everything in this course is 90% practical. This course is advance course of GIS. Applicable to ArcGIS 10.0 to 10.7\nHardware Requirement: For small study area less than 10,000km/sq no Problem. But larger than this you must have a high-performance PC.",

      "description": "This course is all about Git and GitHub/GitLab/Azure Devops.\nThis course comprehensively covers not only Git but also possible Git hosting providers such as GitHub/GitLab or Azure DevOps, which means no prior knowledge or experience is required.\nStarting from the very basics we will move to more intermediate topics (Branching, Merging, Rebasing, ...) and finally progress onto advanced topics such as Submodules, Subtrees, ect & dot repos and more.\nIf those terms are new to you - jump in and you will learn all that and more using multiple practice examples and animated slides.\nBecome a Git expert with proficiency in Repository/Team Management in GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps.\nThis is the most complete and comprehensive Git and GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps course, with tons of practical activities enchanted with animated slides for better understanding as well as a 30-page Cheat-Sheet. By the end of this course you will be the person to ask about Git! Everything will be taught from scratch, from the very basics to the advanced topics. If you truly want to master Git and GitHub/GitLab/Azure Devops this course is for you.\nFor those who are interested which commands will be covered in this course here is a list (without additional options that will be explored in the course):\ngit add · git bisect · git blame · git branch · git checkout · git cherry-pick · git clean · git clone · git commit · git config · git diff · git grep ·  git fetch · git gc · git gui · git init · git log · git ls-files · git merge · git merge-base · git merge-file ·  git mergetool · git mv · git pull · git push · git rebase · git reflog · git remote · git reset · git restore · git rev-list · git revert · git rm · git shortlog · git show · git stage · git status · git submodule · git subtree · git switch · git tag\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis course is divided into 10 chapters, which will explore and go into detail on several core topics surrounding git. Below is a small summary for each chapter:\nChapter 1 focuses on clarifying the difference between Git and hosting services such as GitHub & GitLab.\nChapter 2 is a quick dive into Git and its most used commands. After this you will be comfortable with basic Git operations such as git add · git commit · git push · git pull · git status · git log · git cherry-pick · git checkout · and more. You will also know how to setup a .gitignore file and be able to create Branches and merge them. And finally we will cover Authentication methods such as (HTTPS vs SSH).\nChapter 3 focuses purely on Git! This is the longest chapter in the course for a good reason. Having finished this chapter you will be able to perform pretty much all actions there are to Git, such as Commits · Undoing Commits · Branches · Merging · Stashing · Remote Repositories · Merge-Conflicts · Rebasing · Tags · Commit References · Git Interna and more...\nChapter 4 will probably be most peoples' favourite as we won't be making changes to a Repository ourselves, but retrieve information of an already existing Repository. This will include extensive use of the following commands with various options of git log · git tag · git reflog · git show · git diff · git grep · git blame · git bisect · git shortlog. You will also learn how to visualize a Repository using Gitstats & gitk & GitKraken.\nChapter 5 is all about GitHub, the most known and used Git Hosting Service. After completing this chapter you will be able to manage and set up Personal Repositories as well as Organisations/Teams with ease. This includes managing Pull-Requests and also setting up recommended permissions and protecting branches. Furthermore you will also practice on how to link Issues and Pull-Requests together and also create and use Labels. For managing purposes we will set up automated Issue/Project Boards. Last but not least we will make use of GitHub Actions and create a GitHub Wiki + GitHub Pages and finally set up some security with Dependabot and CodeQL.\nChapter 6 is all about GitLab, probably the second most used Git Hosting Service. This Chapter covers the same topics as chapter 5 (GitHub) but for GitLab. This will include Merge Requests & Permissions (Personal + Groups) · Issues & Labels · Member permissions & roles · Forking · Project Boards & Milestones · Wiki & Code Snippets · CI/CD Pipeline Basics · GitLab Pages · Web IDE.\nChapter 7 focuses on two other known Git Hosting Services: Azure DevOps & Bitbucket. The topics in this chapter will be similar to what you've learned for GitHub & GitLab.\nChapter 8 covers Workflows. After this chapter you will be able to setup a necessary Workflow and decide which Workflow is suitable for your Repository/Project. The following Workflows are covered: Solo-Development · Feature Branches · Gitflow - Long Running Branches · Trunk-based Development.\nChapter 9 will handle advanced topics with various exercises. We will set up different Hooks (pre-commit, post-commit, commit-msg, pre-push) to enchant our Development and Workflow-Guidelines. Afterwards we will have a deep dive on how to properly write commit-messages, such as splitting it up into a subject + body and linking it with Issues & Merge/Pull-requests from GitHub & GitLab. Furthermore we will learn and practice Git Submodules & Subtrees, two very advanced Git topics. At the end we will make our lives easier by adding some Git Aliases and setup 2FA for GitHub.\nChapter 10 covers topics that are unknown to most Git users like how to manage your /etc directory with Git and how to setup a Dotfiles Repository. As some Repositories use binary files, we're going to practice and setup Git LFS (Large File Storage). At the end we will use Visual Studio Code and install the well known GitLens extension.\nChapter 11 contains the downloadable Cheat-Sheet.\nChapter 12 will contain lessons that will be added to the course from time to time to keep it up-to-date. Currently there's lessons about signed commits for GitHub.\n\n\nYou will not just use the terminal to perform Git operations. In parallel you will also learn to use GUI applications for various use cases:\nGitHub Desktop\ngitk\nVisual Studio Code (+ GitLens)\nGitKraken\nTortoiseGit\nMeld (For Merge-Conflicts)\nGitstats\nGit GUI\n\n\nJoin now and you will get lifetime-long access to 31 hours of content packed with tons of practical exercises and a 30-page Cheat Sheet! After finishing this course you will be the person to ask about Git in your company and you will be able to perform advanced tasks with ease!\nYou also get a 30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked!\nJoin now to become a true Git master!",

The focus is on API management tools using off-the-shelf (ready-to-use) software\nYou don't need any credit card or payment to use tools in this course. All software (including the API manager itself) is available as a free edition. Some might even open-source their codes.\n\n\nUpdate January 2024\nMajor Update\nUse Kong 3, Elastic 8, and the latest software version (as of 2024)\nImproved audio for ALL lectures\n\n\nUpdate November 2020\nMajor Update\nUse Kong 2, Elastic 7, and the latest software version (as of 2020)\nAdded: OAuth2\nAdded: Proxy Cache\nImproved audio for ALL lectures\n\n\nBefore We Begin\nIf you want to learn, you simply need a web browser. For running tools and hands-on, specific hardware and software are required. Please see the requirements in Lecture One (with the title Readme First: Hardware & Software Required).\n\n\nPrerequisites\nWe will use Docker (container technology) to install the tools required for this API management course. In this course, you will learn basic knowledge of Docker. To install docker, you need to be familiar with:\nWindows: basic command prompt usage & command, administrator access\nMac / Linux: basic terminal usage & command, root / sudo access\nI provide Docker installation instructions for Windows 10 Professional Edition. For any other operating system -including other version of Windows-, I provide reference to official documentation, but not the video. I'm sorry about this, since I don't have a Mac / Linux machine.\nDon't worry; the official documentation is complete and easy to follow.\n\n\n\n\nWorks with REST API\nYour workplace adopts modern architecture and relies on REST API. Having REST API gives benefits, but the benefits come at a cost. For most teams, the processes of setting and enforcing standards or policies across their APIs are entirely manual. Often that process involves multiple teams or team members and becomes even more painful as the number of APIs grows.\nNow that you have provisioned your APIs, you also need to have visibility on your APIs.  How is your API traffic trending over time? Which API is used most? Which API has a large error rate? Having this data will help you analyze and make the correct decision for further API development.\nPolicies, securities, or analytics can be implemented by writing additional logic on your APIs. You can even write your own analytics tools for monitoring & analyzing your APIs. But those processes will be redundant and time-consuming. Why don't we find a more efficient way for developers to focus on business needs?  That will ultimately maximize the productivity of the developers who build on the API and, in turn, benefit the company.\nAPI Management Software\nAPI management tools can be an answer. API manager tools in the market likely provide common API capabilities, like:\nAPI gateway, a single communication point for accessing API\nBasic security for accessing API\nTraffic control, like rate limiting or quota\nMonitor API health (is API accessible or down?)\nLoad balancing\nAPI Analytics (hit rate, error rate)\nLogging your traffic\nThe developer portal acts as API documentation. A common API documentation format is swagger / Open API specification\n\n\nBig players like Google, IBM, or Axway provide good features for API management -if you are willing to pay some amount of money-. But if you prefer an open-source, start-small approach (but still good), there are also several API manager tools in the market, one of which is Kong API Manager (which we use in this course).\nIn this course, we will learn API Management using several tools. All software is available as a free edition. Some come with the option to upgrade to a premium edition with more features. The tools we will learn here are:\nKong API management\nThis is the main focus of this course.\nDocker and docker-compose\nPopular container technology to speed up our installation and configuration. However, this course is NOT a docker course, so we will not go deep into docker.\nZipkin\nAn open-source REST API tracing tool. Useful for distributed tracing on different services, even if the API services are scattered on several machines.\nElasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana\nA Popular search engine and its visualization tools. This course is an introductory course on how to use these stacks to analyze your API traffic. However, this course does not focus on the elastic stack.\nPrometheus & Grafana\nOpen-source monitoring tools to gather performance metrics and display those metrics as time-series charts.\n\n\nBenefits of API Management (for Engineering and Business)\nLet's face it: we have time constraints. Business needs those APIs. And they need it fast.\nWriting API that just functionally works but is not secure or is technically flawed will bring trouble sooner or later. Maybe somebody will find a security hole in your API and exploit it. Or do you work in a place where API is used in many places by many people / systems? Without transparency in API analytics (usage, error rate, etc.), it is difficult to know whether your API works fine or needs improvement.\nWriting codes for implementing API security, analytics, or some other technical aspects is nice. Either veteran programmers or new kids in the house will love the challenge of writing such codes and solving complex problems.\nBut the time constraints speak loudly. Writing such codes can be time-consuming. It is a good thing to focus developers' efforts on delivering business logic, which, in turn, keeps the business ahead.\nAPI management can be used to help you solve common API aspects, like security, analytics, or who can access which API. And most of the time, you don't need to write any code. Put your API behind some API management, and configure it to work with your API.\nThat means productivity increases. Whatever role you have in the company, productivity is always a good thing, and API management (even open-source) can help you boost it.\n\n\nKong API Management\nKong provides an API gateway for REST APIs with a plug-in architecture to enable users to add functionalities to the core Kong gateway. Kong's API management platform is attractively lean. It should appeal to users with basic\nrequirements who want to get an initial platform that they can then add as they go, either\nwith Kong-or-community-provided plug-ins or with developments of their own (yes, it's possible to develop a Kong plugin based on your own requirements, although we don't cover it in this course). Companies that aim to use the Kong API management platform can start fast, as you can see in the course -less than 1 hour to set up and run-.\nUsers looking to execute digital strategies will find Kong useful for enabling their platforms.\n\n\nAPI Monitoring & Analytics\nIn this course, we will learn to do analytics and monitoring not only using Kong API Manager but also some other tools and, most importantly, how to integrate them. One tool only is quite powerful, but integration will give us more benefits\nAPI management tools usually come with an API analytics module. We can use the analytics to gain visibility of the entire API ecosystem. The analytics will automatically and continuously collect all API-traffic data, like performance time, hit rate (how many hits in seconds), and error rate. By leveraging API analytics, we can learn which APIs have good value and which ones need to be improved.\nOn the operation side, we can proactively use API monitoring tools to detect API traffic and performance issues. Imagine if a service is down at 10 AM, and nobody knows until one hour later, which means problems have already arisen and some business opportunity might already lost. By leveraging open-source Kong API management (and several other free tools), we can get a notification in less than 5 minutes after the service is troubled.",

Blockchain Basics- Blockchain technology and its Types\nBlockchain technology allows secure, decentralized interactions without middlemen. It entails a network of computers validating and recording events in immutable blocks. There are two kinds of blockchains: public (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and private. Public blockchains provide transparency and decentralization, whereas private blockchains give a particular user group more control and anonymity. Beyond finance, this ground-breaking technology has the ability to revolutionize numerous other sectors.\nII. Designing a blockchain for a new cryptocurrency\nDesigning a blockchain for a new cryptocurrency involves a variety of technical, economic, and more. Identifying the currency's objectives, intended level of decentralization, and level of security is the initial phase. The consensus method, computer language, and other technical considerations must then be made. Although it is a difficult procedure, it has the potential to produce a currency that is both unique and precious.\nIII. Cryptocurrency Mining\nExplanation of mining and how it works:\nMining is the process of verifying and adding new transactions to a blockchain ledger. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and when they solve them, they're rewarded with new coins. This system is what keeps the blockchain secure and trustworthy.\n\n\nProof-of-work vs proof-of-stake:\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two different ways to verify transactions on a blockchain. Proof-of-work requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. In contrast, proof-of-stake allows users to validate transactions by holding a certain amount of coins, without the need for powerful computing resources.\n\n\nSetting up a mining pool:\nSetting up a mining pool involves creating a group of miners who work together to mine cryptocurrency. By pooling their resources, miners can solve blocks faster and earn more rewards. To set up a mining pool, you'll need to create mining pool software, set up a server, and create a website or app for miners to join the pool. You'll also need to set up a payment system to distribute rewards to miners.\n\n\nIV. Wallet Development\nTypes of wallets and their functions:\nHot Wallets: Connected to the internet, convenient for daily use\nCold Wallets: Offline storage, secure for long-term holding\nHardware Wallets: Physical devices for added security\nPaper Wallets: Printed or written copies of private keys for offline storage.\n\n\nDeveloping a desktop wallet for your cryptocurrency:\nChoose a programming language and framework\nImplement basic wallet functions (send/receive transactions, generate keys)\nConnect to the blockchain network via APIs\nAdd security features (encryption, backup/restore options)\nTest and deploy the wallet.\n\n\nV. API and Explorer Setup\nExplanation of APIs and explorers:\nAPIs are like doors that allow the software to communicate with a cryptocurrency's blockchain. Explorers are like search engines that allow users to search for transactions and other data on the blockchain.\n\n\nSetting up APIs and explorers for your cryptocurrency:\nTo set up APIs and explorers for a cryptocurrency, developers can create endpoints that allow the software to interact with the blockchain, and build web interfaces that allow users to search for and view data on the blockchain. They can also use existing API and explorer solutions, such as Etherscan for Ethereum.\nIn summary, all I can do is ensure you provide the finest and most informative course on “ How to create a cryptocurrency”, which will help you to acquire a wealth of knowledge about desktop wallets, explorers, and mining pools that will prove invaluable for a lifetime.

      "description": "This is the first landuse landcover course on Udemy the most demanding topic in GIS, In this course, I covered from data download to final results. I used ERDAS, ArcGIS, ENVI and MACHINE LEARNING. I explained all the possible methods of land use classification. More then landuse, Pre-Procession of images are covered after download and after classification, how to correct error pixels are also covered, So after learning here you no need to ask anyone about lanudse classification. I explained the theoretical concept also during the processing of data. I have covered supervised, unsupervised, combined method, pixel correction methods etc. I have also shown to correct area-specific pixels to achieve maximum accuracy. Most of this course is focused on Erdas and ArcGIS for image classification and calculations. For in-depth of all methods enrol in this course.  Image classification with Machine learning also covered in this course.\nThis course also includes an accuracy assessment report generation in erdas.\nNote: Each Land Use method  Section covers different Method from the beginning, So before starting landuse watch the entire course. Then start land use with a method that you think easy for you and best fit for your study area., then you will be able to it best. Different method is applicable to a different type of study area. This course is applicable to Erdas Version 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018. and ArcGIS Version 10.1 and above, i.e 10.4, 10.7 or 10.8\n\n\n90% practical 10% theory\nProblem faced During classification:\nSome of us faced problem during classification as:\nUrban area and barren land has the same signature\nDry river reflect the same signature as an urban area and barren land\nif you try to correct urban and get an error in barren\nIn Hilly area you cannot classify forest which is in the hill shade area.\nAdd new class after final work\nHow to get rid of this all problems Join this course.",

I spent a lot of time reading the documentation, using Google to search the internet, and any book I could get my hands on. Even with all of this, I was never able to build a working Asterisk phone system. I was very frustrated and was about to give up but then a friend of mine offered to tutor me. He showed me a simple step by step training starting with how to compile Asterisk software then going all the way through to configuring a working Asterisk phone system. Within a few days, I had the confidence and Asterisk skills to take any computer and turn it into a working Asterisk phone system.\nYou need someone to show you step by step how to work with Asterisk. Using a simple to follow video guide to walk you through how to install Asterisk, write the text-based configuration files and what the network environment looks like without wasting time searching the internet or paying thousands of dollars for on-site training.\nYou will be able to compile and install Asterisk after spending 1 hour following my step by step video tutorials. After you spend a day completing the course you will have the skill set to take any computer and turn it into an Asterisk phone system. Once you follow the course and install a couple of Asterisk systems you will be an Asterisk expert.\nSure you can use google and other internet resources to teach yourself but how many months will something like that take? There will be a lot of good and bad information when reading different articles trying to piece together training materials. A lot of the documentation you will find is outdated and is not relevant anymore making your training obsolete. You also have the option of paying for Asterisk training which costs thousands of dollars for a single course and requires you to travel to the training center incurring thousands of dollars in airfare. You will also have to use your valuable vacation time.\nOr you could buy this course I have created with easy video tutorials for only $39 and save your self a lot of time and hassle. Plus you can sell Asterisk phone systems to clients for well over $1000 each providing a custom-built Asterisk phone system.\nWith more than one million Asterisk systems being used in more than 170 countries, Asterisk is an important skill to have. Asterisk is in use by almost all Fortune 1000 companies creating many job opportunities for anyone with an Asterisk skill set.\nYou should not take this course unless you will follow along with the videos and labs to build your own Asterisk environment. This course is for people who want to learn following along with the video labs and apply that knowledge to sell Asterisk systems or get a job working with Asterisk.\nWith my course I want all my students to be completely satisfied if you have any problems or questions I want to hear from you. Let me know what I can do to fix the course so it is improved for everyone giving you no risk buying this course. You are also backed by the udemy money-back guarantee.\nIf you want be an Asterisk expert click on Take This Course button and start configuring your first Asterisk server.",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn how to build integration services using message flows, sub-flows, message models shared, and static libraries.  These integration services can accept requests from different kinds of clients, those clients can use different kinds of communication mechanisms like REST, SOAP, File, or queue-based communication. IBM ACE  has the capability to handle this kind of communication protocol.\nThe client systems can send requests in different message formats like CSV, fixed-length, JSON, XML, or any other delimited messages. If the end systems expect different kinds of messages and different kinds of data, we can use the transformation technique in ACE to modify it to desired message format.  For this different kinds of nodes are provided namely compute node, java compute node, mapping node, and XSLT node.  Compute node uses ESQL coding, the java-compute node uses java code and the XSLT node uses XSL.\nMessage models help in defining the message formats. Messages like CSV, fixed length, or any other text format mandatorily require message models to understand the message structure and to read the message contents in the program. For text and binary, we can DFDL message model.  This course detailed different kinds of message models to create and using that how to transform the message to other formats.\nDifferent routing mechanisms are explained and implemented using Group nodes, aggregate nodes, and collector nodes. The REST API implementation is explained and created service using swagger 2.0.",

It's common for one system to trigger another system(s) process, or data needs to be transferred among systems. Whether your systems are built on monolith or microservice, whatever database you use, you need data moving from one point to another. And you need those movements FAST to be processed immediately (otherwise, your life will be ruined).\nThat kind of demand is so common, and fortunately, today's technology has an answer for it. Say hello to messaging systems, where you can send messages easily from one system to another system(s) asynchronously, in an almost real-time interval. There are some popular messaging systems in the market, and in this course, we will be talking about one of the most popular: Apache Kafka.\n\n\nApache Kafka\nApache Kafka is like a central hub where you place all data from the source system(s), and the other corresponding systems take the data and process it. It is open-source, reliable, and able to work on clusters. It has a small learning curve to start, yet it is powerful enough for system integrations.\nThis course includes everything you need to know about basic Apache Kafka, and implementation using Java (Spring Framework). After finishing this course, you should be able to install, configure, and use Apache Kafka from the Java Program. In this course, we will walk through detailed step-by-step from concept to hands-on Java coding. Given such a way, you will learn to understand its logic and experience how things are done using Apache Kafka and Java source codes.\n\n\nJava and Spring Boot\nJava has been a popular language for years. It is recognized as the world's most used programming language by several programming language indexes. Due to its popularity and long history, Java has many open source projects or frameworks to help developers work more efficiently.\nOne popular Java framework is the Spring Framework. Over the years, It has grown substantially among the Java community. Almost all software components required by a Java application are available within the Spring Framework. However, configuring Spring requires some effort. This involves setting up library dependencies and configuring the required Java Spring beans using XML or annotations in Java code. Spring developers soon realized that it is possible to automate much of this work.\nSo, in 2014, Spring Boot 1.0 was released for the Java community. Spring Boot gives Java programmers many automatic helpers and led to the quick large-scale adoption of the project by Java developers.\nSpring provides good support for Kafka and the abstraction layers to work with over the native Kafka Java clients. With Spring, developing applications to interact with Apache Kafka is becoming easier.\n\n\nGithub Copilot as AI Assistant\nGitHub Copilot can streamline Java development with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka by suggesting code snippets, generating boilerplate code, and offering best practices. It helps set up Kafka producers and consumers, configure Spring Boot applications, and integrate Kafka for real-time data processing. Copilot’s contextual suggestions improve productivity and reduce errors by providing relevant code examples and automated completions, enhancing development speed and code quality in your Java projects.\n\n\nWhat You Will Get\nAfter finishing the course, you will learn:\nInstallation of Apache Kafka and Java for development environment\nHow to use AI Assistant (Github Copilot) to boost your coding productivity\nApache Kafka key concepts\nCreate publisher and consumer using Java (Spring Boot)\nBasic error handler if there is a failure during processing of Apache Kafka message\nBasic understanding of how Kafka fit into Microservice Architecture\n\n\nThe course explains not only the theory of Apache Kafka but also a lot of hands-on coding to get your hands dirty and your brain working. Whether you are a hobbyist, beginner, or experienced developer, this course will surely add value to you!\n\n\nRoad to Microservices\nMessage broker is an important pillar of microservice architecture. In microservices, we use asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication. Services communicate by exchanging messages over messaging channels like Apache Kafka.\nIn this course, you will learn the theory and hand-code of messaging with Apache Kafka, a microservice architecture communication pillar.\nLater on, you can learn more about Microservice Architecture & Patterns, with Kafka as an important component.",

You don't need any software development or coding background and the very basic Web API fundamentals are covered in this course.\nWe also use Postman to call API's that we build in this course and we also see how we can consume REST APIs that are build from third parties. This will significantly expand your flow functionality.\nFollow the chapters slowly, do all the exercises and follow along the demos. More than anything focus more on understanding the concepts than just doing things and concepts are simplified to a level that non-developers can easily understand it. Regardless, I am there to answer the questions. So when in doubt, just add your question to QA section under the lecture.\nThis course requires your basic understanding on Power Automate flows like triggers and actions.\nBest of luck and I really appreciate your feedback on the course once you finish it.",

      "description": "Almost every SAP implementation implements EDI. Yet, most consultants are blissfully unaware of how EDI works. Needless to say, there is always a good demand for consultants with good knowledge of EDI implementation. This is exactly the gap this course will fill.\n\nCourse Overview\nThis course teaches you the basics of how to implement EDI ( Electronic Data Interchange ) in SAP. It will help you understand the fundamental concepts at a much deeper level by relating them to simple business scenarios. At the same time, it will not skimp on the configuration details like Partner Profiles, Ports, Segments etc. After you finish this course you will be able to create an IDOC and process it successfully from scratch in any SAP IDES system.\nWhy take this course ?\nEver had a situation where you could not apply for a job because the requirements asked for EDI ? Ever heard words like IDocs, segments, port, partner profile tossed around in a meeting and did not know how to react ? It's all going to change with this course. Take this course and I promise you will understand everything you need to know about EDI - at least to a point where you will not feel alien to the most commonly used scenarios.\n\nWhat are the Requirements ?\nExperience at least in a technical or functional module is preferred. But at least familiarity with SAP is OK. You don't need access to an IDES system, but if you have one, it is going to help you tremendously in the hands-on. We do NOT provide access to SAP as part of this course.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThis course assumes that you have some level of exposure to SAP. You could be a\nABAP Consultant\nFunctional Consultant\nBasis Consultant\nEDI Sub-system consultant\nWhat you get from this course ?\nSection 1 - Gives you an overview of the course.\n\nSection 2 - Cover the basics of EDI, the architecture and use cases.\n\nSection 3 - Get deeper into the IDoc, the fundamental data structure in SAP used to represent EDI data\nSection 4 - Shows you the configuration required in SAP for EDI.\nSection 5 - Gives you a hands-on on Outbound IDOC Processing\nSection 6 - Gives you a hands-on on Inbound IDOC Processing\nSection 7 - Gets deeper into Application Link Enable ( ALE )\nHow to make the best of this course ?\nI strongly recommend that you practice what is being taught in the course. Starting from section 3, we talk about configuration, perform transactions and do different kinds of customization in SAP. The best way to really understand and retain what is being taught here is to make sure you practice those transactions in SAP as much as you can.",

      "description": "In the recent years – the term BigData has been gaining popularity. And there has been a paradigm shift in the volume of information and the ways in which it can be extracted from this data.\nElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana (ELK) is one of the few new-age frameworks which is capable of handling Big Data demands and scale.\nOver the years the ELK stack has become quite popular. And for a good reason. It is a very robust, mature and feature rich framework. ELK is used by large enterprises, government organizations and startups alike. The ELK stack has a very rich and active community behind it. They develop, share and support tons of source code, components, plugins and knowledge about these tools freely and openly.\nIn organizations large or small – there is tons of data produced by various applications running across the enterprise. The decision makers and other business stakeholders require timely access to information in a digestible format – so that they can run the organization in a meaningful and efficient way. Kibana provides such functionality out of the box. It integrates seamlessly with ElasticSearch and provides a very easy to use and visually appealing way to explore our data.\nIn this course, we will focus on this enterprise data visualization tool – Kibana which is one of the core components of the ELK stack. We will look at the overview and explore the technology that goes behind this tool.\nKnowledge and experience about ELK and Kibana could be very valuable for your career. The latest stats and figures show some incredible numbers like jobs requiring these skill sets pay higher than most of the jobs posted on public job boards within the US and annual salaries for professionals could be as high as $100,000. That is the exact reason why you must enroll in this course and take your career to the next level.\nAs the title suggests – this course aims to provide you enough knowledge about ELK and Kibana so that you can build useful visualizations based on your data using these components together. But specifically:\n\n\nYou will get familiar with the features and benefits offered by Kibana.\nSince this course provides detailed demos of installation and configuration of Kibana; it will equip you well for future use of this technology.\nThe more equipped you are, the more sought after you will be.

Moving to private clouds is another step in the data center evolution, where existing infrastructure will be utilized and upgraded to provide cloud-based services. In addition, public cloud services are getting huge market momentum as more and more companies are migrating their applications to 3rd party cloud providers. Public clouds are now leading companies to new business frontiers.\nBasic Skills for Everyone – cloud computing and cloud services is touching almost every corner around us, whether you are a software developer, IT professional, system administrator, IT manager, solution architect, project manager, marketing manager, product manager, sales engineer, security expert, network expert, students entering the IT world and so on.        Level 1 – we need to start with something so this is the first course in a larger training program (“Getting Started with Cloud Computing”) dedicated to the important subject of cloud computing. The training program is divided into several levels enabling students to start from scratch and grow their knowledge step by step or maybe select a specific level according to their knowledge and experience.\nWould you like to join the Cloud Computing Revolution?",

From there, we move on to applying the VLOOKUP function in different contexts—starting with simple lists, and then progressing to more advanced uses such as looking up data across multiple sheets and even across multiple workbooks. As you advance through the lessons, you'll also learn how to combine VLOOKUP with other powerful Excel functions to perform more complex tasks.\nTo get the most out of this course, we highly recommend downloading the included exercise files and practicing along with the tutorials. I always tell my students that learning Microsoft Excel is like learning to drive a car—you can’t really learn it by just watching; you have to get behind the wheel and try it yourself.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be confident, capable, and proficient in using the VLOOKUP function effectively in your daily Excel work.",

      "description": "What makes this SAP C4C course unique?\nIn this course, I'll take you through a learning journey from somone who has never worked in SAP C4C to someone who is equipped to work in a C4C project in the functional capacity. The short and to-the point lectures in this course range from starting to know basic navigation and features in C4C, setting up your SAP C4C tenant, the base configuration and all the important concepts including usability and productivity features, business configuration, master data setup, user and access management, workflows, data workbench, business analytics and lifecycle management. This course has both theoretical units for basic understand, but mostly demo units for a practical understanding of the functionalities in SAP C4C on the tenant. I must mention that throughout this course, I've also shared my experiences of business requirements that I have come across and how C4C functionalities have met those requirements. And that is really important to know for a real understanding of C4C and especially, if you are going into a C4C job interview.\n\n\nHow will you benefit from the course?\nBy the end of the course, you will be ready to serve a role as a C4C Functional consultant diversifying from your current skill and cracking your C4C interview. Don't forget - Interviewers are not looking at just people who are willing to learn new things but looking at people who've already acted, and spent efforts learning C4C even without any project experience. I've taken 100s of technical interviews myself and I know why I'm so particular about this fact.\n\n\nIs the system access included?\nThis is a self-paced online course with lifetime access to training lectures, demos and other resources. The system access does not come along with this course, however, I have helped many students who reach out to me via social networks like LinkedIn with the access. And since access is user license based, it comes at a separate cost and is NOT included in the course.\n\n\nCan I learn C4C without system access?\nThe answer is obvious. Unless you're purchasing the course only for a high level overview of the C4C as a product, I would strongly suggest that you complement your learning on a system with some hands on to make the best use of this course. You may choose to buy system access only after completing 50% of the course, if not at the beginning, but it is recommended that you spend time practicing at least the basic configuration on an actual system rather than just watching and learning.\n\n\nKnow your Instructor\nHi, my name is Sahil Arora and I'm very excited to have published this course to help you with your learning journey. I've 14+ years of experience in SAP CRM and SAP C4C implementations. I made my move from SAP CRM to SAP C4C not by waiting for a project opportunity, but first my proactively learning C4C on my own and then earning that project or job opportunity. I've never been willing to risk spending 1000s of bucks and I just haven't found it worth spending that much. Well, I wish I had this course to Fastrack my move and avoid some struggles in a very affordable way. I've also expanded my learning by coaching and guiding many consultants without any formal course. And I've always thought how could I impact more learners and importantly, in an affordable way, without spending my time with each one of them again and again. And this is the course in an online format that solves that problem.\nI've also already received a great feedback about this course so far. And I plan to keep adding more lectures for either an even better understanding of C4C or to expand the knowledge areas within C4C depending upon which topics need more focus and detailing. But I'm so happy that I've made a great impact already.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? ACT by enrolling NOW. That first step of enrollment is the MOST IMPORTANT step.",

      "description": "In this course, I'm going to teach you how to use the ggplot2 package of R to draw amazing charts that are able to communicate what your data has to say in the most polished, professional way.\nMy name is Clara and I am a Complex Systems researcher and Data Visualization professor at the University.\nCurrently, ggplot2 is the best, most powerful tool for building professional graphics. First, because this is a package available in R, which is one of the most used programming languages for Data Science and related fields. So, it is very convenient to be able to produce graphics in the same environment where you already do all of your calculations. Second, because it is the most flexible tool to build graphs. So, even if you don't use R for your analyses, it is worth it to use ggplot2 to draw your plots, because there's no other tool that will give you the results that you can achieve using ggplot2.\nRight now, the top agencies for Data Visualization are using ggplot2 to present their data. But still, ggplot2 is a tool that not everybody knows how to use, because of its long learning curve. Because of this, some people turn to other tools, like for example, Microsoft Excel, a tool that is not genuinely made for Data Visualization purposes. So, why don't you take the amazing opportunity of learning ggplot2 now and standing out from the crowd?\nWhen I started learning ggplot2 some years ago, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of functions and parameters, and also, I had never used R at the time. But I knew there wasn't any other comparable tool out there. So, I decided to learn it from the grounds, which took me a while! Of course you can watch some tutorials, and learn how to do certain kinds of plots, but I soon realized this wasn't enough to use ggplot in an independent, confindent manner. This course that I'm offering to you today is the course that I wished had existed when I was learning ggplot2. It would have saved me hours and hours of reading books, manuals, the documentation, and endless trial and error.\nIn this course I've followed a methodology that has proven to work over the years with my students at the University, which is: to truly master ggplot2 you need to learn its core: the grammar of graphics. But, learning this alone might be a little tough, so I've created a series of lessons that first cover a certain part of the grammar, and then we move on to learning how to draw particular plots. Both of these types of lessons are fully hands-on, so you won't be bored one second! Using this method, I've had great success with students that had never used R before, R beginners, and advanced R users.\nI really encourage you to make the decision of starting to learn ggplot2, it'll be a skill that you'll use for years to come and which will make a great difference in your career. I promise you won't regret it. Actually, this is what my students say: \"This is the best course on R that I have done (M.G)\", \"This is a perfect course, might be the best I've seen in a long time (A.M)\", \"[I thought] that it was impossible for me to learn ggplot2 but this course showed me otherwise (M.N)\". Take their advice and join us!\n*This course covers the ggplot2 3.3 version (the latest release).",

Note that this does assume knowledge of some basic IT fundamentals, which in most cases would have been gained whilst at 1st line technician level.\nWhilst this will, of course, vary between different organisations, this is based on my own experiences of some of the key things that can go a long way to making that move, along with becoming as familiar as possible with your organisation's processes, I wish you all the best of success in your career.\n\n\n* Brief introduction to the course and the contents\n* Day in the life of an infrastructure technician\n* An overview of hypervisors and their function\n* Introduction to virtual switches - how they tie into hypervisors, etc\n* Incident management fundamentals - managing incidents\n* Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RPOs)\n* Escalation processes - when to escalate an issue to a higher level of the support process\n* Threat monitoring - identifying threats\n* REPADMIN and DCDIAG utility overview\n* SYSVOL folder basics - replication overview\n* Data protection fundamentals\n* Backup types - incremental, differential, full and synthetic full\n* SAN Storage Overview - basics of storage area networks\n* Overview of the most common RAID levels used for backup purposes - RAID0, RAID1, RAID5 and RAID6",

As an added bonus, this training will show how you can add other GIS products (i.e. commercial GIS software) into the enterprise stack as GIS clients.\nIn this course you will create an Enterprise GIS that includes vector and raster data for a mid-sized municipality. You will learn how to add users, each with different permissions for accessing and editing data, and also how to use PostGRES to control all aspects of database access, presentation, and editing. You'll even perform simultaneous multi-user editing on the same GIS layer, and learn how a true Enterprise GIS can manage many users at once.\nAs a bonus, you will see how you can access all the GIS tools from outside of the software by using python to create a table-top GIS application that you might find at a kiosk. And finally, I will show you an example of how the same data in the enterprise can be simultaneously displayed on the Internet using FOSS4g software.",

Powershell GUI's also allow you to share your tool with delegates on your team or in your business, who may not be as comfortable working in a Powershell console environment.\nIn this course we look at the basics of GUIs, with recommended tools and concepts advocated by industry leaders and authors such as Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks. You have what it takes to make GUIs, and our aim in this course is to equip you with the basic skills, and inspire you to go forth and make your own GUIs for your awesome Powershell tools!",

      "description": "VLOOKUP is probably the most used function in excel. This course does just one thing - Demystify how VLOOKUP works in excel. We cover the following aspects of VLOOKUP.\n\n\nWhy use VLOOKUP\nVLOOKUP is used to cross-reference data. There are many situations where data in one sheet or tab needs to be cross referenced to extract values out of it. For example, say we have 1000 students data in a sheet. We want to find out the grades of 100 students among them. Other than doing this manually, what else can we do ? VLOOKUP is a way to automate this function so that we can extract all the information in one go , automatically using a simple formula.\n\n\nHow VLOOKUP works\nThere is a specific way in which VLOOKUP works. The parameters used in VLOOKUP are confusing initially. This course will make you understand the formula along with the parameters with simple examples and with simple data sets.\nApproximate vs Exact Match\nSometimes you  need to match ranges instead of exact numbers. For example, in the same students data, how would you match grades (like A or B) to absolute numbers ? That's when approximate match comes in. We will see how to do approximate matches with sales commission numbers.\nHLOOKUP\nVLOOKUP stands for Vertical LOOKUP. Although, this is the most used function, Excel also provides functionality to lookup horizontally. Data typically doesn't tend to this kind of lookup in real life, but nevertheless, we will cover HLOOKUP.\nSQL Equivalent of VLOOKUP\nIf you understand SQL, we will look at how VLOOKUP is an equivalent of a particular version of SELECT statement that you will be aware of in SQL. If you have no knowledge of SQL, you can ignore this part.\nCommonly occurring problems.\n#N/A error\nNumber as Text\nVLOOKUP works left to right only\nLookup is case insensitive\nNamed Ranges\nIf you use a particular excel sheet a lot repetitively, using named ranges can be very helpful. We will explore how named ranges can be created and used in VLOOKUP. This makes formulas look less ugly.\nVLOOKUP in Google Sheets\nVLOOKUP functionality is provided in Google sheets as well. In this quick chapter,we will look at how to use VLOOKUP in google sheets.",

As demonstration after demonstration will unfold, we will refactor this entire application, one function and one class at a time. During refactoring, many design patterns will fit into place almost without effort.

Here’s what some of my recent students have to say about my teaching style…\nJames S: Very detailed information about the software and industry. A great way to level up GIS skills.\nMark L: …Your presentation was excellent, and I understood your presentations, and if I didn't get the process the first time, it was no problem going back and reviewing the section. I look forward to applying what I have learned to my map-making. I also look forward to availing myself of more of your training.\nJonas V: All the steps are well explained and easy to follow. Good audio and practical examples.\nJohn F: Excellent. Especially as you talk us through all the nuts and bolts, what they mean and what they do instead of just assuming we know - we don't - or at least I don't!! Thanks.\nChristopher D: I came in with ArcGIS background and wanted to learn the open source side of things. I found the course to be very helpful.\nBryan T: Definitely a good start for anyone planning to learn QGIS for the vary first time. Instructions were very clear too.\nMark F: Good intro class for a beginner GIS user. I'm very quickly realizing the power of using GIS as a tool for many different applications.\nAndré S: Well structured and explained course. Provide a short but complete overview of the technical and conceptual bases of GIS analytics. Some complementary documents and above all a thorough e-book on QGIS provide an extra value of practical learning.\nKarin K: Excellent course for beginners like me. I enjoyed being led through the QGIS interface, being introduced to the relevant functions, being able to try out myself, and at the same time getting a profound theoretical background. I especially liked that you discussed the geographer's approach and emphasized how important it is to keep thinking about what you are doing.\nAll the techniques and concepts I teach in my QGIS tutorials For Beginners series have been proven in the research and consulting environments over the last 24 years.\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nQ. Your QGIS tutorial does not use ARC. Does this matter?\nA. No, it does not matter. I teach you the basics of GIS mapping in a way that’s applicable to ALL GIS software, even Arc.\nQ. I have no experience with QGIS. Does that matter?\nA. No previous GIS or QGIS knowledge is assumed.\nQ. I am worried that this QGIS tutorial will be like many other technical courses - abstract and hard to follow.\nA. All exercises are deliberately based on the practical GIS problems that I encounter day-to-day in my GIS consultancy. All my QGIS tutorial for Beginners courses use datasets covering the same area - Yarmouth in Massachusetts. That means my QGIS tutorials build on each other so you get to understand that the value and usefulness of maps over an area increases as more maps are added. Download the teaching datasets and follow-along with the videos.\nQ. What Work Materials are there to support the QGIS tutorial?\nA. Two eBooks with screen captures and explanations to compliment the videos, and so you can follow along, zip files containing the same teaching datasets I use in the videos.\nQ. Do I need to purchase software to do this QGIS tutorial?\nA. No, there is no need to purchase software. We’ll use the FREE QGIS 3. I show you how to download and install this.\nQ. I want to buy this QGIS tutorial today, but I don’t have time to do the course right now. How long do I have access to the course for?\nA. You have Unlimited Lifetime Access to the course (including future upgrades)\nQ. What if I decide this QGIS tutorial is not for me.\nA. I offer an unconditional, no-questions-asked full 30-day money-back guarantee!\nQ. If I have a problem, can I ask questions?\nA. Yes. I welcome questions. I enjoy helping my students.

      "description": "I was stuck in a job I hated and wanted a better paying career in industrial automation. PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming seemed very intimidating and I didn't think I was smart enough.\nEven though I had learned some things about PLC programming from a theory perspective, I didn't have enough knowledge to be successful. I felt stuck like I would never be able to make it.\nThen I started asking for help from an experienced programmer who seemed to make everything look so easy. He was programming these complex systems and I remember thinking \"How does he even know how to program this stuff? It seems so hard!\". He sat down with me and explained that even though I had learned some theory, I needed to start programming the RIGHT way and he was going to help me get there.\nOver the next year, he would give me projects to work on. He would give me his example code as a starting point and explain why you had to program things a certain way in this industry. He had years of experience, years of trial, and error to reference back on. He knew what worked and what didn't, and that's what I was missing.\nI implemented the techniques he showed me, and within just a few short years I went from going nowhere in the automation industry to being the lead automation engineer of a facility that produced millions of dollars of product per day, with over 100 PLC's on-site!\nI compiled all of the techniques and other advanced skills I have learned from working as a controls engineer for 15+ years now and recorded those techniques on video.\nHi, my name is Robert Simons. I am the founder of PLC Training Academy. Today, I’m excited to announce that those videos I recorded are ready for release and are available online here on Udemy.\n\nI call it, The 10 Day PLC Programmer\n\nAnd inside, I am going to teach you how to go from just knowing what a PLC is to being able to program PLC's so well you'll make all your co-workers stare in amazement. And you'll get there in just 10 days.\n\n\nHere's What You'll Discover..\nProject-based lectures. We don't just have you follow along. You learn best when given projects to complete. Don't worry though, if at any time you get stuck we always cover the solution afterward\nProgram using real software. We show you how to download free PLC programming software that is used in the course\nReal-world projects. I took over a dozen real-world projects that I have used in the field and turned them into labs, giving you an accurate programming experience\n\n\nHere's what others had to say about the course:\nMan, your course is awesome... the course was 10/10. Unlike typical training of \"this is what you do, and that's all there is to it\" your course was engaging and very easy to follow along… Being able to immediately apply the lesson into a program makes a huge difference… I feel I gained more from [The complete PLC Programming course] than I have at any of the (overpriced) vendor \"trainings\" I've been to in my career.\n-Bryson Pendley, Instrumentation Technician\n\n\nOK so I think this guy is underrated. Love his videos. Simple, easy to follow through and you make it look so easy although it's not so easy lol but thank you Mr Robert!\n-Gloria Solomon\n\n\nI have been programming for over 4 years, and I wish I had this course available when I started. This course would have saved me a lot of time… [The complete PLC Programming course] helps the student develop strong fundamentals for programming PLCs\n-Christian Ramirez, Controls Engineer\n\n\nGreat presentation. The instructor's voice is monotone, however very informative. There are quizzes throughout the presentation for reviews. Also the instructor is very helpful when it comes to providing material and instructions to follow him.\n-Cristhopher Guzman\n\nRobert is an excellent PLC instructor. He put together a highly professional and valuable course\n-Zach Scriven, Industrial Automation Influencer",

The course will start with requirements gathering & end with implementation. In the process, you'll learn how to analyze and design classes, their relationships to each other in order to build a model of the problem domain. You'll also use common UML diagrams throughout this process, such as use-case, class, activity & other diagrams. The diagrams will be created through a free tool.\nLot of emphasis is placed on use cases to capture and manage requirements. Those are subsequently used to enforce OO concepts that produce a reusable design of the system that adapts to change. Finally, the design is implemented & programmed in three different programming languages - Java, C# & C++. During the implementation, you'll learn about the object-oriented concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Hierarchy, Polymorphism, interfaces, etc. All these concepts are explained with examples in all the three languages.\nFinally, all the important concepts are applied in a textual game called Reckless Driver. Consequently, you'll have understood the entire process of Object Oriented Analysis, Design & Programming & you can implement these concepts in your own software.",

This course delves into the complex mathematical algorithms that allow these sophisticated models to process, understand, and generate human-like text. Starting with tokenization, students will learn how raw text is converted into a format understandable by models through techniques such as the WordPiece algorithm. We’ll explore the core components of transformer architectures—key matrices, query matrices, and value matrices—and their roles in encoding information. A significant focus will be on the mechanics of the attention mechanism, including detailed studies of multi-head attention and attention masks. These concepts are pivotal in enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data, enhancing their ability to understand context and nuance. We will also cover positional encodings, essential for maintaining the sequence of words in inputs, utilizing cosine and sine functions to embed the position information mathematically. Additionally, the course will include comprehensive insights into bidirectional and masked language models, vectors, dot products, and multi-dimensional word embeddings, crucial for creating dense representations of words. By the end of this course, participants will not only master the theoretical underpinnings of transformers but also gain practical insights into their functionality and application. This knowledge will prepare you to innovate and excel in the field of machine learning, placing you among the top echelons of AI engineers and researchers",

      "description": "Transmission refers to the network entity that transports bulk traffic between network nodes. This transport is over a carrier, on which everything is packed and stacked.\nParticipants will learn about transport network which can be divided into various layers, such as Access network, Metro Access, Metro aggregation, Core, and Backbone. Briefly,\nAccess network provides the last mile communication from Customer Premises Equipment to the network.\nMetro access network is the one which connects access nodes to aggregation nodes.\nCore network consists of core layer switches. This layer is mainly used to provide interconnectivity among different users.\nA backbone is a part of network that interconnects various pieces of network, providing a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.\nTransmission medium is the mean through which signal is transferred from one place to another. There are two types of media used in transmission medium. These are guided media and unguided media. Guided media are the physical links through which signals are confined to narrow path. Unguided media is the wireless media.\nThere are two type of transport mode which are mostly used. These are Microwave and Optical fiber.\nMultiplexing is used to send multiple signals over a common high capacity transmission media, such as copper or fiber.\nMajor transport technologies that are used in transmission network are:\nPlesiochronous Digital Hierarchy or (PDH)\nSynchronous Digital Hierarchy or (SDH)\nDense Wavelength Division Multiplexing or (D-WDM)\nCoarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing or (C-WDM)\nThese will form good part of the learning content of the overall course.",

It’s a mixture of slides and code so you can “Understand and Practice” at the same time. This way, you learn the theory, and then put it into practice by developing an application step by step.\nIn this course you will develop a Quarkus applications maps and queries different kind of persistent objects to several relational databases. After introducing JDBC, JPA and Panache ORM, you will make sure your development environment is set up, and you will go from bootstrapping three Quarkus applications, developing and refactoring a rich business model, map and query these objects to a Postgres database. The different steps you’ll go through are:\nUnderstand JDBC, JPA and Panache ORM\nUnderstand SQL, JPQL and Simplified Panache JPQL\nUnderstand the differences between Panache Active Record and Panache Repositories\nCheck your development environment\nBootstrap three Quarkus applications:\no POJOs and JDBC with MySQL\no JPA Entities with MariaDB\no Panache ORM Entities with PostgresSQL\nTest and refactor these applications so they have dependencies between them\nMap persistent objects to a relational database (with annotations and XML)\nMap inheritance and relationships\nQuery persistent objects using JPQL and Simplified Panache QL\nExpose data in JSON using REST endpoint with JAX-RS and JSON-B\nHandle transactions\nVisualise data in HTML using Qute templates and Twitter Bootstrap\nUse Quarkus profiles to switch between database\nExecute the application in dev/test/production mode thanks to DevServices and Docker\nAt the end of the course you’ll get a good understanding on how to develop a data centric application with Quarkus. You will be able to bootstrap, develop, package and execute an application that accesses a relational database, but most important, take Quarkus to your next project.\nGood luck for the course, and please reach out if you need any help or if you have any request: I’m here to help!",

This phase ensures our environment is configured optimally for future application development.\nUnderstanding Layered Architecture: Layered architecture is pivotal for the organisation and scalability of our applications. This concept enables us to structure our code in a manner that promotes modularity and maintainability.\nMaven and Its Lifecycle: Maven serves as a powerful tool for project management and dependency resolution. Understanding its lifecycle is crucial for efficient project development and management of dependencies. We can create Spring boot project using Maven or Gradle, so understanding of this, i think is must.\nController Layer Annotations: Get in-depth understanding of annotations such as @RestController and @RequestMapping facilitates the development of RESTful APIs. These annotations provide directives to Spring Boot, dictating the behavior of our controllers. Covered many other annotation like @RestController @Controller @Responebody @RequetMapping @RequestParam @PathVariable @InitBinder @RequestBody\nBean Lifecycle in Spring Boot: In this you will get to know about BEAN and its lifecycle, I have also explained about IOC (Inversion of Control) which manages those Bean.\nYou will get to know about different ways of creating Bean (@Component and @Bean annotation), Different types when bean get created (Eagerly and Lazily).\nJPA\nSecurity\nMicroservices\netc.",

We’re going to clean and normalize the ingested tables to prepare a complete, clean, and efficient data model. From that data model, we’re going to build four projects creating consumption applications for different real-world use-cases. With each of the projects, you’re going to learn something new:\n\n\nWe will build a spreadsheet export for your finance department, where we will explore data modeling and transformation concepts. Since the finance department really cares about the quality of data, we’re going to also learn about how to setup unit and integration tests to maintain high quality.\nWe will create an alerting system for your operational support team to ensure customer success, where we’re going to learn about orchestration best practices.\nSales data upload that can be ingested back to Salesforce, where we will explore advanced extensibility concepts that will allows us to create and follow standardized practices.\nA dashboard directly on Databricks for your product team to monitor live usage. Here we we learn the a lot about observability and data quality.\nThe best part? All of the code that will be building is completely open-source and accessible. You will be able to apply everything your learn here in your real projects.\nOur entire team of best in-class data engineers and architects with tons of experience from companies like Salesforce, Databricks, and Instagram are going to walk you through, step by step, building out these use-cases.",

      "description": "Update April 17, 2017: Two students asked me for subtitles. I removed the auto-generated subtitles and I added right subtitles for every lesson. Also, sound quality has been improved for some lessons. Thanks for your suggestion! Now, every student can follow this course more easily.\nUpdate September 17, 2016: Some of my students asked me for a chat application. So\nI created the application (GUI included) and I added it in chapter 9.\nNow, you can download the application, run it and view the source code. Enjoy!\nUpdate August 4, 2016: Added: quizzes for learning reinforcement.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nStudent Testimonials!\n★★★★★\nThe best course ever on udemy , it teaches student not only the how to build network application but also discuss all programming topics like streams , thread that involved on building network applications ,the teacher explains while he is coding every step in details , and explain why he prefered this method over that method . Mr. Catalin provides detail answers for any question in quick time . Take this course and you will master building network applications\nRashed\n★★★★★\nProfessional and up to the point. It tells the beginners every single step about Java Network Programming which is very nice. It makes the difficult things look easy.\nSobhan N.\n★★★★★\n\nExcelente curso, esta muy bien explicado y la sintaxys del codigo es muy clara, solo me gustaria ver streaming de audio en tiempo real.\nJuan\n\n\nCourse Description\n\nWith over 45 videos this online Java training course is designed to provide a solid foundation in Java network programming and network communication.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLearn something new\nNetwork programming is one field which everybody uses but is still considered an advanced topic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Source Code\n\nAll source code shown in this course is also available for download. Students can create their own projects using the downloaded java files.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCombine theory with practice!\n\nEach chapter has an intro video to cover basic theory needed to understand the rest of the material covered.\n\nIn the first chapter you will learn the concept of network communication from the very basic fundamental level that needs to be understood by everyone.\n\nTwo other chapters are included in this course for those programmer who haven’t worked yet with java threads or java IO. These two are very important topics when you want to build a network application and I want to ensure that all students have the basics before we start to code Client – Server applications.\nIn the Socket (Java Socket programming) section you will start to write simple TCP servers or TCP clients. Also, you will learn how to create a multi-user or a multithreaded server and we are going to test each written application. We will connect multiple TCP clients to a multithreaded server and we will observe the TCP server behavior and how it makes to respond to multiple clients at the same time.\n\nIn this chapter I will cover some other important network programming topics:\nScan a remote host for open ports\nGet network interface hardware information\nValidate an IP address in different ways\nPing a remote host address using java code\nBrowse internet using java code.\nWeb scrapping – get what data you want from a web page\nUDP chapter focus on the difference between the most used Transport Layer protocols: TCP and UDP. We will write together an UDP server and an UDP client. The interesting part of this chapter comes after we will run the code. The next chapters present some useful applications:\nSend an email\nTransfer files between a server and a client using TCP sockets\nA small web browser.\nThe code is explained in details, line by line. All the needed theory is presented in the application intro and we will test each application after the source code is explained.\n\n\nSo let’s start the interesting journey now!\nCheers,\nCatalin Baba",

But, you don't have any idea how to even start systematically prepare for the system design interview? Then this course is for you!\nThis course is taught by an experiences senior software engineer who landed a job in big tech just after going through the same as go you through right now.\n\n\nOnly a minority of developers today own a computer science degree, many more are \"self taught\" or boot camp graduates. Many feel intimidated by the system design interviews of big tech as topics large-scale architecture and design patterns you will barely learn from day-to-day coding experience.\nThis course allow to catch up and learn enough system design fundamentals to get through the interview, without drowning students in endless theory lessons.\n\n\nIncluded in the course fee is your access to a private online community to find fellow students to discuss system design question and find a sparring partner for mock interviews!\n\n\nIn this course you will learn the following:\n\n\nThis course covers all commonly discussed systems!\n\n\nI help you to understand what's the expectation and take you on a deep-dive into all commonly discussed systems within the system design interview.\n\n\nNetflix\nYoutube\nAmazon\nDropbox\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsapp\n\n\nLearn the interview structure hands-on!\nFor each system we walk through the entire interview structure together step-by-step:\n\n\n1. Functional Requirements Engineering\n2. Non-Functional Requirements Engineering\n3. Capacity Estimations\n4. Data Model Design\n5. System Design\n6. Component Design\n\n\nAll Technologies, Architectures and Patterns are explained, no prior experience needed!\nWe will draw each of these real-world systems and discuss all design choices made. I introduce all technologies, architectures and patterns we come across:\n\n\nMicros Services\nLoad Balancer\nServers & Clients\nDatabases\nMessage Broker\nMany More\n\n\nDrill-down to Component Level Design\nThe course is intended to go beyond covering the bare minimum of knowledge to barely pass the interview. I cover enough depth so you feel confident to handle any bar raiser question your interviewer might come up with. That's why we will down the the component level design to make sure you have some backup knowledge to shine with!\n\n\nDisclaimer: This course is applied!\nYou won't be asked to just lean back and enjoy the show. I leverage Excalidraw, the great collaborative white board tool to draw to help you actively follow the course, make up your own mind about each design and draw it the way you believe would be best!\n\n\nWho is your Instructor?\nI am an experienced instructor with more than 10.000 taught students on Udemy alone. I am also a senior software engineer working in big tech. I have gone through the same interview process myself and I also conduct interviews from the other side of the table. Moreover, I design system architectures on a daily bases.\n\n\nMy goal is to teach you everything it takes for you to master your system design interview with confidence and ease!\n\n\nYou don't have to be an expert in any of it to get started!",

It covered many aspects of SQL Server not just SQL syntax and gave practical demonstrations of every subject covered. Brilliant. -- Mr Dave Morgan\n\"A very succinct introduction to the SQL Server transaction log. A must for anyone wishing to understand the function of the transaction log and learn how to explore its contents within the space of an hour or two.\" -- Stylianos\n\"Great\" -- Richard\n\"The explanation was very simple and easy to understand.\" -- Mansoor\n\"Very good forensic procedures.\" -- Thomas\n\"Thanks very much, nice course\" -- Stanislaw\n\"Great explanation and very representative examples.\" -- Roman\n\"I am learning a lot about SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis.\" -- Debora\n\"Concise review of basic SQL premises along with log analysis at current and file levels. Good course.\" -- Mike H\n\"Excellent material and quick to the point!\" -- Nick Y.\nCOURSE INTRODUCTION:\nWelcome to Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis.    In this course, we are going to take a deep dive into analyzing the transaction log.  The SQL Server transaction log contains the history of every action that modified anything in the database.\nBefore data is written or saved on disk a copy or record of that transaction is first written to the transaction log.\nThis is part of the D in the ACID properties. Recall that D stands for durability and durability is the ACID property which guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently.\nFor example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes.   This process in SQL Server is accomplished by WAL or Write Ahead Logging.\nSQL Server uses a write-ahead log (WAL), which guarantees that no data modifications are written to disk before the associated log record is written to disk.\nNo matter what you’ve read about non-logged operations the truth is that every user transactions that modifies an internal SQL Server object is logged.\nIn the course we will learn how WAL works for SQL Srever and some internal architecture on how this is accomplished.\nThanks for your interest in Advanced SQL Server Transaction Log Analysis and we will see you in the course.",

For some reason, Administrators avoid the Salesforce Developer Console like the plague! But it has some really important tools within it that can help you speed up the time it takes to identify issues on the platform as well as running quick calculations on records within your Salesforce org.\nUnderstand how Salesforce thinks\nOne of the most important aspects of this course is to learn how Salesforce works under the covers. By understanding what happens when you create, update or delete records in Salesforce, you can have a greater understanding on why issues crop up and how you can zero in on the issue quickly and get it resolved.\nDebugging & Troubleshooting Salesforce\nSalesforce developers use Salesforce Debug logs a lot to find out what's going on in Salesforce when actions are performed. This section of the course teaches you how to read debug logs effectively so that you can understand why that workflow rule or validation is throwing an error or not doing anything at all! It's all about digging down and finding the issue quickly.\nI also show you how to visualize debug logs in a different way so you can quickly understand whats happening in Salesforce.\nIntroduction to SOQL\nSOQL is a query language used by developers to pull data out of Salesforce to perform actions on it. In this section, you will learn how SOQL relates to reports in Salesforce and how you can use SOQL to quickly get answers to information in Salesforce without the need for creating Record Types or Reports all the time.",

      "description": "It's WORTH your money! This program runs through 6 chapters. This is a self-paced course that suits to your own daily busy schedules. Self-paced gives you the freedom to complete each topic based on your own available time before proceeding to the next chapter without hurry. Basically, I will teach about 6 fundamental topics in Bioinformatics to you. Just to let you know, I don't intend to cover a basic programming class here. Udemy has a lot of great programming courses that can be applied in a Bioinformatics settings. So please well equip yourself with at least Python, Perl, PHP, Java, SQL and R programming. That will really help you to take off faster as a Bioinformatician in the near future. In 6 days you will learn through video lectures and tutorials about:\n\n\nDay 1 - Introduction to Bioinformatics\nWe will start this course with a brief definition of Bioinformatics - what exactly it constitutes of, and the importance of this field in the scientific world. Also, I will share with you the history of how Bioinformatics came into being - the reason why it was coined.\nDay 2 - Bioinformatics Databases\nOne of the reasons why Bioinformatics exists is due to the increased amount of biological datasets. These are huge scientific research outputs that need to be managed. In this chapter you will learn first of all how data is stored and manipulated. Subsequently I will begin to introduce to you about nucleotide databases. Bioinformatics is all about managing data and providing scientific knowledge. In this chapter we will also  focus on protein databases. These two types of databases compliment each other and both are important for your studies. An example of database that we will be covering here is UniProt.\nDay 3 - Sequence Alignment\nThis is one of my favorite chapters. Have you ever wonder how two sequences are being compared using two different sequence alignment algorithms? Think about aligning 100 DNA sequences at one time - is there a way to perform the multiple sequence alignment? In this chapter I will teach you how to perform Global and Local sequence alignments - it's all about basic concepts of scoring matrices. Let's get serious with Bioinformatics from here onward!\nDay 4 - BLAST programs\nYeaps! Also my favorite! I will teach you how to perform a Local sequence alignment using a Bioinformatics tool known as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment  Search Tool). We will look into both nucleotide and protein sequence BLAST programs and learn how to read and interpret BLAST results in-details.\nDay 5 - Molecular Phylogenetics\nLet's get straight to the point. You are uniquely different and special! If you are a big fan of X-Men and other Sci-Fi Hollywood movies talking about aliens, superhuman, man with extraordinary powers, or even just about how diversified we are - this is the time to pay attention to this module. I will teach you about how species is identified and classified using genetic data. To do that we will also be looking into several types of phylogeny analysis algorithms and construct a tree of life from a specific set of sequences. Don't skip this session!\nDay 6 - Genome Analysis\nIn this module you will learn about a genome. We will look closely into both structural and comparative genomics. The detail parts begin with the sequencing technologies and followed with genome assembly and annotation.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have prepared several sets of quizzes and assignments for you to solve. Based on previous experiences with other students, I am aware that some of you might need a one-to-one discussion therefore you are welcome to request for an online meeting / discussion session with me. Just to help you progress in this course. By the way, the first chapter is F.O.C. for preview! Register now to start learning about what Bioinformatics can do to help you, be it in research routines or for career development or simply just for personal interest. You have a lifetime access to this course and the course materials will be updated periodically. Do check for updates from time to time.",

Healthcare organizations continually face cyber threats, which put patient privacy and safety at risk. These threats also have significant impact on business continuity and financial health of all healthcare organizations.\nIssues relating to Healthcare IT systems and its security were once the sole domain of engineers in the IT department. This is no longer true. Understanding security issues and protecting against them is job #1 for all healthcare workers from the top to the bottom of the healthcare system.\nAdvances in technology have made the whole cybersecurity issue pretty complicated to understand, especially for the average healthcare worker. This class on cybersecurity is focused on the non healthcare professional who is just trying to get a familiarization on what cybersecurity is and how they can protect themselves, their organizations and their patients from harm.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE?\nIn this, the 1st in a 2 part series of courses, you will learn:\nWhat is Cyber Security?\nThe Nature of the Problem\nControlling Access\nSomething You Know (Passwords)\nSomething You Have (FOB)\nSomething You Are (Biometrics)\nAuthenticating Access\nPhishing / Spam\nThis course includes:\nVideo lectures walking you through the various aspects of cybersecurity\nQuiz to test your retention\nSignificant number of resources to do a deeper dive into his topic.\nWHO IS THE IDEAL STUDENT FOR THIS COURSE?\nYou will learn a lot from this course if you are\nThinking about choosing healthcare as a career\nLooking to advance your career in healthcare\nLooking to expand your knowledge of healthcare to better perform your current job and better understand how it fits into the ecosystem of patient care and better serve those in need\nCurious about everything and want to learn more about healthcare just for the sake of expanding your knowledge base.\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING STYLE?\nMy teaching style is a very pragmatic one. I assume you know nothing about this topic and start with the foundation and build from there. Some of these concepts could be challenging, so I sprinkle in as many examples as I can, both non healthcare and healthcare, to assure full understanding of the topic. This is why I have appended \"Plain and Simple\" to all my courses.\nWHY ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE?\nI spent 35 years in the designing and launching of medical imaging products and services. My career evolved from leading engineering teams, to becoming VP Marketing and then to president of a Healthcare IT firm. It is also based on 15 years of university teaching.",

If you are new to PostgreSQL then no worries as the course starts with the fundamentals of PostgreSQL.\n\n\nHands on with AWS\nExperience with any RDBMS\nBasic Unix shell scripting\nOpen to learn\nCourse outline\nCourse is divided into multiple sections. Each section starts with a lesson titled \"Section Objectives\". To gain a better understanding of the topics covered in the course, please check out the first lesson (preview) in sections of your interest.\n\n\nFundamentals of PostgreSQL\nAurora Architecture deep dive & cluster setup\nMonitoring features and tools (CloudWatch, Enhanced Monitoring, Performance Insights ..)\nDesigning highly available, and scalable clusters\nCluster configuration management\nQuery performance tuning\nAurora Postgres Security\nEffectively using Aurora features such as Global Database, Serverless, Cache management\nAurora Disaster Recovery\nBackup Recovery\nCluster management tasks such as vaccuming, analyze, explain etc.\nWhy I built this course?\nAurora is complex and architecturally very different from the databases available in the market. When I started to learn it, the biggest challenge was the non availability of Aurora specific information. The only source of information is the Amazon Aurora documentation website which in my humble opinion is not the most effective way to learn. It took me quite sometime to wrap my head around Aurora's architecture and features; the tutorials in the documentation involve manual steps, mostly on the console, as a result they are not easy to follow. Long story short, for folks new to Aurora (& Postgres) learning Aurora can be daunting.\nBased on my personal experience with learning Aurora Postgres, I decided to put together this course to help others get up to speed with Aurora in minimum possible time. So if I have to describe in one line, why I built this course  - \"It is to accelerate students learning\".\n\n\nDisclaimer\nCourse content developed using publicly available sources such as AWS documentation & blogs\nOpinions/views expressed in the course are my (Rajeev Sakhuja) own and does not reflect opinions/views of my employer or Amazon/AWS",

      "description": "The Kotlin Multiplatform Masterclass by Petros Efthymiou.\nLearn how to build native iOS and Android apps while sharing the infrastructure & business logic.\nAre you following dozens of forums and articles and buying courses in order to move your development skills and career to the next level?\nI am, too, but more often than not, after completing them, I realize that there is still a HUGE amount of work left to be done to connect all the pieces together and make them work on an actual production application. I found that even though a course was providing comprehensive knowledge on networking with Ktor, it didn't combine it with Clean architecture, dependency injection, or a local DB with SQL Delight. And because another course was extensive on SQL Delight, it was missing the rest of the best practises.\nAfter buying courses, reading articles & forums, and getting my hands dirty, I combined the KMP best practices in a single course to build an actual production application together.\nI created this course to make the process easier for you! You are going to learn how to combine:\nKotlin\nCoroutines\nJetpack Compose\nSwiftUI\nKtor\nKoin\nSQL Delight\nKotlin State Flow\nClean Architecture\nMVI\nAnd complete actual Android & iOS applications using the industry's best practices\nMy approach is to build an application together that can be copied and used in your actual work.\n\n\nWhy Me?\nI am a seasoned Mobile engineer, author, and Instructor with more than 10 years of experience. I have been working as a Mobile engineer from junior to lead positions in ambitious startups & large multinational companies since 2013. Being a sound engineer, though, doesn't automatically mean that you are an excellent instructor.\nIn my lifetime, I have trained hundreds of thousands of developers in classrooms, web conferences, video courses, blog posts, and books.\nAmong other things, I have created a best-selling Android Udemy course called Android TDD Masterclass. I have also written a best-selling Amazon book, Clean Mobile Architecture, which has prepared thousands of mobile developers to become mobile architects.\nFurthermore, in the past 7 years, I have delivered countless courses, seminars, and lectures in institutions, including New York College and Hellenic American Union. My current position is as a Mobile Trainer in a Multinational company called Backbase, where I am training\nThe internal RnD engineers\nThe internal professional services engineers\nExternal third-party integrators\n\n\nWhy is it important?\nKotlin Multiplatform is now considered stable and ready to be used in Android production applications.\nUnlike all other cross-platform applications with KMP you can rip the advantages of both native and cross-platform solutions. KMP gives you the option to build native UIs using Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI while sharing all the business logic, infrastructure, and boilerplate code.\nGoogle and Apple don't sit still; they are in a constant innovation race. They keep coming up with new UX guidelines and UI components that shape the industry and user expectations. All the past cross-platform solutions could not catch up and eventually became deprecated. With KMP, you can leverage the native innovation while also significantly reducing the effort.\nFinally, KMP delivers on the promise of using it \"as-much-as-you-want\". You can truly use it for the whole application or just for a new feature module without any complications.",
