      "description": "About This Course\nAre you the kind of person who learns best by doing? Do courses with just Power Point voice-overs leave you cold? If so, then this course is for you, because the only Power Points you'll see are in the introduction and end of class lectures.\nIn this course offers 14+ hours and 73 videos of lab task demonstrations - the equivalent of attending a 5-day vSphere 7.0 Boot Camp course at a fraction of the price. I'll show you how to build, configure, administer, run, scale vSphere 7.0. I'll also show you how to deliver better than 99.99% service availability.\nThis course consists exclusively of 100% Hands-on Lab demos videos of a real VMware vSphere 7.0 installation. I'll take you from first-principles (powering on a new server) to a completed, working Compute Load Balancing / Storage Load Balancing / Failure Recovery cluster and everything in between.\nI've organized this course into Sections - that focus on the most important vSphere 7.0 features. Each Section has one or more step-by-step Hands-on Lab demo video(s)... with voice overs to explain what I am doing and why I am doing it. I cover best practices, things to watch out for, issues / concerns, bugs in VMware's software and much more.\nThere are 6 free-preview lectures (first lecture of Sections 1-6) offering over 70 minutes of free content. I encourage you to watch these lectures to see if this course is for you. You also get our free sample vSphere 7.0 Boot Camp Lab PDF ebook.\n\n\nHow to Use This Course\nIf you are new to vSphere or are wondering how all of the vSphere pieces fit together, start at the beginning and see how it's done. If you are more experienced, jump to the Section that covers exactly what you need to know.\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you can use it for many purposes:\nLearn how to install, configure and administer a complete, working vSphere 7.0 system\nUse individual lessons to learn how to do specific tasks (perhaps before you do them at work)\nCompare what I've done in my environment to your environment to see if there are vSphere features that you could be using\nReview your installation. Is it well designed and well implemented? Is it configured consistently? Is it scaleable? Is it redundant?\nThese are critically important questions. Use this course to get the answers\n\n\nWhat Does This Course Cover?\nBasics: ESXi, vCenter installation, configuration\nNetworking: Introductory, advanced vSwitch networking, jumbo frames, pNIC teaming, dvSwitches\nVirtual Machines: Build, configure, right size, deploy, VMware Tools snapshot, hot-plug vHardware\nRapid VM Deployment: Guest OS Customization, cold clone, hot clone, rapidly deploy\nStorage: NFS, iSCSI, VMFS, Multipathing, Capacity Mgt, Raw Device Maps, Content Libraries\nAdministration: ESXi and vCenter permissions. Infrastructure monitoring with Alarms\nCompute Resource Management: Resource Pools, Cold Migrate, VMotion, Storage VMotion, DRS clusters\nMaximize VM availability: vSphere High Availability clusters, Fault Tolerant protected VMs\n\n\nHow Will This Course Benefit You?\nIf you are new to vSphere 7.0\nSee tasks in the order they are normally done\nSee how to do each task, step-by-step\nExplanations as you go help build knowledge\nIf you are experienced with legacy versions of vSphere\nSee how to complete 73 tasks in vSphere 7.0 using VMware's updated interface\nLearn about new vSphere 7.0 features and capabilities\nIf you are an experienced vSphere 7.0 administrator\nUse this course as a vSphere 7.0 how-to-do-it reference guide\nGo directly to advanced topics that you need to learn now\nReview / refresh yourself before you perform tasks in production\n\n\nYour Ultimate vSphere 7.0 How-to Reference Guide\nGo to any section whenever you need to review or brush up on your skills on how to get the job done. See exactly, step-by-step how to complete each task. Note the best practices, tips or pitfalls I explain while I'm taking you through each task.\n\n\nCaveats\nThis course includes all of the lab recordings of our Mega Course - VMware vSphere 7.0 Boot Camp Parts 1, 2 and 3. If you have already purchased those courses, you do not need to purchase this course.\nThis course does not include access to live labs.",

      "description": "It is important for you as a network engineer to learn Linux!\nWhy? There are many reasons including:\n1) A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. I'll show you an example using Cisco, Arista and Cumulus Linux.\n2) Network Automation tools such as Ansible don't run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools.\n3) SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, RYU and APIC-EM run on Linux.You will find that many SDN tools require Linux.\n4) DevOps tools such as git work best with Linux.\n5) IoT devices typically run Linux\n6) A new breed of network devices from companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Cumulus Linux use Linux.\nThere are even more reasons, but make sure you don't get left behind! You as a network engineer start learning Linux.\nThis course teaches foundational Linux knowledge without assuming that you have any Linux experience. Learn practically with GNS3!\nLearn how to configure Linux networking, how to create users and assign permissions, how to install and run Linux services such as DNS and DHCP.\nThe course uses various GNS3 topologies with devices such as:\n1) Linux Docker containers\n2) Linux GNS3 QEMU virtual machines\n3) Traditional Linux virtual mahcines\n4) Network devices - you could use Cisco, Arista, Cumulus Linux or others\nDo you want to see something else added to the course? Just let me know. I like to get your feedback on ways I can improve the course and add more content that you think is relevant.\nNetworking is changing. Make sure you keep up to date!\nAll the very best!\nDavid",

So learning the macOS command line can accelerate your studies or career, giving you radically new skills you never imagined.\nYou donât need any previous experience. If youâre comfortable using macOS desktop and basic tools such as Finder, or even if youâre new to Mac but familiar with other systems such as Linux or Windows, then youâre ready to take this course.\nYou'll start with the basics, and by the end you'll be able to perform some advanced tasks that would impress most professionals.\n\n\nWhat Youâll Learn, in Detail\nYouâll start with the very basics of what the Terminal actually is, how it relates to the rest of macOS, and the huge benefits of learning the command line.\n\n\nFrom there youâll see how to launch Terminal, how to understand the user interface, and how to run your first commands such as ls.\n\n\nThen youâll be introduced to the file system and youâll learn how to navigate around using the command line using cd.\n\n\nYou'll be introduced to paths and learn the difference between relative and absolute paths\n\n\nYouâll learn to work with files, creating, copying, moving and deleting files and directories.\n\n\nYouâll learn how to view and edit files directly in Terminal using cat and nano. You'll also learn a little about vi and vim, and why they're not the best for a beginner.\n\n\nYouâll learn the basics of pattern matching so you can work with wildcards and search tools such as grep, which will make your workflow much more efficient.\n\n\nFinally youâll learn about I/O streams and redirection, and very powerful tools such as pipes and command line filters so you can sort and reorganise files and other data.",

      "description": "Search Algorithms and Optimization techniques are the engines of most Artificial Intelligence techniques and Data Science. There is no doubt that Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing are the most well-regarded and widely used AI search techniques.\nA lot of scientists and practitioners use search and optimization algorithms without understanding their internal structure. However, understanding the internal structure and mechanism of such AI problem-solving techniques will allow them to solve problems more efficiently. This also allows them to tune, tweak, and even design new algorithms for different projects.\nThis course is the easiest way to understand how Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing work in detail. An in-depth understanding of these two algorithms and mastering them puts you ahead of a lot of data scientists. You will potentially have a higher chance of joining a small pool of well-paid AI experts.\n\n\nWhy learn optimization algorithms as a Data Scientist?\nOptimization is getting popular in all industries every single month with the main purpose of improving revenue and decreasing costs. Optimization algorithms are extremely practical AI techniques in different projects. You can use them to automate and optimize the process of solving challenging tasks.\n\n\nWhat does anyone need to learn about optimization?\nThe first thing you need to learn is the mathematical models behind them. You cannot believe how easy and intuitive the mathematical models and equations are. This course starts with intuitive examples to take you through the most fundamental mathematical models of all both Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. There is no equation in this course without an in-depth explanation and visual examples. If you hate math, then sit back, relax, and enjoy the videos to learn the math behind Neural Networks with minimum efforts.\nIt is also important to know what types of problems can be solved with AI optimization algorithms. This course shows different types of problems as well. There will be several examples to practice how to solve such problems as well.\n\n\nWhat does this course cover?\nAs discussed above, this course starts straight up with an intuitive example to see what a Hill Climbing is as one of the most fundamental AI problem-solving approaches. After learning how easy and simple the inspiration and algorithms of Hill Climbing are, you will see how it performs in action live.\nThe second part of this course covers terminologies in the field of AI Optimization. In the third part, we will work with you on the process of designing Simulated Annealing using Hill Climbing. In the first three parts of this course, you master how the inspiration, theory, mathematical models, and algorithms of both Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms.\nIn the last part of the course, we will implement both algorithms and apply them to some problems including a wide range of test functions and Travelling Salesman Problems.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing and able to easily use them in your project. You can analyze, tune, and improve the performance of both techniques based on your project too.\n\n\nDoes this course suit you?\nThis course is an introduction to optimization and search in AI, so you need absolutely no prior knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or data science. However, you need to have a basic understanding of programming preferably in Matlab to easily follow the coding video. If you just want to learn the mathematical model and the problem-solving process using the two algorithms, you can then skip the coding videos.\n\n\nWho is the instructor?\nI am a leading researcher in the field of Optimization and AI. I have more than 150 publications including 100 journal articles, five books, and 20 conference papers. These publications have been cited over 15,000 times around the world. I was named as one of the most influential researchers in AI in 2019 by the Web of Science, the most well-regarded indexing organization in academia.\nAs a leading researcher in this field with over 15 years of experience, I have prepared this course to make everything easy for those interested in AI search and optimization.

Most of production systems have been built on top of legacy, monolith technologies. Recent popularity of micro-services will not fulfill its promise of decoupled, scalable and fault-tolerant systems, unless \"done right\". While entering the world of micro-services, engineers start building distributed applications, where robust remote procedure calls and cluster coordination are a must.\nIn this course you will learn about common challenges that appear while designing and implementing large scale distributed systems, and how Big-Tech companies solve those problems.\nTechnologies, algorithms and design patterns covered in this course:\nService Registry and Discovery, Service Mesh\nApache Cassandra\nETCD (coordinator managing Kubernetes clusters)\nApache Kafka\nIdempotent service design, retry logic\nSharding and Consistent Hashing\nClient-side Load Balancing, Distributed Tracing, Canary Deployment, Sidecar Pattern, Circuit Breaker\nCourse will teach you the principles of various distributed systems design, for example master-less vs. with leaders, poll-based vs. push-based, immediate vs. eventual consistency. After completing the course, learning new distributed database technology would be easier, because you will know the common re-used techniques, including their pros and cons.\nMy intention is to keep course content very practical, with lots of code examples and applied best practices. For example, IÂ will cover Service Registry and Discovery to the detail, that you will know how to implement your own framework on top of ETCD. Throughout the course, we are going to build distributed URL shorten service.\nThe course may be a good recap for people preparing for systems design interview.",

Tmux provides an alternative.\nBecause of the flexibility it brings to you as Linux user. An entire Linux system can be controlled from one command line (as long as that command line is attached to a tmux session). Files can be edited in vim, emails sent from mutt, and irssi is always there when you need to get some social media postings out.\n\n\nWho is this for?\nThis is a Linux beginners course. It makes working with the Linux terminal easier.\nIt is very useful when you use the Linux terminal. Instead of annoying tabs or different graphical windows, tmux lets you easily working with the terminal. You can use it over an ssh connection too, so you don't need multiple connections to work with the remote connection.",

It makes your job application or freelance bid stand out from the crowd in a positive way.\n\n\nIt makes you a better sysadmin. You can be a good sysadmin without knowing how to code but if you aim to be great at Linux, then you must know how to code C. Most Linux software (and most of Linux itself) is written in C. If you want to understand the system in depth, then learning C is your best option.\n\n\nIt improves your general knowledge of computers. In order to write advanced C code you must understand the hardware. C is very connected to the hardware. There are no classes or objects or any other filtered layers between you and your hardware. You manipulate the RAM directly with your pointers and you execute kernel system calls in direct contact with the operating system. By learning advanced C, you learn to understand the OS and your computer's hardware.\n\n\n-Why learn C from dr Jonas Birch and not from the other ten Udemy instructors?\n\n\nExperience in the C language. When dr Birch was 18 years old and had been coding C for five years, he was traveling all over Europe, invited to different coding and security conferences, giving lectures about C and security. Since then he has coded C almost every day - for an additional 20 years!\n\n\nExperience in teaching. Dr Birch has been teaching the C language (live) almost full time the last six years, helping hundreds and hundreds of students learn the mother of all languages - in Linux.\n\n\nVery soothening voice and amazing sound quality. Dr Birch has a very dark, relaxing voice which is very easy to listen to (a really underestimated feature). He is recording in a professional recording studio with enterprise level microphone and equipment, which makes for a very good listening experience.\n\n\nEnroll Now or try out the free sample lectures.",

      "description": "Windows Deployment Services (WDS) server is no longer optional for any highly qualified IT administrator, if you are responsible for administratingÂ several workstations, you must learn to WDS as a primary service for Windows deployments.\nWhy? Good question. And the answer is clearly visible if you check the curriculum of this course, you can see the benefits of having WDS to help you manage and maintain all your Windows images in one store, your server.\nSo what makes WDSÂ that useful for us?Â WDS works as a multi-purpose service, if you only said it's used to deploy images, you are telling a part of the truth, a minor part to be honest, with WDS, you can maintain your images, meaning that you can keep all your images updated periodically to include latest updates and service packs, you can have a WinPE images that help you troubleshoot problematic machines, you can automate installing drivers for your hardware whenever you deploy an image to a machine, you can create your reference image which will save you tens of wasted hours in getting your machines ready to be used, you can also automate the deployment process using XML answer files! Let's get a little deeper and see what this course covers...\nWe will start from scratch, with a brand new server, so if you're totally new to this technology, that's absolutely fine, we will learn how to add WDS role to the server, complete the initial configuration, and explore the WDS console to have an idea about what we are going to discuss in the course.\nIn the second section, we will see a common case that causes some kind of problems for system admins, having WDS with DHCP in the same server, why it causes a problem, and how to configure WDS & DHCP properly so you don't get yourself in trouble doing that.\nAfter that, the real stuff will begin, we will start adding our images to the server, we will cover different types of images and what's the difference between them, boot, install and discover images, we will see how to add hardware drivers to our WDS so they get installed automatically to our deployed machines, and we will see if our configuration will work when we boot a machine to network? (Hopefully!)\nThe following section will dedicated to cover creating reference images (they refer to it as: standard, master, golden, etc.), you can call it an \"ideal image\", it will have your operating system, applications, updates, files, and settings included in one image, maybe you're thinking now, so what should I do after installing that image to a machine to make it ready-to-use?! Nothing.\nThere will be some different minor topics that are going to be covered in the extra section, and in the bonus section, we will see how to create XML answer files to automate the installation process (And yes, you can add this automation file to your reference image, so you get a ready-to-use device with zero human intervention)!\nTo get the best learning experience, every single step we mentioned here is appliedÂ practically, all the videos are recordings of my screen, where we will apply what we are discussing, boring readÂ texts have no place here in the course.\nSo if you have read all that, you are now confident that you need to learn all these stuff, along with many tips included in the lectures to make it very beneficial for you, enroll now, and let's start.",

With these tools, you can backup, recover and protect critical business VMs.\n\nLearn how to Backup and Replicate Virtual Machines\n\nThis course covers two major topics that all vSphere 6 vCenter administrators must know:\n\nFirst, we look at how you can use vSphere Replication to select and hot replicate critical Virtual Machines to ESXi hosts either within your existing vCenter environment or to a remote vCenter environment (your Disaster Preparedness site). Periodic hot VM replication will help you successfully cope with an IT Disaster by regularly duplicating selected VMs to your remote site. Should an IT Disaster occur, you can use vSphere Replication to selectively restore critical VMs, boot them up, put them back into service to restore critical business functions. We will look at how to install the vSphere Replication appliance, how to select VMs for replication, replication policies like Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). We will also see how to restore replicated VMs and place them back into service.\nNext we look at vSphere Data Protection - VMware's hot Virtual Machine backup and recovery tool. We will see how to install and configure the vSphere Data Protection appliance, how to create backup jobs, how to set backup retention policies and how to verify that backups are running correctly. We will see how to perform Virtual Machine Recoveries - both in place (overwriting the original VM) or to a new target location. We will also see how to perform an Emergency VM Recoveries (when vCenter is not available) and how to use the self-service File Level Recovery portal to allow VM administrators to recover individual files and directories. We will also see how to perform management tasks on the VMware Data Protection appliance.\nThe skills you will acquire in this course will help make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.\nAdded Bonus! This course is 100% downloadable. Take it with you and learn on your schedule.",

This training will help you achieve your OSCP, how to prevent Privilege Escalation, and how to perform them, too. Privilege escalation happens when a malicious user exploits a bug, design flaw, or configuration error in an application or operating system to gain elevated access to resources that should normally be unavailable to that user. The attacker can then use the newly gained privileges to steal confidential data, run administrative commands or deploy malware.",

Everything will be built in AWSÂ and will be mostly in the free tier!Â We will start from the basics of Ansible to deploy Jenkins, then use Jenkins to deploy deployments created in Terraform and Ansible in a completely controlled way that allows us to manage errors and issues we may encounter along the way.\nYou will not only learn how to create deployments, you'll also learn how to manage those deployments within Github and setup a Gitops pipeline that can be used to deploy all sorts of great projects in the future!\nSo join the course today and let's get started!Â You'll find that the skills learned within this course can be applied not only to existing tools taught, but any other tools as well. Since most tools follow the same DevOps methodologies, these skills are transferrable and useful at most organizations you would want to work for!Â Nearly all major companies in the world use some or all of the tools in this course, so you can know these tools are useful. And most new tools that come out are based on these tools, so even if they're different, you'll find that they're still useful!\nI hope you enjoy the course and feel free to reach out to me any time!Â As you can see by my other courses, I am extremely personally responsive (not just a bunch of assistants) and am always happy to help!",

It solves certain problems, although it is not a solution for ecerything.\nWhen using microservice, complexity shifts, and mindset change required. Technical challenges will arise and must be addressed. Fortunately, many people already facing the same technical challenges and developed a solution. These solutions become common patterns to solve thes problems. Thus, it become design patterns for microservices architecture.\n\n\nThere are many patterns to design and implement microservices.\nMicroservices is -by nature- distributed system, thus some technical challenges comes from this nature. Communication among services in distributed places require different approach to works efficiently. In this course, we will learn many things :\n\n\nwhat is microservice architecture\nmicroservice chassis to boost productivity\norganize clean & standard microservice code\ncommunication among services : synchronous, asynchronous\nservice discovery\nhandling communication error\nsynchronize data & keeping data integrity on transaction which involves several distributed services\ncapture changed data in real time, in reliable way\nquerying data from multiple services\nevent sourcing, replaying data flow\nAPI gateway concept\ncomposing several API\ncache\nmonitoring services\ntracing call chain that involves several services\ncentralized log & exception tracking\ndeploy the application as docker container\n\n\nThis course will be delivered with full sample code using Java Spring Boot & Spring Cloud.\nSeveral other tools that we will use on this course :\nApache Kafka (will use a lot of this!)\nMySQL\nDebezium\nDocker\nHashicorp Consul\nHashicorp Vault\nElasticsearch\nLogstash\nKibana\nZipkin\nKong API management\n\n\nImportant!\nThis course uses Spring Boot version 2.x.\nOn late November 2022, Spring Boot 3.0.0 released.

      "description": "At the end of this course - starting from your ROS1 knowledge - you will be able to create complete ROS2 applications, and migrate a ROS1 code base in ROS2.\n! IMPORTANT: If youâre a complete beginner and have no ROS1 knowledge at all, please donât take this course. You must know how to work with core concepts (nodes, services, parameters, launch files) to understand the course.\n! UPDATE - PLEASEÂ READ: the ros1_bridge + migration part is not so relevant anymore, as the ros1_bridge project was not really completed, and it looks a bit abandoned (unfortunately, no alternative). I'm still leaving the course open for enrollments, because the first 4 sections are still very useful.\n\n\n-- Why this course?\n\n\nWell, if you already know ROS1, you might want to start learning ROS2, but not from scratch.\nOr if you have to work with a ROS1 project, you might be looking into a way to port it to ROS2.\nI myself was a ROS1 developer before learning ROS2. What I was looking for was simply some documentation of how I could quickly get up to speed with ROS2, as I already knew ROS1. I didnât find any good resources, so I had to go through all of the beginner documentation for ROS2. After doing all that, Iâm now using ROS2 and I can see the differences. In this course I wonât start from the very beginning of each ROS concept, since you already know them. Iâll just focus on the most important points that will allow you to write ROS2 applications in no time, thanks to your pre-existing ROS1 knowledge.\nAnd I understand the need to know what to do with an existing ROS1 project, now that ROS2 is starting to get bigger and more stable. So, again, what Iâll teach you is what I personally do with my own projects. I donât âinventâ a method, I create it from real practical needs I have and other people have.\n\n\n-- How do I teach?\nMy method is quite simple:\nStep by step\nGoing to the point\nPractice over theory, though a little bit of theory doesnât hurt when combined with practice\nMy experience with Robot Operating System is very practical. I actually used it to build a robotic arm that is now on the market. So I had no other choice than being practical and going to the point. And thatâs the way I want to teach you.\n\n\n-- What will you do in the course?\n\n\nThis course is divided into 2 main parts.\n1. First, youâre going to learn how to write ROS2 programs, using your ROS1 experience. Weâll start from an existing ROS1 application, and step by step, weâll go through every core concept and see how to translate the app in ROS2. Note that we wonât dive into advanced functionalities, weâll stick to the ROS2 core functionalities.\n2. Then, itâs migration time! If you already have some basics in ROS2, you might go quickly with the first part, and then focus on this migration part.\nI will explain to you:\nWhen to switch to ROS2.\nWhich ROS1 and ROS2 distribution to use now and in the near future.\nI will give you a step-by-step process to migrate your ROS1 code base in ROS2. Also youâll see how to run a ROS1 application along with a ROS2 application, communicating between them thanks to the ros1_bridge package.\nAnd finally: a complete project for you to practice on migrating a code base and writing ROS2 code. Iâll give you a project I made with Turtlesim in ROS1, and youâll migrate it to ROS2.\nNote: once again, for this 2nd part of the course, unfortunately the content starts to get outdated, as the ros1_bridge development didn't go through, and there is no alternative to that. The first part is still relevant.\n\n\nThis course is not for you if:\nYou donât have any knowledge in ROS1\nYouâre already an expert in both ROS1 and ROS2.\nYouâre just getting started with programming and Linux.",

      "description": "O Ghosh !!Â I just cannot shout-out more how important TIMERS are in almost all applications or projects. Timers are used to schedule events to be triggered or fired in future. How have you been doing this till now ?\nTimers Use case Scenarios :\n1. Firing One time future Event : Delete something after 100 seconds\n2. Firing Repeated Regular future Events : Send packet to machine X after every 5 seconds\n3. Periodic Waits : Try something 5 times at an interval of 3 seconds\n\n\nHow would you design a timer ? Â  PETÂ Question for interview. So better prepare for it.\n\n\nAbout this Course This is short project based course, yet important course to cover Data Structures and Algorithms involved in designing efficient timers.Â  We shall be using C as a programming language, but you are free to use your favorite programming language. This course is Programming language agnostic.\n\n\nCourse Pre-requisite\nIf you can code in any programming language, that suffice.\nYou should familiar with basic data structures such as linked list and function pointers.\nBasics of Multi-threading\n\n\nAlso, Please just do not sit and watch my codes. Write your own codes, even if it is same as mine !\n\n\nNo Third Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch. This course do not suggest taking help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course. However, it is recommended to use third party libraries for commonly used data structures such as linked lists/Trees/Queues etc which saves a lot of time implementing these data structures.\n\n\nWarning : This course has auto system-generated subtitles which may not be perfect.

      "description": "About This course is about Developing your own Remote procedure calls - I will use Linux OS for this course, however you can use Windows OS if you are used to it.Â  The essence and real strength of this course is No use of any third party libraries. I follow this principle in all my other courses. Whatever you learn through my courses, you learn from absolute ground level. This course does not violate the principle and teaches you how to build Remote Procedure Calls step by step from absolute scratch - No framework, tools, supporting libraries or anything - just pureÂ C.\nThis course actually lays the foundation of many future System Software Projects. Few of which are below and is a part of this course curriculum.\nRemote Procedure Calls (RPC) is a technique to invoke the function/procedure which actually resides on different physical machine running somewhere else in the network - hence the name remote procedures. In this course, you will learn the concepts working behind the scenes. The same concepts can be extended to implement other system programming concepts, besides RPC, such as - Data Synchronization andÂ Check-pointing the application state.Â  This course promise to deliver the complete content on developing RPCs in its initial release.\nData Synchronization - It is a process to synchronize the complete application Heap state to remote machine. The remote machine will build the mirror heap state. In the event, the first machine fails, the remote machine can take over as it has all the state required to resume the operation of failed machine.\nCheck pointing - It is a process of saving the application Memory state to disk/file persistently, so that, the application can be restarted/resumed any time building the exact same Memory state from Memory snapshot stored earlier to secondary storage.\nCheck pointing shall be delivered in subsequent releases of this course.\n\n\nWho should do this courseÂ ?\nBeginners Please take this course at your discretion. You should be good with C pointers and how C objects are laid out in memory. I expect you to be at-least above beginner level in C programming. This means, that only very enthusiastic students who wants to get an edge over the smartest student in their college should enroll. Average students Pls excuse. Job seekers and professional developers Must enroll. The concepts you learn from this course is language agnostic and having learned them will enable you to implement the RPC/Data-Synch/Checkpointing in any programming language of your choice. If tomorrow you happen to work in Java, you shall be knowing how RPCs work at the lowest level of implementation.\n\n\nPre-requisite\nC and being good at pointers is a pre-requiste of this course. A minimal socket programming back-ground is desirable but not mandatory. We designed this course starting from absolute basics and building the foundation of learners first before actually pulling the course at full throttle. If you are not good with pointers and memory manipulation in C, Pls enroll only after meeting the pre-requisite criteria.\nAlso, Please just do not sit and watch my codes. Write your own codes, even if it is same as mine !\n\n\nProgramming Language used In this course :\nWe have a strong reasons to choose C as a language for this course:\nRPC is a technique which if knowing the concepts can be implemented in any programming language of your choice. Learning RPC using C helps you understand what is going on behind the scenes. C language really exposes the low level details about how system actually works. In System programming, C is the only language to be used and there is not even a remote substitute of this language when it comes to System programming.\n\n\nNo Third Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch, beginning from #includeÂ <stdio.h>. This course do not suggest taking help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course. However, it is recommended to use third party libraries for commonly used data structures such as linked lists/Trees/Queues etc which saves a lot of time implementing these data structures.\n\n\nRelatedÂ Courses\nRPC is one way of carrying out Inter Process Communication between two processes running on separate machines in the network. You may also want to check my another course in which Linux IPCÂ techniques has been discussed.\n\n\nWarning : This course has auto system-generated subtitles which may not be perfect. Please disable subtitles as per your convenience.\n\n\nCurriculum\nThis Course is divided into two major parts -\n1. Understanding the Concept of Serialization and DeSerialization in great detail\n2. Using the Serialization and DeSerialization to actually solve/build system. This includes :\nBuilding Remote ProcedureÂ Calls\nState Synchronization\nCheck pointing the application state\nSection 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are dedicated to build up the base on thoroughly mastering the concept of Serialization and DeSerialization.\nSection 7, 8, 9 are dedicated to build and develop above stated systems\n\n\nSection 1 - Get Started\nTable Of Contents of the Entire Course\nLinux Installation for Beginners\nSection 2 - What is Serialization and Why we need it ?\nSection 3 - Concept of Data Serialization and DeSerialization\nSerializing and DeSerializing Simple C Structures\nSerializing and DeSerializing Nested C Structures\nSerializing and DeSerializing Pointer C Structures\nSection 4 - STREAMS - A Data Structure\nDesign and Implementation\nSection 5 - Data Serialization and DeSerialization Implementation in C\nSerializing and DeSerializing Simple C Structures\nSerializing and DeSerializing Nested C Structures\nSerializing and DeSerializing Pointer C Structures\nAn Example\nSection 6 - Serializing Generic Data structures\nUse Function Pointers to Serialize void *\nSection 7 - Implementing Remote procedure calls from Scratch\nUnderstanding RPC Concept and Design\nDeveloping Client Stubs - Marshalling of RPC Arguments\nDeveloping Server Stubs - UnMarshalling of RPC Arguments\nDeveloping Server Stubs - Marshalling of RPC Return Type\nDeveloping Client Stubs - UnMarshalling of RPC Return Type\nConcept of RPC Identity\nRPC Use Cases\nSection 8 - State Synchronization\nSection 9 - Checkpointing (Coming Soon)\n\n\n**Audit Trial **\n30 Sept 2018 - Added Section 8 on State Synchronization\n29 Sept 2018 - Added Section 6 on Serializing Generic Data structures",

      "description": "Youâve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth Operating System course series online. With over 2700 students enrolled and hundreds of 5 star reviews to date, these comprehensive operating system tutorials cover everything youâll ever need.\nWhether you want to:\n- build the skills you need to get started with computer science\n- move to a top notch software company like google by cracking their interview questions on operating systems.\n- get a top grade in semester exam\n- or just learn computer science to be able to understand on how to build better apps.\n\n...this complete operating system series is the course you need to do all of this, and more.\n\nAre you aiming to get your computer science degree with high level of expertise in core subjects ? or Are you aiming to get placed in a a top notch company like google, microsoft ? or Are you a college student struggling to understand the basics of computer science ? or Are you a software developer who would want to develop better apps by understanding the theory behind computer science ?\n\nThis course is designed to give you the operating system skills you need to crack the interview questions on operating system in top notch companies. By the end of the course you will understand Operating System Concepts extremely well and be able to start with any subject of computer science.\n\nLots of students with no zero knowledge of computer science have been successful with their college exams or interview by taking this course.\nHere are some examples of students who found this course to do wonders for their college exams or interviews or software jobs.\n\"thank you , i finished the operating system course in the college with a good grade 85\" by Moamen Medleg\n\"His way of explaining complex concept is Great. I started to understand little bit that this is base for all programming language. I have around 12 years of IT experience. Hope OS learning should be mandatory to all before starting their career in IT\" by Happy.\n\"Very good explanation of all the learning materials. He is unlike many other instructors who just throws things out to you expecting you to absorb the things that are being thrown at you. He is someone who explains things in a manner that is understandable and absorbable even to O/S beginners with only limited knowledge or background in O/S. Two thumbs up from me! Thank you so much!\" by Mike\n\"I really enjoyed this course. Instructor made it seems like he is standing there and wouldn't leave the screen until the concepts gets into your head. So much engaging and wherever he says, we will see this later. He make sure you will. I totally recommend\" by Surbhi Vasudeva\n\"excellent course i had started with 0 knowledge now i had learned so much best lecturer super planning of schedule\" by Harshavardhan Gupta\n\"I really enjoyed the course and the instructor provided a great overview of the fundamentals of the theory behind operating systems. In case you are confused, the course is theoretical as opposed to a walk through of how to use Windows, Mac, etc. Instead, he provides an overview of the algorithms used to move processes from RAM to the CPU. I look forward to Part 2\" by John Simons\n\"Great, very detailed course. Ideal for non IT-educated students like me\" by Michal Burdzy\n\"Great Teacher. Takes concepts slow and repeats definitions and meanings multiple times so there is no need to pause the video or rewind it to hear a definition. Uses this practice to reinforce the material in your mind and ensure you actually learn it rather than hear it\" by Sam Debois\nThe course series (part 1 to 4) on operating systems is a whopping 46 hours long. Because the course is designed as a one stop shop for Operating System Concepts. And this 46 hours dedication will change your way of thinking towards computer science.\nWhy would you choose to learn Operating Systems ?\nThe reality is that there are a lot of computer science subjects out there. It's in the hundreds. Why would you choose the operating systems subject?\nThe reason is starting most of the subjects of computer science will become far more easier if you have a good understanding of operating systems. By learning this subject you are not only getting started with operating system but also getting started with computer science.\nWhat textbook should I follow ?\nI have used operating system concepts by Galvin. Its a great textbook. You can follow it. But I have referred lot of other textbooks like Tanenbaum, William Stallings, etc. So its upto you on which textbook you are comfortable with but follow a standard author book. If you complete this course, you will find it much easier to understand these textbooks. But anyway if you complete this course with good detailed notes, you don't need to read any textbook as I am reading them for you and giving the contents in an easy to understand manner.\n\nWhy should you take this course?\n\nIt's been a best seller since it's release on Udemy, you would be joining over 2700 students who are already enrolled in the course.\nThere are close to 500 reviews left by students. It's rated as the best course to learn operating system for beginners.\n\nWhat makes this course a bestseller?\nLike you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with incomplete Youtube tutorials which assume you already know a bunch of stuff and also bulk textbooks able to send even the most intuitive person to sleep.\nLike you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics and all-round confusing info presented in the wrong way. Thatâs why so many find success in this complete Operating System course. Itâs designed in a simple manner so that anybody with no prior knowledge of operating system/computer science will be able to understand.\n\nWhat if I have questions?\nYou can ask questions anytime using the Q/A section or through personal messages. I take it very seriously and answer these questions in a detailed manner with simple english words so that anybody can understand it.\nStudent Quote: âEverything you always wanted to know about OS but were afraid to ask\"...And Vignesh Sekar gives the right answersâ by Claus Kaliba.\nThereâs no risk either!\nThis course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let me know and Iâll refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.\nYou either end up with Operating System skills, learn other core computer subjects, get placed in top notch companies or research areas or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you donât like itâ¦\nYou literally canât lose.\nReady to get started ?\nEnrol now using the âAdd to Cartâ button on the right, and get started on your way to computer science.\nSee you on the inside (hurry, Operating System Series is waiting!)",

We will first have a detailed look in various questions that a Linux beginner always face before getting started. After that we will learn to install Linux in virtual box or VMplayer so that your windows or MAC remains still available for you. Unfortunately, if anything goes wrong, you can just uninstall the software and reinstall it.\nFurther, we will then explore basics of Linux like file system, basic commands and permissions. Linux file system is bit different than windows, so a Linux user must understand about file structure and permissions to execute the scripts that we will learn to create in this course.\nFurther we will move to shell scripting part and explore the basics like variable declaration, basic operation and conditionals. In the latter part of the course, we will learn about various loops and loop control keywords.\nLinux is very easy to use operating system but the reason it sounds bit intimidating is that you have to learn few basic commands. But things have changed now, Linux can also run completely on the Graphical User interface too. The cool visual effects in Ubuntu and fedora have become a reason for many kinds to get started with linux.\nHere are some facts about linux:\nÂ·Linux nominated as worldâs second most secure operating system after OpenBSD, which is UNIX based. For eg. The super computer takes about 5 years to break the password of the root user.\nÂ·Linux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes in the last decade due to pricing.\nÂ·Some 95% of the servers used by Hollywood's large animation studios are powered by Linux.\nÂ·Google runs its web servers on Linux.\nSo, lets get started with your first linux class.",

      "description": "SQL Masterclass: From Absolute Beginner to Advanced Query Expert\n\n\nThis course is a complete, step-by-step journey that transforms anyoneâfrom absolute beginner to confident practitionerâinto a production-ready SQL developer using MySQL.Â  Every concept is explained, demonstrated, and immediately practiced inside the MySQL Workbench so you see results in real time.\n\n\nThe curriculum is broken into four progressive phases:\n\n\nPhase 1 â Foundations\nYou start with nothing more than curiosity.Â  We install MySQL together, tour the Workbench, and learn what a database truly is.Â  Youâll master every DDL statement (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME) and understand when to use each one.Â  Next we cover every MySQL datatype in depth: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT and BIGINT; FLOAT, DOUBLE, and DECIMAL for exact money calculations; CHAR vs VARCHAR vs TEXT for strings; DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and TIME for temporal data.Â  You practice inserting data three different ways (implicit, explicit, and bulk) and learn safe UPDATE and DELETE patterns that never break referential integrity.\n\n\nPhase 2 â Data Integrity & Modeling\nReal databases must enforce rules.Â  We cover PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT, and AUTO_INCREMENT constraints with hands-on labs.Â  Youâll normalize sample datasets then denormalize selectively for performance.Â  A mini-project asks you to refactor an existing schema so it passes all normal-form tests while remaining practical.\n\n\nPhase 3 â Query Mastery\nYou now write powerful SELECT statements.Â  We teach the exact SQL execution order so you understand why WHERE filters before HAVING.Â  You aggregate data with GROUP BY, filter groups with HAVING, and sort with ORDER BY.Â  We then turn to relationships: you diagram 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many scenarios, then implement them using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER joins.Â  Self-joins (employee-manager) and cross-joins (reporting matrices) are demystified.Â  Sub-queries and derived tables are compared side-by-side so you know when each is optimal.Â  Youâll calculate the N-th highest salary in two different ways without ever hard-coding values.\n\n\nPhase 4 â Production & Performance\nThe final phase makes you production-ready.Â  You create parameterized stored procedures, handle errors with SIGNAL/RESIGNAL, and deploy triggers for audit trails.Â  You learn transaction control (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT) and user security (GRANT, REVOKE).Â  Indexing receives special attention: clustered vs non-clustered, B-tree vs hash, plus full-text and spatial indexes.Â  We build a banking database project that stores accounts, transactions, and loan records, then optimize it until complex reports run in milliseconds.Â  Finally, you explore window functionsâRANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG, and LEADâto produce executive-level dashboards without leaving SQL.\n\n\nKey Differentiators\nâ¢ Zero-to-hero pacingâno prior experience required\nâ¢ 100+ hands-on exercises with downloadable starter scripts\nâ¢ Real-world banking project carried from design to optimization\nâ¢ Interview-style challenges at the end of each week\nâ¢ Lifetime access, captions in multiple languages, and responsive Q&A support\n\n\nBy the final lecture you will confidently design schemas, enforce data integrity, write complex analytical queries, optimize performance, and secure a MySQL databaseâskills immediately transferable to Mysql, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, or any other relational system.",

      "description": "NEWSÂ FLASHÂ - Please read as of 6/24/2020\nYou asked for it, and we listened. So now you got it!! We have just updated the course with nearly 3 1/2 hours of NEWÂ videos. Now you can update SCCMÂ to version 1910 or the latest 2002. And much, much more to come!\nIf youâve made it to this page, chances are youâre currently at SCCM Noob status (or are at least unfamiliar with the latest version), and you need to upgrade your skills FAST.\nYouâre either:\nAlready a Windows sysadmin who just had a newly installed SCCM server dropped into your lap, and now you have to figure out how to work it properly\nAn IT professional whoâs recently been promoted into a role where âCongrats!â youâre now in charge of getting SCCM deployed for your entire organization (even though you have zero experience with it)\nWorking with a client and an SCCM install is part of your project scope, but youâve never done it before\nExperienced in SCCM 2012, but your organization has decided to move to a newer version of SCCM, and you need to know whatâs changed and how the new features work\nOr just simply an IT enthusiast looking to add another technical proficiency to your resume\nRegardless where youâre starting from, the consensus is in:\nThe worst thing you could POSSIBLY do is jump into an SCCM production environment without understanding how to use it. Hang around sysadmin forums long enough, and youâll hear the horror stories of re-imaging 1,000s of machines incorrectly and burning your businessâs infrastructure to the ground.\nThankfully, that type of âgloom and doomâ is incredibly rare. But the point remains: you need to find some effective SCCM training to get you up to speed before you jump in.\nThe problem is, most SCCM courses are books do more talking than showing, leaving you with a rough idea of what SCCM can do and how to use it... But mostly just half asleep at your desk, and still confused when you go to actually implement it.\nWe did something different.\nWith System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) For Beginners weâve built the entire course around establishing a working test lab on your laptop and walking you through a real, functioning ConfigMgr environment.\nOur goal is to teach you the fundamentals of SCCM as quickly and painlessly as possible, so that you can walk away from this course with the ability to deploy and administrate SCCM as soon as youâre done.\nAfter taking this course youâll be able to:\nInstall and configure SCCM from the ground up including downloading and installing the latest SCCM, SQL, and all of the necessary server roles and schema\nUse the Configuration Manager Console, including managing users, creating boundary groups, and user discovery methods.\nCreate and push out applications to the Windows PCs on your network to the appropriate users (plus how to monitor whether itâs progress and any errors that pop up)\nDeploy an Operating System to a machine on your network, without worrying about making an âOMG what did I do?â type mistake\nIntegrate Endpoint Protection with SCCM to prevent network security threats and keep your users safe\nUpdate Configuration Manager to the latest version.\nAnd overall, administrate the latest version of SCCM like a pro\nAll with easy-to-follow, high quality videos and downloadable reference PDFs.\nNo more scrolling through Microsoft forums trying to figure out which features apply to the latest version of SCCM, and which are outdated...\nNo more trying to decipher the âadvancedâ language youâll find in SCCM communities online. That stuff may make sense to them, but boy is it rough for beginners...\nAnd no need to attend expensive in-person training or trying to read through dense SCCM books that are filled with vast âwall-of-textâ explanations and only a sparse screenshot here or there...\nYou can work at your own pace, watch us work through each configuration screen and pause where you need to, and youâll have lifetime access to the material once you register.\nBut donât just take our word for it though. Hereâs what just a few of our IT students say about our courses:\nâGreat course! Paul and Robert do an amazing job here. Highly focused and straight to the main concepts, no fluff!âÂ ~ Chris Vazquez\n\"Paul is a great instructor. The examples shown are easy to understand and follow. Love it.\"Â ~ David Murvai\nâI picked this course due to the topics it covers but also the reviews that have been left and I have been very impressed with everything Paul has provided...âÂ ~ Graham\nâVery detailed course. Paul isn't boring and keeps you engaged throughout the course. I learnt some very important skills that will push my career forward. Thanks Paul!!âÂ ~ Kevin Nedd\nPlus, in addition to the core course content, youâll also get:\nSection follow-up quizzes to test your comprehension. What youâll learn in the course wonât âstickâ unless you make sure youâre not just watching and âthinking,â but putting your knowledge to the testâ¦ so we built that right into the course itself.\nDirect access to the course instructors (Paul and Robert). You can ask questions and discuss the course content and how to deploy SCCM within your specific application.\nContinually updated course content. We routinely amend and update the course content in response to your feedback and questions, as well as SCCM updates, so if thereâs something else youâd like us to cover just ask!\nA certificate of completion that you can put on your resume, show to your manager, and join the ranks of the SCCM administrators community... Something that could go a long way towards earning you a promotion and more job security.\nSo if you're ready to go from SCCM Noob to Expert in short order, you can instantly join the course today.\nThe best part about it?\nYou get a rock solid 30-day money back guarantee. So you can quite literally take the entire course, implement what you learned, and if you're unsatisfied for any reason whatsoever, request a full refund with no questions asked. Zero risk on your part.\nAll you have to do is click the green âBuy Nowâ button at the top right of your screen, and you can instantly access the course in under a minute.\nHope to see you inside!",

      "description": "LITESPEED vs APACHE vs NGINX\n84x the performance of Apache | 12x the performance of nginx\nIf the above statement is not enough for you to seriously consider hosting your WordPress sites using LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS), then you can also consider the following:\nCaching is one of the most important aspects of improving WordPress performance. With LSWS, you wont be using a third party caching plugin, you will be using the best ALL IN ONE PERFORMANCE plugin currently available. LITESPEED CACHE for WORDPRESS. LSCWP is designed to work with the actual web server and to take advantage of the built in performance features that LSWS offers.\nApart from the built in performance features of LiteSpeed Web Server, there are also the security features built into the web server: DDoS, brute force protection, web application firewall and hot linking protection.\nAs these performance and security features are built in, they are easily implemented and without causing any conflicts with the WordPress core. These built in features can easily replace the functionality of 4 or 5 different plugins.\nLiteSpeed Web Server is the future of WordPress hosting. It offers the compatibility of Apache and the speed of nginx when hosting WordPress sites.\nWith the recent data breach of over 1.2 milllion WordPress customers at a certain web host, it's really time you consider self hosting your WordPress sites. Why rely on your host for security? Self hosting is much more secure and the entire process is actually very easy.\nThis course covers the entire workflow of self hosting WordPress sites using LiteSpeed Web Server.\nWe start with a blank slate and layer by layer configure an Ubuntu server.Â  I will teach you, step by step, to a point where you will have the skill, knowledge and confidence to host multiple hardened and optimized WordPress sites. You will need no support from your host. You will be your own system administrator.\nThis course covers the entire spectrum of configuring an Ubuntu based server. We will cover everything from initial server configuration to installing LiteSpeed, MariaDB and LSPHP80. Once installed, we will configure, harden and optimize the various packages.Â  The WordPress sites we create will also hardened and optimized. Then we will move on to installing SSL certificates optimizing the database.\nThe most important aspect of any server is security. I don't just glance over this aspect, every configuration step you will take is geared towards security. Installing a WordPress \"security plugin\" does not secure your server or your WordPress site. Some \"security plugins\" are a source of vulnerabilities themselves.\nAfter security we need to look at optimization. Speed is everything and LiteSpeed delivers WordPress sites at blazingly fast speeds. We will use a varied approach to optimization - from memcached and Redis to the excellent LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin - you can be assured - your page speed scores will sky rocket...\nBy the end of this course, you will be ready to reap the benefits.\nAdd a new revenue stream and start earning additional income hosting your own sites using LiteSpeed. There will be numerous new services you will be adding to your resume as a web developer. You will be able to charge for numerous new services -Â  site hosting, site optimization, Let's Encrypt SSL certificate installation and renewal and even a monthly maintenance fee.\nThis course was not designed to be completed locally, on your pc or mac or using one of the many available \"Virtual Machines\". Oracle's VirtualBox is one example. The aim of the course is to instruct you on how to setup a secure/hardened hosting environment and then host multiple hardened WordPress sites on a commercially purchased VPS or dedicated server.\nThis course is not a lab experiment with no real-world application.\nI want you to able to look at server logs and see how malicious users and bots are scanning your server, probing and looking for vulnerabilities. You need to be able to see the result of your hardening - banning, blocking, rate limiting - in your server logs. This cannot be done in a VM.\nThis course is based on LiteSpeed Web Server and not OpenLiteSpeed.\nAll that's left is for you to sign up for this course and start your wonderful journey as your very own system administrator running multiple WordPress sites on a LiteSpeed based server.",

The purpose of this course is to give a deep overview of what Jails are, and how to use them for building testing or production-ready environments. All this using a great BastilleBSD project.\n\n\nWhat you'll learn:\nCreate FreeBSD lab environment for a safe Jails testings\nGet deeper understanding what Jails are\nMaintain Jails using BastileBSD\nUnderstand Jails networking\nGet some practice with Jails backups\nUse BastileBSD for maintaining multiple Jails environment in seamless way\n\n\nWhat are FreeBSD Jails from Wikipedia:\n\"The jail mechanism is an implementation of FreeBSD's OS-level virtualization that allows system administrators to partition a FreeBSD-derived computer system into several independent mini-systems called jails, all sharing the same kernel, with very little overhead. It is implemented through a system called jails, as well as a userland utility plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day.\n\n\nThe need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider's (R&D Associates, Inc.'s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system â both its files and its resources â in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments.\"\n\n\nTopics covered in this course:\n'Mastering Jails' course covers most of the Jails setup options available and required for running Jails in real live scenarios. The main topics include:\nJails Essentials\nCreating a FreeBSD Lab environment\nUsing BastilleBSD for managing Jails in many different ways\nSetting Jails networking in the right way\nBONUS: Running FreeBSD Jail on Raspberry PI\nDuring the course, we build a lab environment with fresh FreeBSD installation and we setup Jails from the ground to a production-ready environment. We will practice working with Jails, backing them up, or do networking the right way. All this using a great BastilleBSD project.\n\n\nSummary:\nFreeBSD 13.x Mastering Jails course covers various topics related to using Jails to manage running different software packages in a secure way. Using Jails you can avoid security issues/holes in software packages you host on your system.",

For months after getting my A+, MCITP and MCTS windows 7 I could not get an interview anywhere but after taking this course and using the resume template within a week after submitting my resume to several companies I got 3 interviews. Highly recommended. Instructor is great I've watched this course 5 times already.\nby Kurt Schmucker, (5/5) Excellent course\nA very good course, with excellent hands-on configuration of virtual machines (VMs). I can only imagine how tough it must have been to learn these IT skills before VMs became prevalent and so easy to install, configure, throw away, etc. I am learning exactly the items I needed.\nby Robert Martin, (5/5) Nothing that you don't need to sift through to get the gems!\nI love this course! It is concise and to the point giving students the luxury of not having to figure out what the \"important\" tidbits of information are. It ALL is, and that's a refreshing difference from most other online tutorials I've waded through. Thanks for good design and lesson planning!\nby Corey Carter, (5/5) Invaluable\nThere are a lot of courses on udemy with regard to Windows System Administration but I am glad I chose this one. I about 175 days left on my eval copy of windows server and plan to use it to really practice all the things I learned in this course. It is a beginner course and feels like one so if you're at all wondering if you should take it, stop wondering and take it!\nby Travis Coles, (5/5) Great Instruction\nVery practical, easy to understand lectures. The quality is excellent and the instructor's delivery was spot on. I can't wait for the next course.\nby Roshan Ally, (5/5) Awesome course\nThis is an excellent beginner`s course in Windows Server 2012 R2. William explain and demonstrated some important and useful tasks that the sys admin will do. I learn a few things about virtualbox as well. I enjoy following along and do the tasks as well. I now feel more cofident about the Windows Server Operating System. I do hope that William will follow up with intermediate and advanced level courses.\nSee more reviews for yourself below!",

      "description": "WHY HAVE A LOOK ON THIS COURSE AT ALL?\nI worked with several software tools for different tasks within several companies.(Most of them were clients of my own company - a digital business consultancy). Most corporations are facing the same challenges - the better the business, the more employees and the faster the growth; but at the same time processes & internal organization become increasingly complex.\nDue to organic growth all companies face one moment in their history, where they realize, that their digital structure, they once started with causes more problems, than it solves, because it is too static - too small. Or they find themselves in the middle of 30 insular software tools for certain tasks, that need to be connected via APIs to have a useful information flow within the company. This way of building a digital infrastructure is expensive, not transparent, complicated and far away from being stabile.\nOdoo is one of the first All-In-One solutions, which is affordable & still easy to use. The best thing: It can be tailored to meet your companyÂ´s needs.\n2.000.000 Odoo users have the same opinion.\nWHY BUY EXACTLY THIS COURSE?\nIn 2014 I was in charge of finding a new ERP for a German, fast growing company. The solution should include warehouse management, accounting, website & shop plus a smart CRM. I guided the whole process of month of research, data transfer (databank mapping), establishing the system & new workflows in the daily business plus educating the other employees. Today I am working with Odoo on a daily basis and (unbelievable, but true) I still love it.\nWith well structured video tutorials I will teach you how to work with this amazing ERP by showing you the straight functionality of Odoo plus giving you advices on how to apply your knowledge for your own business.\nI hope this course will support you to become a good Odoo user within 14 days. But even more important: You can easily look up functions, you forgot about. You can do so much with Odoo, that it is impossible to keep everything in mind. This course will help you:\nto make a profound decision, if you want work with this system in the future.\nto avoid stress & save time (for yourself or your employees) working with Odoo, if your company is already using it.\nsave money, you would normally spend on training sessions & consultancy.\n\n\nWHY BUY NOW?\nThe will never again be cheaper, than now. The more material I add, the higher the price.\nMy first goal is to compile a solid course with more than 7 hours of compact, effective video coaching sessions. But from that point on I wonÂ´t stop enhancing the course.\nThe earlier you buy, the less you pay.",

        "TECH-AGENCIES, that consider to offer Odoo installations, customization and support to their partners. Here you get a good overview about, what Odoo is able to do and what problems future clients might face. Odoo has over 2 Mio Users (and growing), but there is still only a small number of agencies, who provide Odoo services. This course is a great investment into your future!",
        "EMPLOYEES OF COMPANIES, THAT WORK WITH ODOO ERP, who are fed up with spending to much time on standard processes, because they never received a proper training. Ask your company to split costs on this course - the price is not even a friction of what they lose, when everyday processes take too long!",

The personal cloud is not a tangible entity. It is a place which gives users the ability to store, synchronize, stream and share content on a relative core, moving from one platform, screen and location to another.\"\nThis course is all about. I will teach you in a few simple steps how to create your own personal and secure cloud, at home or at your place of work. The only storage limit is your hard drive, and even so you can extend it easily using network shares or integrate it with already owned commercial clouds. All you need is a spare computer or Raspberry Pi or an Internet connection. You can even build it as a virtual machine on your desktop at home.\nI will teach you to install it the ownCloud software suite, to configure it and manage it. I will explain to you the advantages of ownCloud over Dropbox. Furthermore, I will guide you trough it's functionality and it's interface.\nSo let's start building your own personal cloud.

How do we do that? During this course, you will see hundreds of Linux command-line tools and you will write hundreds of lines for Shell Programming or as some may be used to call it, Bash Programming, so by end of the course, you have built a relatively robust understanding of different aspects of Linux for real life and work projects.\nlong story short: Your learning approach in this course is the same way as you probably learned how to ride a bike! Remember? Even if you haven't, you will learn Linux Command-Line and Shell Scripting (Bash scripting) with us anyway! Just keep do-along with each video and code-along with each project.\nSince different work environments are built-up with different Linux distributions, this course is inspired by LPIC Certificate and therefore is built vendor-neutral, meaning no matter RedHat based, or Debian forked, e.g. CentOS, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, Kali, or even Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), you will learn their differences and will start doing real things in their shell.\nHere is an overall conceptual breakdown of the course:\nSection 1 and 2, starts with the basics of Shell and Kernel, then moves on with preparing the lab environment and Terminal\nSection 3 to 8 builds your ability to understand the fundamental concepts and work with commands on key components of Linux.\nSection 9 and 10 dig deep in key Networking tools, concepts, and commands\nSection 11 is entirely about system visibility using sysdig and csysdig, inspecting the kernel syscalls, and applying their use-cases\nSection 12 is all about Shell Programming. You will learn the basics and start building a scripting mindset by coding along with Projects such as creating a Backup tool and a Password Manager and so on\nSection 13 is mostly useful for Windows users who would like to run Linux applications with the native performance of their Windows machine using Windows Subsystem for Linux\nBy the end of the course, you will have the ability to confidently apply the skills and grounded knowledge you learned during this course in different productive workplaces within divergent computing and ITÂ branches such as Ethical Hacking, ITÂ Security, IT Administration, Cloud Security, Networking, Linux Development, and much more.",

Using the command line, you can perform amazing feats of wizardry and speed, taming your computer and getting it to do precisely what you want. The command line is a text interface for your computer. Its a programe that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. From the command line you can navigate through file and folders on your computer, just as you would with finder on Â MAC OS or windows explorer on windows. The difference is that command line is fully text-based.\nThe advantage of using the command line is its power. you can run programs, write scripts to automate common task and combine simple commnads to handle difficlut tasks - making it an important programming tool.\nIn this course you'll learn the essential tools for feeling comfortable and getting stuff done.\n> how to open the terminal and configure and customize a session.\n> how to compare Finder actions with commands, add functions to the system, and get system information.\n> how to manage the system, find, identify, and manage data, and use Directory services.\n> how to manage profiles and keychains, install packages, and process media with commands unique to Apple.\n> learn about the Apple System Log.\nA programmer who doesn't know the command line is like a writer who can't use a pen. Knowing the command line is essential for really applying almost any programming language today. Sign up for the course and give it a shot.

One for installing subversion server for sharing scripts you have written, and another case study, which will extract information from web server(Apache) logs and put them into a database (mysql).\nAnd every section will have an exercise video full of training questions, so you can test and improve your skills as we go along.\n\n\nWHAT IS BASHÂ SHELLÂ SCRIPTING?\nBash shell is the most common command line interpreter for Linux operating system. It is a result of decades of development of various command line interpreters,each building up on its predecessor good features, and adding its own improvements.\nIn todayâs world, scripting is gaining ground everywhere-from network devices to supercomputers. Once you master Bash for common administrative task, you can go ahead and learn Python or Perl more easily, because you have a solid foundation on what Linux can and can not do.\nAlthough Bash is not a full-blown programming languages, with itâs loops, conditions, variables, chaining multiple commands together, shell scripts have grown to be much more than just command line expressions put together.\n\n\nGUARANTEE\nIf within 30 days of buying the course you decide that it's not for you, please get a Udemy-backed refund.

      "description": "Welcome to linux bash shell scripting course. I'am Richard and I will be your instructor. I have great knowleadge about shell scripting as throughout my carrer I had been working for Fortune 50 company, where I apart from taking care of 200+ Solaris servers wrote many scripts for keeping live easy :)\nWhat is covered?\nBasics of scripting - no worry you don't know anything about scripting by now\nSha-bang explanation - what it is and why the heck it is called sha-bang\nDecision making\nRegular expressions\nWildcards\nFor & While loops\nFunctions\nReading arguments using CASE structure\nGetopt\nGetopts\n...and many more\nAnd what about AWK? Yes, it is covered here!Â  And what about SED? Also covered!\n\n\nWhy I have created this course?\nMany years back, when I was starting asÂ UNIX administrator, I had many ideas how to improve specific things using scripts. But, I couldn't find any good resource, which would take me through all needed topic in one place. Somewhere I got great explanation about sha-bang while regular expressions for shell scripting were only mentioned. Somewhere was good explanation about decision making in if statement, but SED and AWK part was missing, and that use of SED and AWK was in my carrer really important. Basically I cannot imagine any single production script, where I wouldn't used SED or AWK, because without them you are not able to create that \"magic\" in your script.\nMany years later, I am here to share in one place what is really needed in order to create magic script.Â Not only how to create script, do some decision making in if statements, write functions, use arrays, but mainly how to combine everything including AWK and SED. I was creating this course in a way, which would help me a lot to create great scripts during start of my career. All needed things in one place.\nPlease, watch my preview lectures to see what we are going to build in this course.",

I became the champion of the first worldwide FlowFest and I have a blog called SalesforceTime which is just about flows. Flow is the tool that I love most in Salesforce and I can say that in the last few years I didn't have a day that I didn't open the flow builder. I witnessed all of its improvement in these years and I can say that it improved a lot. I started using Salesforce Flow when it was not popular at all, but after all the improvements that Salesforce made, now it is one of the most popular tools of Salesforce.\nSalesforce Flow is a powerful business automation tool that gives the admins the powers of developers and it is the number one tool when it comes to complex business requirements. Salesforce announced that the other automation tools, which are workflow rules and process builder, will be retired soon. Therefore also for the simple requirements, now it is recommended to use flows. Flow is the future of the automation tools. So, if you are a Salesforce admin, implementer, or consultant, then it is essential to learn Salesforce Flow now.\nThere are endless things that you can perform using various types of flows.\nIn this course, you will learn;\n- How to build, debug, and launch flows in Salesforce Lightning\n- Available flow types, their differences, and selecting the correct flow type according to the needs\n- How to handle errors in flows\n- New tools like Flow Trigger Explorer and Migrate to Flow Tool\n- Working with collections\n- Multiple examples for all the flow types\n- Performing actions like sending emails\n- Best practices and tips\n\n\nThis course was prepared in Summer '22 release and updated with the new features of Spring '24 release (also the previous releases).",

Eventually Harald Milz wrote an odd sort of Linux-HA HOWTO. Unlike most HOWTOs, this was not about how to configure or use existing software, it was a collection of HA techniques which one could use if one were to write HA software for Linux.\nAlan Robertson was inspired by this description and thought that he could perhaps write some of the software for the project to act as a sort of initial seed crystal to help jump start the project. He got this initial software running on 18 March 1998. He created the first web site for the project on 19 October 1998, and the first version of the software was released on 15 November 1998.The first production customer of the software was Rudy Pawul of ISO-NE. The ISO-NE web site went into production in the second half of 1999.\nAt this point, the project was limited to two nodes and very simple takeover semantics, and no resource monitoring.\nThis was cured with version 2 of the software, which added n-node clusters, resource monitoring, dependencies, and policies. Version 2.0.0 came out on 29 July 2005.[5] This release represented another important milestone as it was the first version where very large contributions (in terms of code size) were made by the Linux-HA community at large. This series of releases brought the project to a level of feature parity-or-superiority with respect to commercial HA software.\nAfter version 2.1.4, the cluster resource manager component (responsible for starting and stopping resources and monitoring resource and node failure) was split off into a separate project called Pacemaker,[6] and the resource agents and other \"glue\" infrastructure were moved to separate packages. Thus with the version 3 series, the name Heartbeat should be used for the cluster messaging layer only",

      "description": "This course is based on the latest Ubuntu Server Long Term Support Release 22.04\nThis is a beginner's course that assumes you have no knowledge configuring a Linux server, server administration or NGINX.\nNew to Linux or server administration? Included in the course, is an absolute beginners \"crash\" Linux course. This 1 hour \"course within a course\" will teach you the commands, terminology and procedures as it relates to this course.\nThis course is NGINX is a high-performance web server that is responsible for serving almost all of the most popular sites in the world.\nWe start with a blank slate and layer by layer configure the perfect nginx server.Â  I will teach you, step by step, to a point where you will have the skill, knowledge and confidence to host multiple hardened WordPress sites, on an unmanaged VPS or dedicated server, using nginx.\nYou will need no support from your host. You will be your own system administrator.\nThis course covers the entire spectrum of configuring an Ubuntu based NGINX server. We will cover everything from initial server configuration to hardening and optimizing the server distribution.\nSome of the server optimization and hardening steps will include the following topics:\nSSH Key authentication\nSetting up both Uncomplicated Firewall and a \"Cloud Firewall\"\nBrute force attack protection\nSWAP\nHarden Shared Memory\nHarden and Optimize the Network Layer\nTuned and Congestion Control\nFile Access Times and setting the Open File Limits\nThen we install, harden and optimize Nginx, MariaDB and php8.1.Â  Although the default installations of Nginx, MariaDB and PHP8.1 are fairly well hardened, we will spend over 1.5 hours hardening and optimizing Nginx, MariaDB and PHP8.1\nThen we install our first WordPress site. We then start the process of hardening and optimizing WordPress. Installing a caching and security plugin does not optimize or harden a WordPress site. Some \"security plugins\" are a source of vulnerabilities themselves.\nAlmost 4 hours of the course is dedicated to hardening and optimizing WordPress. We look at hardening and optimizing WordPress from the server side and layer by layer we will harden our site.\nSome of the hardening topics include:\nInstalling SSL certificates and configuring automatic renewal of those certificates.\nSecuring the http response headers\nSetting the correct ownership and permissions on the WP files and directories\nUsing nginx directives to protect important parts of our site\nHot linking protection to stop other sites from stealing our bandwidth and driving up server costs\nNginx DDoS protection\nSetting up a web application firewall\nWhen it comes to optimizing WP, we will look at the process from both the server-side and the application (WordPress) side.\nOn the server-side we will cover the following:\noptimizing the operating system - prior to optimizing WordPress\noptimizing nginx - prior to optimizing WordPress\nconfiguring php-fpm according to your server resources - prior to optimizing WordPress - set to low your site slows down, set to high and your server will crash\nserver-side caching - fastcgi caching is brilliant\nreplacing WP cron with a real cron\nOn the application or WordPress side you need to look at the following:\nCaching plugin - W3 Total Cache\nOptimizing images\nPost revisions policy\nOptimizing the database\nCombining and minifying CSS and JS\nThroughout the course, the principle of install only what's needed, then harden and optimize is followed. The most important aspect of any server is security. I don't just glance over this aspect, every configuration step you will take is geared towards security.Â  We will optimize the server, but not at the expense of lax security.\nIt's impossible to list all the hardening and security layers we implement in this section, for a complete list please refer to the actual course curriculum.\nBy the end of this course, you will be ready to reap the benefits...\nYou'll be able to add a new revenue stream and start earning additional income hosting your own sites using NGINX. There will be numerous new services you will be adding to your resume as a web developer. You will be able to charge for numerous new services - site hosting, site optimization, Let's Encrypt SSL certificate installation and renewal, backups and even a monthly maintenance fee.\nThis course is not a lab experiment with no real-world application.\nThis course was not designed to be completed locally, on your pc or mac or using one of the many available \"Virtual Machines\". Oracle's VirtualBox is one example. The aim of the course is to instruct you on how to setup a secure/hardened hosting environment and then host multiple hardened WordPress sites on a commercially purchased VPS or dedicated server.\nI want you to able to look at server logs and see how malicious users and bots are scanning your server, probing and looking for vulnerabilities. You need to be able to see the result of your hardening - banning, blocking, rate limiting - in your server logs. This cannot be done in a Virtual Machine.\nAll that's left is for you to sign up for this course and start your wonderful journey as your very own systems administrator running multiple WordPress sites using the latest Ubuntu release and NGINX.",

But what is great is that for every lesson there is a short QUIZ that allows you to quickly check if you understand the topic. There are alsoÂ EXERCISES for you. You should be able to solve them on your own, but if you have problems â no worries, there are SOLUTIONS available as well!\n\nRegarding the technical requirements, all you need is just a computer with Windows and PowerShell in at leastÂ version 3 installed and administrator privileges.\nIf you donât knowÂ PowerShell at all or just only a little, this course is for you. Maybe you have already downloaded a script fromÂ Internet, maybe you have modified it â thatâs great! But if you had problems with understanding why the code is written is such and not another way, this tutorial should help you.\n\nWe start with basic information on how to start PowerShell console, how to execute commands, how to use help and step by step we come to more advanced topics.Â PowerShell is a programming language, so you need to know how to work with variables, how to build the if statement, howÂ  to execute a loop, format output,Â work with pipeline...\nSo if you work with windows, you need or want to learn powershell quickly â I recommend you this course.\n\nThank you and have fun!",

If\nYou can use the whole potential of it, if you know what you're doing.\nIâm using Mac computer everyday for more than 10 years and still learning new techniques and shortcuts how to optimise my workflow and I want to share it all with you. When I bought my first MacBook after using Windows for many many years, it took me many hours to learn even basic functionalities in macOS and months before I became entirely comfortable with my Mac.\nThis course will take you from a beginner / intermediate to an advanced macOS user in no time!\nYou're probably missing out a lot more than you think. I know that because I teach people how to use Mac every day and see how much time they waste in navigation menus, do things old fashioned ways and don't use quick shortcut keys or just incorrectly use the trackpad.\nBut I have good news! I have put together the most comprehensive and up to date course which includes more than 70 video tutorials and more than 6 hours of video instructions. I donât want to see people wasting so much time on such a powerful operating system.\nThis course can help you save great amount of time spent on your Mac. That will allow you to spend lot more time with your family or friends.\nEach tutorial clearly presents a topic and shows you how to use macOS. You can watch while trying out techniques for yourself. Presented by the appleonlineacademy website dedicated to helping people to understand and use Apple devices to their full potential.\nThis course will be regularly updated and I will be adding more macOS tips as I explore them in new released updates\n\n\nWhat makes this course different?\nIt has unique filming style which makes video tutorials fresh and not boring\nIt is straight to the point and clear to understand.\nIt includes bonus How to.. section with lot of tips and tricks\nI offer full personalised support in Q&A section and also in closed facebook group for enrolled students",

It is often used to collect information for security forensics, application performance management and compliance auditing. osquery supports multiple platforms including Windows, Linux and macOS.\nThe osquery toolset provides a SQL-based interface for querying operating system data. This allows complex queries to be constructed within a familiar environment that is both robust and secure. A query may consist of individual or aggregated components that are composed together with AND / OR operators to form a complete query. This provides the flexibility that is unique to SQL-based interfaces and allows users to define a flexible query workflow.\nIt is a project that aims to make operating systems more transparent. It does this by collecting information from the operating system and making it available to clients (the osquery client, shipped as part of osqueryd), which can then be queried using a SQL-like query language.\nA lot of command-line tools such as ps, lsof, netstat or ss are available on every Linux distribution and allow you to query the operating system. However, these tools often require particular privilege to run (typically root) and have a narrow scope. No privilege escalation is involved in using the OSQuery command line tool.\nIn this course you will learn how to use OSQuery to find information about your computers and servers. It is a beginners course and no prior knowledge is required, not even about SQL. If you are a sysadmin, developer, security researcher then this course is for you.",

Think \"/dev/random\"\nDuring the time I taught myself how to write kernel drivers a lot of the time I found articles from 2004 and they were outdated, this makes kernel development very difficult but I learnt a trick to make it all easier which I share in this course.\nThis course is designed to clear up all the misconceptions every detail of what we are doing is explained in depth and nothing is left out\nTaught by an expert that that has created kernel modules professionally in the work place.",

It covers basics about the x86 architecture and low-level programming. In this course, we will take you through the process of building a small working system step by step.\nThe first part of the course teaches all you need to know (processor modes, paging, exceptions and interrupts handling, etc.) before you can build the kernel on the x86 architecture. In this part, we will see how to prepare for mode switching. We switch from real mode to protected mode and then jump to long mode. Our kernel is running in 64-bit mode. After we switch to 64-bit mode, we will see how to handle exceptions and interrupts, how to switch between kernel mode and user mode.\nThe second part of the course teaches you how to build kernel modules such as processes, memory management, interrupt handling, etc. In this part, we will see how to write a keyboard driver and a console, how to interact with the OS kernel using the console. After finishing this part, you should know how to write user programs and make them run in your own operating system.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to build a simple operating system for the x86 architecture.\nUnderstand real mode\nUnderstand protected mode and long mode\nHow to handle interrupts and exceptions in the 64-bit mode\nHow to write OS kernel with the assembly code and C code\nBe able to write print function to print characters on the screen\nBe able to build a memory manager using x86 paging mechanism\nHow to write timer handler for the process manager\nHow to build a process manager to schedule processes and change them among different states (sleep, ready, killed)\nHow to implement system call module to make user programs running in the system\nWrite a keyboard driver (PS/2)\nWrite a simple console and interact with OS kernel using commands\nBe able to write a simple file system module which supports reading fat16 system.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, you should be able to develop your own 64-bit operating system.",

It is one of four commercial operating systems that have versions certified to The Open Group's UNIX 03 standard (the others being macOS, HP-UX and eulerOS),[6] and one of 12 certified to the UNIX 95 standard.\n\n\nThe AIX family of operating systems debuted in 1986, became the standard operating system for the RS/6000 series on its launch in 1990, and is still actively developed by IBM. It is currently supported on IBM Power Systems alongside IBM i and Linux.\n\n\nAIX was the first operating system to have a journaling file system, and IBM has continuously enhanced the software with features such as processor, disk and network virtualization, dynamic hardware resource allocation (including fractional processor units), and reliability engineering",

      "description": "VMware vSphere 6.0 is the platform businesses depend on to deploy, manage and run their virtualized Windows and Linux workloads.\nIn this course you will learn how to connect to and use shared SAN Storage including Fibre and iSCSI storage, to Format and Expand VMFS volumes, how to Resource Tune Virtual Machines, how to create and tune Resource Pools, and how to perform cold, VMotion and Storage VMotion migrations.\nLearn Storage, VMFS, Resource Management and VM Migrations\n\nThis course covers four major topics that all vSphere 6 vCenter administrators must know:\n\nFirst, we look at shared Fibre and iSCSI shared storage. We start with an overview of features and capabilities of suitable SANs. We move on to discuss storage network design for redundancy and performance, SAN security with Zoning and Authentication, iSCSI hardware and Software initiators, how to scan and review SAN LUNs and various Storage views. We complete the section with a presentation of NFS v4.1 file shares (new to vSphere 6.).\nNext we look at VMware's cluster file system - VMFS. We learn how to create VMFS partitions and their properties. We look at basic capacity management (and what can go wrong) and offer two strategies for managing VMFS capacity. We go on to talk about Path Selection Policies (PSPs) and explain the trade offs of VMware's three provided PSPs. We show you how to select the optimal PSP based on your storage network design and your SAN's capabilities.\nWe move on to discuss Resource Management and Resource Pools. Effectively managing CPU and Memory is critical to host and VM scalability. VMware provides three tunables - Reservations, Shares and Limits, to help you delegate resources as you require. We show you how to assess resource needs and how to create/use Resource Pools. Finally, we explain Expandable Reservations and show you how to use them safely.\nFinally, we look at VM migrations. VMware supports cold (powered off) migrations to a new ESXi host or datastore. Next we look at VMotion hot VM migration - where we hot move a running VM to a second ESXi host. We look at CPU compatibility requirements and show you how to tell if your physical host CPUs are VMotion compatible. Finally, you will learn how to perform Storage VMotion (hot move a VM from one datastore to another) and the Use Cases for Storage VMotion.\nThe skills you will acquire in this course will help make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.\nAdded Bonus! This course is 100% downloadable. Take it with you and learn on your schedule.",

      "description": "In computer security, Hardening is usually the process of Securing a system by Reducing its surface of vulnerability, which is larger when a system performs more functions; in principle, a single-function system is more secure than a multipurpose one. Reducing available ways of attack typically includes changing default passwords, removal of unnecessary software, unnecessary usernames or logins, and disabling or removal of unnecessary services.\n\n\nWhat is Hardening means:\nHardening, when applied to computing, is the practice of reducing a systemâs vulnerability by reducing its attack surface.\n\n\nHardening may involve a reduction in attack vectors by culling the pathways, or vectors, attackers would use. It may range from adhering to blanket policies such as Zero Trust, the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), or Defense In Depth, but also manifest as certain task lists such as implementing workforce training, segmenting resources, automating security updates, resetting default passwords, hashing passwords, and ceasing to store or transmit data unless it is encrypted.\n\n\nReducing attack vectors through hardening also involves system owners cutting unnecessary services or processes. Overall, a system that provides more services has a much broader attack surface than one performing just one function.\n\n\nIn this course, You will learn how to hardening yourÂ  Unix and Linux systems.",

      "description": "This course consist of two major parts.\n\nFirst is a 10 Day section to learn how theÂ docker engineÂ works from beginners to advanced.\nTheÂ Â basics of the docker engineÂ would be covered and explained in detail. Post that we would look at Docker Swarm for orchestration of containers;Â Docker Compose &Â Docker Stack for the container flow &Â forÂ for spinning up entireÂ production environments withÂ one command.\nWe would also look at how to create and run Auto Healing &Â Auto Scaling environments, we would use some community tools to visualise orchestration and Self Healing on the go. These are community created tools that add exceptional value & bring clarityÂ to the docker learning curve.\nWe would also look at Docker forÂ AWSÂ &Â Azure and how Json scripts are used by these cloud providers.Â Everything would be done withÂ hands-on Labs.\nIn the second part I'll explain Industry Use Cases where docker is being used in production and do labs for these also.\nI would take you through implementation such as\n1. Splunk for docker logs (alsoÂ used in most enterprises).\n2. Connecting MySQL Workbench to a SQLÂ DB running in a docker containers.\n3. Using Tracers to visualise the latent between Micro-Services.\n\n\nWith the course you can expect the below from me.\n\n1. You can reach out to me and I'll respond to your queries asap.\n2. I'll keep updating the courses regularly as new features are rolled out by Docker.\n\n\nHigh % ofÂ Â 5 *Â REVIEWSÂ Till Date\n\n************************************************************************\n\n\nLeandro Alcantara da Rosa\n\nConteÃºdo bem prÃ¡tico e didÃ¡tico. Explica com situaÃ§Ãµes diÃ¡rias.\n\n\nRafi Dudekula\nFantastic resource for beginners to learn Docker. Extensive use of play with docker website to demonstrate concepts and allow us to experiment with all that we learned. Highly recommended!\n\n\n\nProduct Owner Muqadus\n\nTrust me, even an IT novice will understand how Docker works after taking this amazingly well laid-out 10 day Docker course. Big Data, Cloud Computing and Containers are the next big thing in IT and we have Containers covered in this course. Brownie points to the instructor for making it so simple and easy to understand.\n\n\nSoftware Engineer Siddhartha Totha\nIÂ really liked the way the tutor explained the things. I feel I've learned good amount of information with this course and I think it's the best place to get started for docker\n\n\n\nKhairul Nizam BÂ S\nI would recommend this course for Beginners and Intermediates; but you must have some Linux and coding experience. The explanation is direct and simple. I've had some Docker experience in a live production environment but my knowledge of it is only minimal. Taking this course has further improved my understanding of Docker. It's also a great refresher course for those with substantial understanding of Docker. There are some typo mistakes in the course but you will get used to it and amend those mistakes when you're doing the hands-on practices. Instructor is also obliging enough to update this course (i.e. additional videos/lessons) to fulfil some of the students' requests in the FAQ. Thumbs up! :)\n\n\nKavin\nIt's an awesome tutorial to learn docker from basics\n\n\nAqua\nExceptionally well made course, I completed more than 50 %, the first time I started doing this. Very nice teaching style & the instructor explains the concepts very well and extremely useful community tools were introduced. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand the workings of the Docker engine.\n\n\nDavid Setliff\n\nHe's explanations make perfect sense and he's goes at a good speed for experienced sys admins\n\n\n\nSoftware Engineer Siddhartha Thota\nI really liked the way the tutor explained the things. I feel I've learned good amount of information with this course and I think it's the best place to get started for docker\n\n\n\nJosef Ababat\n\nThis course is what Im looking for. Nicely explained with an Indian-English accent. The pace is perfect. So far i learned a lot. I like when the instructor reviews the commands from the previous video as a refresher. Good job! So far...\n\n\n\nSatish\nReally Helpful for beginners to learn what docker exactly does\n\n\n\nBhat\nWas looking for some material on dockers that is easy to grasp. Did not find anything better than this on Docker and Containers. To the point, Easy to understand and well explained. Thank you.\nNitest Srivastava\n\nExcellent Course!!! Very explicitly and diligently explained. Must watch for starters like me. Wonderful job and kudos to the instructor.\n\n\n\nSandeep Ajjampur\nExcellent !! Specially for beginning with\n\n\n\n************************************************************************\n\n\nWe would also use graphical tools to understand how orchestration works for containers and how the system self heals. We would create nginx webÂ servers, wordpress websites, three tier architecture based websites etc &Â also learnÂ how Docker for Azure & AWS works.\nThis course deals entirely with the docker engine and the commands that are used for getting things done using docker. Throughout the course we focus on enhancing the knowledge of the prospective student on docker.",

What will you gain? A much better productivity, less time spent with the mouse and a better user experience overall.\nThis is a beginners course that teaches you all the commands you need to know when working with Linux. The shell is a program that takes commands from the user, processes them, and sends them to the operating system kernel. Shell command can be used at the terminal or in scripts.\nThe command line isn't a relic: even in the twenty-first century, it's a powerful tool for anyone who uses their computer for more than just checking email.Â  With the command line you can browse the file system, interact with other computers, and much much more. Any server you will use, will have a command line interface (SSH).Â  On top of that, Linux is often used for development and ethical hacking. It is a must-have skill for any Software Developer, Cyber Security exert, Ethical Hacker, Sysadmin etc.\nIf you never used Linux before and want to learn the command line, this course is for you.

      "description": "I was asked this question in Amazon/Google Interviews :\n1. How would you design a garbage collector for C programs?\n2. If designing a garbage collector was that easy, why we donât have it integrate with C programming language already ??\nComplete this course to get the answers.Â  :p\n\n\nThis course is a Project-based course and involved coding in C at every stage of the course.\nMention this project on your Resume with all proud.\n\n\nThis is a C Project (open for extension for C++) in which you will learn and write a library that catches the memory leaks, if any, by the application. In this project, I have explained step by step how to design and implement a garbage collector library called MLD (Memory Leak Detector) which when integrated to your application will provide the facility to catch leaked objects and report them. MLD library will be the generic library and has the ability to parse any application's data structures and manipulate them.\nThe Project is explained in 3 phases.\n\n\nNote: This is a course that require a little bit of analysis power, beginner students can also learn much from this course that how you can create a program which can parse its own objects and structures. This technique is used to create many other projects out of which one is Memory leak detection.\nAdvice:Â Class of Students who needs \"spoon-feeding\", pls refrain from enrolling in project-based courses.\n\n\nKey highlights :\nSince the advent of C/C++ Programming language, Memory management is one of the responsibilities which the developer has to deal with\nC/C++ Softwares often suffers from Two Memory related Problems :\nMemory corruption\nMemory leak\nUnlike Java, C/C++ does not have the luxury for automatic garbage collection\nJava does not allow programmer to access the physical memory directly, but C/C++ does, not does java expose pointers directly to the developer/coder. Therefore Java applications do not suffer from Memory corruption either, but C/C++ does\nIn this course, we will design and implement Memory Leak Detector (MLD) tool for C programs, easily extensible to C++ as well\n\n\nSome Students have requested to provide a formal description of this project. For Students who want to mention this project in their resume, or doing this project as their OS project - you can mention the following title and abstract of this project as below :\n\n\nTitle:Â  \"Design and Implementation of Java-like Garbage Collector for C Programs\".\nIn this project, we try to implement a garbage collector for C programs which work on the principle of reachability of objects to detect memory leaks. Through this project, we understand the limitation of such a garbage collector for C like programming languages (which have direct access to underlying memory addresses, unlike Java/python) and analyze its limitations and cost for being an inbuilt feature of C-like language.",

For example, when a user's authentication fails, the system may generate Event ID 672.\nWindows NT 4.0 added support for defining \"event sources\" (i.e. the application which created the event) and performing backups of logs.\nWindows 2000 added the capability for applications to create their own log sources in addition to the three system-defined \"System\", \"Application\", and \"Security\" log files. Windows 2000 also replaced NT4's Event Viewer with a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in.\n\n\nWindows Task Scheduler\nTask Scheduler is a job scheduler in Microsoft Windows that launches computer programs or scripts at pre-defined times or after specified time intervals. Microsoft introduced this component in Microsoft.\nThe Task Scheduler service works by managing Tasks; Task refers to the action (or actions) taken in response to a trigger(s). A task is defined by associating a set of actions, which can include launching an application or taking some custom-defined action, to a set of triggers, which can either be time-based or event-based.\n\n\nWindows Task Manager\nask Manager, previously known as Windows Task Manager, is a task manager, system monitor, and startup manager included with Microsoft Windows",

      "description": "If you are a current or aspiring IT professional in search of sound, practical techniques to analyze and model data as part of the overall data management lifecycle, this is the course for you.\nDuring the course, youâll put what you learn to work and define sample data model segments in both âclassicâ entity-relationship notation and also the âcrowâs footâ notation to help emphasize the best practices and techniques covered in this course. Each section has either scenario based quiz questions or hands on assignments that emphasizes key learning objectives for that sectionâs material. This way, you can be confident as you move through the course that youâre picking up the key points about data modeling.\nTo build this course, I drew from more than 30 years of my own work involving data modeling and related disciplines. Long ago, in the late 1980s, I was a software engineer at what was then the worldâs second largest computer systems vendor, Digital Equipment Corporation. I wrote software for a âconceptual and logical database design toolâ - in other words, a data modeling tool. My own consulting firm, Thinking Helmet, Inc., specializes in data management and analytics-focused disciplines for which data modeling is essential. Iâve rolled up my sleeves and personally tackled every aspect of what youâll learn in this course. Iâve even learned a few painful lessons, and have built a healthy share of âlessons learnedâ into the course material.\nIn this course, I take you from the fundamentals and concepts of data modeling all the way through a number of best practices and techniques that youâll need to build data models in your organization. Youâll find many examples that clearly demonstrate the key concepts and techniques covered throughout the course. By the end of the course, youâll be all set to not only put these principles to work, but also to make the key data modeling and design decisions required by the âartâ of data modeling that transcend the nuts-and-bolts techniques and design patterns.\nSpecifically, this course will cover:\nFoundational data modeling concepts and fundamentals\nThe symbiotic relationship between data modeling and database design (Hint: the two are not exactly the same!)\nDifferent modeling approaches, techniques, and notations that you can put to work\nThe fundamentals of entities, attributes, and relationships, as well as how to express these concepts in multiple modeling notations\nHow we incorporate real-world complexities into our entities, attributes, and relationships\nThe data modeling lifecycle that includes forward engineering a conceptual data model to a logical and then a physical model, as well as how we reverse-engineer a physical data model back to the conceptual level\nDifferent software-based approaches for data modeling tools\nData modeling is both an art and a science. While we have developed a large body of best practices over the years, we still have to make this-or-that types of decisions throughout our data modeling work, often based on deep experience rather than specific rules. Thatâs what Iâve instilled into this course: the fusion of data modeling art and science that you can bring to your organization and your own work. So come join me on this journey through the world of data modeling!",

You will first grasp the fundamental concepts of both physical and virtual address spaces for a processor and learn how to inspect them in a Linux environment. A key focus will be on the division of the virtual address space into distinct kernel and user spaces.\nYou'll gain an understanding of how the operating system handles memory in units called pages, and what triggers a page fault. The course will then detail the crucial process of converting a virtual address to a physical address, including the proper format specifiers for printing addresses.\nFurthermore, you will explore the concepts of Low Memory and High Memory and the kernel's efficient Buddy Allocator for managing memory. You'll learn how to use the /proc/buddyinfo file to monitor memory zones. The course also covers dynamic memory allocation in the kernel using essential APIs like kmalloc and vmalloc, clarifying the differences between them and the various flags they use, such as GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC. The course also addresses what happens when you attempt to allocate zero-sized memory. Lastly, you will examine the structure of the kernel stack and use the qemu-system-x86 command for practical exercises.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Linux Basics and Shell Programming course by Uplatz.\n\n\nIn Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems, the shell is an interactive interface that allows users to run additional commands and tools. When you log in to the operating system, you'll see the normal shell, which lets you do things like copy files and restart the machine. Because they also operate as a programming language with a full set of tools, Linux shells are far more powerful than the Windows command line. Multiple shells can be installed on a machine, and they can be switched between rapidly.\nThe term shell refers to the interface between a user and an operating system service in UNIX. Shell offers a user interface and takes human-readable instructions into the system. It then executes those commands that can run automatically and outputs the program as a shell script. A shell in the Linux operating system accepts instructions from the user, processes them, and then returns an output. It is the user interface that allows a user to interact with programs, instructions, and scripts. A shell can be accessed through a terminal, which also executes it. Shell scripts are widely used for a variety of system administration activities, including disc backups, system log analysis, and so on. They're also frequently utilized as sophisticated application installation scripts. They're ideal for all of them since they allow for complexity without necessitating it.\n\n\nThis Linux Basics with Shell Scripting training by Uplatz will teach you everything from the fundamentals of the Linux/Unix shell scripting software to advanced Shell Scripting ideas.

It covers basics about the AArch64 architecture and low-level programming. In this course, we will take you through the process of building a small working system step by step.\nThe first part of the course teaches all you need to know (processor modes, paging, exceptions and interrupts handling, etc.) before you can build the kernel on the AArch64 architecture. In this part, we will see how to prepare for mode switching. We switch from EL2 to EL1 and then jump to EL0. Our kernel is running in 64-bit mode. We will see how to handle exceptions and interrupts, how to switch between kernel mode and user mode.\nThe second part of the course teaches you how to build kernel modules such as processes, memory management, interrupt handling, etc. In this part, we will see how to interact with the OS kernel using the console. After finishing this part, you should know how to write user programs and make them running in your own operating system.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to build a simple operating system for the AArch64 architecture.\nHow to handle interrupts and exceptions\nHow to write OS kernel with the assembly code and C code\nBe able to write print function to print characters on the screen\nBe able to build a memory manager using paging mechanism\nHow to write timer handler for the process manager\nHow to build a process manager to schedule processes and change them among different states (sleep, ready, killed)\nHow to implement system call module to make user programs running in the system\nWrite a UART driver\nWrite a simple console and interact with OS kernel using commands\nBe able to write a simple file system module which supports reading fat16 system.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, you should be able to develop your own 64-bit operating system.",

      "description": "Hello to everyone!\n\nWelcome to Linux for Beginners is for everyone. Start your Linux Ubuntu journey with Linux basics / Linux fundamentals & learn more course.\nLinux for Beginners is for everyone. Start your Linux Ubuntu journey with Linux basics / Linux fundamentals & learn more\n\nLinux is available in a range of different distributions that are tailored to the needs and skills of its users. Simple distributions, like openSUSE, are great for personal computing, while Linux Ubuntu is ideal for network admins and computer scientists.\nLinux has a somewhat inaccurate reputation as being a much more technical and complex alternative to mainstay operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In reality, Linux is an approachable, open-source, and customizable OS thatâs designed to address huge deficiencies in commercial operating systems.\nOur student says that: I loved this course and it taught me so many things, that now I am very competent in a terminal that has a UNIX background. Almost all of what is taught was transferable to the Mac terminal, and thanks to this course, I can even make my own scripting programs to make my life easier.\n\nWhat is Linux and why should I use it?\nLinux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. The operating system that competes for the most with Linux is Windows. Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nBoth ethical (white hat) hackers and malicious (black hat) hackers often prefer to use the Linux operating system (OS) over Windows OS. The biggest reason hackers turn to Linux is because it is far more accessible to a wider range of people than Windows OS offers. Linux is free, open-source, and provides a well-integrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS. This means anyone can modify Linux to create their own programs and software. Malicious hackers often opt for Linux because it gives them more control when using Linux, and ethical hackers need to be well-versed in Linux because itâs so popular among black hat hackers. Ethical hackers also often prefer using Linux as it has better existing security measures than Windows and doesnât usually require third-party antivirus software.\nHow long will it take to learn Linux and how can I teach it to myself?\nThe time it takes to learn Linux can vary, depending on whether you have existing background knowledge of other operating systems and how deep of an understanding you want to gain. For beginners learning Linux to pursue a career in IT or software administration, you may only need a basic understanding of how to navigate and execute functions using Linux and how applications built on Linux behave. If you plan to become an ethical hacker, or pentester, you may need a more in-depth knowledge of Linux security procedures and a skill in manipulating Linux programs. You can learn Linux on your own time by seeking out video tutorials and online courses. There are plenty of courses available on Udemy that teach the fundamentals of Linux and more advanced Linux skills.\nWhat careers use Linux?\nMany jobs in IT, software development, and cybersecurity rely on Linux skills and expertise. A career in app development generally requires a deep understanding of Linux, as many app developers use Linux as a basis for their applications. Software-focused career paths that frequently use Linux include developer and software engineering roles for Python, Java, and Linux systems. Nearly any role in cybersecurity, such as a penetration tester or ethical hacker, requires a strong knowledge of Linux. With Linux expertise and skills, you could work as a system administrator, IT professional, system architect, or database administrator. You may even work in website development, maintenance, or security, as people in those roles build a majority of their web applications on Linux.\nWhat is the core of the Linux operating system?\nThe core component of any operating system is called the kernel. Linuxâs core is simply referred to as the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a single program that manages crucial tasks such as allocating memory, communicating software functions to the computerâs CPU, and comprehending all of the input and output from the computerâs hardware. The kernel is the most important part of an OS and often runs in a separate area from the rest of a computerâs software. The kernel is just one part of a full operating system, which includes a combination of components such as the bootloader, init system, graphical server, desktop environment, and more. The name âLinuxâ can refer to both the kernel itself (the Linux kernel) and an operating system built around that kernel. For example, the Android OS and the Ubuntu distribution are both made using the Linux kernel.\nWhat are the best Linux distributions for beginners?\nThere is a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from when learning and working with Linux. When you are first learning Linux, the distribution you choose to learn may depend on how you plan to apply your Linux skills. If you are pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you may select a different Linux distribution to start with than someone pursuing a career in game development, for instance. Online courses are some of the best resources for beginners to Linux, as they will give guidance on which Linux distribution is a good fit for the intended application of Linux. For beginners, a few of the most highly recommended Linux distributions include Elementary OS, Ubuntu Linux, and Ubuntu Budgie. Other distributions that are considered easy to learn and master are Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Nitrux, Kodachi, Rescatux, and Parrot Security.\nThe first computer operating systems worked based on Linux.

      "description": "About This Course\nAre you the kind of person who learns best by doing? Do courses with just Power Point voice-overs leave you cold?Â If so, then this course is for you, because the only Power Points you'll see are in the introduction and end of class lectures.\nIn this course, I cover vSphere 6.7 from a build it, configure it, administer it, run it , scale it perspective. 100% of this course is Hands-on Lab demos of an actual VMware vSphere 6.7 installation. In this course, I'll take you from first-principles (powering on a new server) to a completed, working Compute Load Balancing / Storage Load Balancing / Failure Recovery cluster and everything in between.\nI've organized this course into Sections - that focus on major aspects of vSphere 6.7. In each Section, lectures are composed of one or more Hands-on Lab demo videos... with voice overs to explain what I am doing and why I am doing it. IÂ also include narrative covering best practices, things to watch out for, issues / concerns, etc. and much more.\nThere are 6 free-preview lectures (first lecture of Sections 1-6) offering over 70 minutes of free content. I encourage you to watch these lectures to see if this course is for you.\nPlease note that this course does not provide access to live labs but does include video demonstrations of how to complete tasks using vSphere 6.7.\n\n\nHow to Use This Course\nIf you are new to vSphere or are wondering how all of the vSphere pieces fit together, start at the beginning and see how it's done. If you have vSphere experience, jump to the Section that covers exactly what you need to know.\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you can use it for many purposes:\nLearn how to install, configure and administer a complete, working vSphere 6.7 system\nUse individual lessons to learn how to do specific tasks (perhaps before you do them at work)\nCompare what I've done in my environment to your environment to see if there are vSphere features that you could be using (but aren't)\nIs your environment well designed and implemented? Is it configured consistently, is it scalable and is it redundant?Â All three are critically important and IÂ explain as I go what you can do to achieve these objectives\n\nWhat Does This Course Cover?\nBasics: ESXi, vCenter installation, configuration\nNetworking:Â Introductory and advanced vSwitch networking including security, jumbo frames, pNIC teaming and dvSwitches\nVirtual Machines:Â Build, configure, hot clone, rapid deployment, hot-plug vHardware and more\nStorage:Â NFS, iSCSI, VMFS, Raw Device Maps, Profile Driven Storage, Load balanced Storage DRS clusters\nAdministration: ESXi and vCenter permissions and Infrastructure monitoring with Alarms\nResource Management:Â Resource Pools, VMotion and Storage VMotion, DRS load balanced clusters\nMaximizing VM availability:Â vSphere HA clusters, Continuously available Fault Tolerant protected VMs\n\n\nHow Will This Course Benefit You?\nIf you are new to vSphere 6.7\nSee tasks in the order they are normally done\nSee how to do each task, step-by-step\nExplanations as you go help build knowledge\nIf you are experienced with legacy versions of vSphere\nSee how to complete common tasks in vSphere 6.7 using Web interfaces\nLearn about new vSphere 6.7 features and capabilities\nAre you an experienced vSphere 6.7 administrator\nUse this course as a vSphere 6.7 how-to-do-it reference guide\nGo directly to advanced topics that you need to learn now\nReview / refresh yourself before you perform tasks in production\n\nYour Ultimate vSphere 6.7 Reference Guide\nJust go to the section where I cover the material you need to learn, watch how it is done and pay attention to the best practices, tips or pitfalls I explain while I'm doing the task.\n\nMy goal in developing this course is to for you to view it as an indispensable how-to-get-it-done reference guide. So sign up and let me know if I've succeeded!",

This course is designed for beginners, intermediate learners, and aspiring developers who want to build a solid foundation in Java and gradually advance to more complex concepts.\nWeâll begin with the Introduction to Java and walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up Java and writing your first Java program. From there, youâll learn the fundamentals of Java, including classes, objects, and operators, giving you the confidence to write clean and efficient code.\nAs we move forward, youâll master loops (while and for), arrays, and switch statementsâthe core building blocks of any Java application. Youâll then dive deeper into object-oriented programming concepts like constructors, methods, inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes, ensuring you understand how to create scalable and reusable code.\nIn the advanced modules, weâll cover threads in Java for handling multitasking, along with exception handling to write robust, error-free applications. By combining theory with practical coding exercises, youâll gain hands-on experience that prepares you for both academic exams and industry-level projects.\nBy the end of this course, youâll be confident in:\nWriting and running Java programs from scratch.\nApplying object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.\nUsing loops, arrays, and methods effectively in problem-solving.\nImplementing interfaces, abstract classes, and multithreading.\nHandling exceptions and writing production-ready Java code.\nWhether youâre aiming to become a software developer, mobile app creator, or preparing for technical interviews, this course provides everything you need to succeed.\nEnroll today and start your journey from beginner to advanced Java developer with hands-on coding practice and real-world examples!",

A virtual switch ensures the same functions as a regular switch, with the exception of some advanced functionalities. Namely, unlike physical switches, a virtual switch:\nDoes not learn the MAC addresses of transit traffic from the external network.\nDoes not participate in Spanning Tree protocols.\nCannot create a network loop for redundant network connection.\nVMwareâs virtual switches are called vSwitches. vSwitches are used for ensuring connections between virtual machines as well as connecting virtual and physical networks. A vSwitch uses a physical network adapter (also called NIC - Network Interface Controller) of the ESXi host for connection to the physical network. You might want to create a separate network with a vSwitch and physical NIC for performance and/or security reasons in the following cases:\nConnecting storage, such as NAS or SAN, to ESXi hosts.\nvMotion network for live migration of virtual machines between ESXi hosts.\nFault Tolerance logging network.\n\n\nVirtual machines connect to a network much in the same way physical ones do. The difference is that the VMs use virtual network adapters and virtual switches to establish connections with physical networks. If you have used VMs running on VMware Workstation, you may be familiar with three default virtual networks. Each of them uses a different virtual switch:\nVMnet0 Bridged network â allows connection of a VMâs virtual network adapter to the same network as the physical hostâs network adapter.\nVMnet1 Host Only network â allows connection to a host only, by using a different subnet.\nVMnet8 NAT network â uses a separate subnet behind the NAT, and allows connection of the VMâs virtual adapter through the NAT to the same network as the physical hostâs adapter.\nKeywords:\nVMware vSphere 7\nVMware vSphere training\nInstall VMware vSphere Hypervisor",

Marstiller (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material.Â  Â -- Raymond B.Â  (Udemy Student)\n\n\nMain thing about course is its simplicity and the hierarchy. Design is very good and easy which helps to understand things better.Â  -- Akash Garg (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am gettingÂ  -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.Â  -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.Â  -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.Â  -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.Â  -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs termsÂ  -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course.Â  -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",

Instructions are cryptic, commands are hard to find and it's rarely obvious what they do. The reality is that using the Os X Command Line effectively will make you a much better programmer and Mac power user. Not only will learning the command line let you complete many tasks more quickly and easily, but you'll be able to do things you simply couldn't otherwise.\nIn this course you'll learn the essential tools for feeling comfortable and getting stuff done:\nNavigating around your hard drive\nReading and writing files\nMoving, copying and deleting files and directories\nTerminal window customization\nKeyboard shortcuts\nSearching\nProductivity Tips & Tricks\nIf you're a Mac power user or an aspiring developer you owe it to yourself to learn the command line. A programmer who doesn't know the command line is like a writer who can't use a pen. Knowing the command line is essential for really applying almost any programming language today. Sign up for the course and give it a shot. A full refund awaits you if you don't feel more confident and powerful inside of that Terminal window.\nI look forward to seeing you inside.",

      "description": "Many of you have already heard of Linux while watching some movies about ethical hacking, artificial intelligence or scientific research. Others may know a colleague or someone who performs several office tasks quickly, without telling you his/her secret. Well! the secret is certainly Linux.\nThis operating system is actually everywhere, from smartphones to smart cars, from home desktops to companies supercomputers. So if you don't know exactly how this wonderful operating system works, or how to use it like a pro, then this course is made specially for you.\nMost of the courses available online use traditional teaching methods which make learning a bit boring even when the subject is so interesting. This is why I am offering you, as a young lecturer at the university, this course with the following three advantages:\n- A futuristic and high quality design.\n- A new innovative and fun teaching method.\n- A minimum of theory and a maximum of practice : through 5 well chosen projects to test your knowledge.\nSo whatever your job, if you have a computer, you will learn through this course how to make your professional and personal tasks much easier using Linux operating system and its commands.\nThis course is divided into two parts, the first is an overview of the Linux system and the second concerns practical projects. The objective of the first part is to find out:\n- What is Linux?\n- Why everyone wants to learn this operating system? What are this advantage over other systems like Windows?\n- What are the different distributions of this system? and what are the differences between them?\n- How this OS was designed. And why is this design wonderful?\n- How to install Linux Mint which is a very common version.\nIn the second part we will work on five practical projects. And in each of these projects we will discover a set of Linux commands.\n- The first is the design of a system analyzer, which allows any user to easily obtain a summary of the various hardware and software components of any machine such as: processor performance, Ram, hard drive, system version etc.\n- The second is the development of an automatic application installer. It allows you to install or remove up to 70 applications with a single command.\n- The third is a Linux script allowing to classify a large number of files in a folder according to their type (image, documents, etc.) and their creation date. This script will also remove duplicate files to optimize the disk.\n- The fourth project aims to create a Linux command that allows you to configure remote access to multiple computers without authentication.\n- The last is a script that allows you to manage the different versions of a text or code file and automatically insert a personalized header.\nSo welcome everyone to this course which will certainly teach you a lot of skills.",

What I came up with this course is a cool, easy and professional way to make your Windows installation experience as never been before.\nThis course is a mix of many features, tools, and ideas that are combined together to master custom Windows image that works on all desktops & notebooks you have.\nWe will create a virtual Windows machine (Windows 7, 8.1, or 10) using either Hyper-V or VirtualBox, whatever is convenient for you. Then, we will modify the image, add files to it, install applications, updates, and whatever modifications we want. Respectively we will capture that Windows machine using ImageXÂ to extract a WIM file with all these modifications.\nNext, we will see how we can use this extracted WIM file to create a bootable Windows image, moving to use an XML file that we can create to automate installing Windows almost without any user interaction.\nFeel like this is too advanced technical course? Don't do! We will explain every single step. No rocket science in this course, guaranteed! You will see how to do each step in a very easy and straight forward way.\nWhy you are still reading here?

Each virtual machine acts like a complete computer, running an operating system and programs. When you need computing resources, virtual machines give you more flexibility, help save time and money, and are a more efficient way to use hardware than just running one operating system on physical hardware.\nHyper-V runs each virtual machine in its own isolated space, which means you can run more than one virtual machine on the same hardware at the same time. You might want to do this to avoid problems such as a crash affecting the other workloads, or to give different people, groups or services access to different systems.\nThis course will cover the following areas, and many more:\nUnderstand Server and Desktop virtualization\nCreate virtual machines\nInstalling an operating system on a virtual machine\nCreate virtual switches\nUse PowerShell to manage virtual machines, virtual switchesÂ  and Hyper-V settings\nSecure virtual machines\nUnderstand virtual hard drive types\nManage advanced network settings\nManage checkpoints\nConfigure replication of virtual machines\nMigrate virtual machines\nExport and Import of virtual machines\nManaging NUMA\nConfigure virtual nesting\nEnable virtual machine shielding\nConfigure SmartPaging\nConfigure integration services",

After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in 2010, it was renamed Oracle Solaris\nSolaris superseded the company's earlier SunOS in 1993, and became known for its scalability, especially on SPARC systems, and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider. Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors. Solaris was registered as compliant with UNIX 03 until 29 April 2019.\nHistorically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. With OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January 2010, Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions.\nIn 2011, the Solaris 11 kernel source code leaked to BitTorrent. Through the Oracle Technology Network (OTN), industry partners can gain access to the in-development Solaris source code.[11] Solaris is developed under a proprietary development model, and only the source for open-source components of Solaris 11 is available for download from Oracle",

      "description": "This course is aimed to IT Pros and is supposed to give the viewer the information they need to know to get started with Active Directory (AD DS) and its key concepts. The goal is to provide coverage of ADÂ DSÂ main concepts like AD DS components: schema, forest, domain, OU (Organizational Unit), containers. There is also an introduction to Active Directory Administrative Center and the other management tools.\nActive Directory Domain Services (AD DS) can help you manage your network more effectively. For instance, you can use it to manage user and computer accounts in groups instead of managing one account at a time. It also provides ways to group objects together in containers called organizational units (OUs) and to delegate administrative tasks to help you distribute workload efficiently.\nManaging device identities is becoming increasingly complex as more employees bring their own devices into the workplace. As Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) programs expand, you will be managing device identities for many types of personal devices and the various operating systems that they run. AD DS has many features that can make this easier.\nThis module describes how to use both graphical tools and Windows PowerShell to manage user and computer accounts and groups. It covers how to manage an enterprise network by performing bulk operations to modify object attributes.\nThe course is targeted to help learning Active Directory and do your job more efficiently.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\nDescribe the components of AD DS.\nDescribe AD DS domains.\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Describe OUs and their purpose.\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Describe AD DS forests and trees and explain how you can deploy them in a network.\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Explain how an AD DS schema provides a set of rules that manage the objects and attributes that the AD DS domain database stores.\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Describe Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Identify the tools available for administering AD DS.\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Describe what is new for on-premises Active Directory Domain Services in Windows Server 2016.\nÂ· Describe the purpose of domain controllers.\nÂ· Understand what the SYSVOL folder contains.\nÂ· Describe the purpose of the global catalog.\nÂ· Describe the AD DS signâin process and the importance of DNS and service records (SRV records) in that process.\nÂ· Explain the functions of operations masters.\nÂ· Describe operations master role transfer and seizing.\nÂ· Explain how to install a domain controller by using the GUI.\nÂ· Explain how to install a domain controller on a Server Core installation of Windows Server 2016.\nÂ· Explain how to upgrade a domain controller by installing from media.\nÂ· Explain how to install a domain controller by installing from media.\nÂ· Describe the process of cloning domain controllers.\nÂ· Explain best practices for virtualizing domain controllers.\nÂ· Manage user accounts in AD DS.\nÂ· Manage groups in AD DS.\nÂ· Manage computer objects in AD DS.\nÂ· Use Windows PowerShell for AD DS administration.\nÂ· Implement and manage OUs.\nÂ· Administer AD DS.",

In traditional IT environments, companies had to purchase and set up physical servers, software licenses, storage and network equipment to scale up business services.\nCost - cloud providers take over maintenance and upgrades, companies migrating to the cloud can spend significantly less on IT operations. They can devote more resources to innovation - developing new products or improving existing products.\nPerformance - migrating to the cloud can improve performance and end-user experience. Applications and websites hosted in the cloud can easily scale to serve more users or higher throughput, and can run in geographical locations near to end-users, to reduce network latency.\nCustomer experience - users can access cloud services and data from anywhere, whether they are employees or customers. This contributes to digital transformation, enables an improved experience for customers, and provides employees with modern, flexible tools",

You do this by running many Virtual Machines on a small number of physical machines by running ESXi (and managed by vCenter). But, how do you get your existing Windows and Linux servers migrated over to your new vSphere environment? The answer is VMware vCenter Converter.\nvCenter Converter can reach out to source Physical Machines (Windows or Linux installed on a PC Server) and clone-and-migrate the entire hardware state (CPU, Memory, Disk, Networking) to a new Virtual machine. This is called a P2V (physical to virtual) migration.\nvCenter Converter can also reach out to source Virtual Machines (Windows or Linux running in a virtual machine) and clone-and-migrate the entire hardware state (CPU, Memory, Disk, Networking) to a new Virtual machine. This is called V2V (virtual to virtual) migration. Converter can migrate most virtual machine sources including VMs running on Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Parallels, VMware Player/Fusion/Workstation, etc.\nYou will learn how to install and configure vCenter Converter, how to reach out to a source machine and profile it, to locate and size a target VM to hold the converted source machine, to monitor the conversion process and what to watch out for as you conduct conversions. You will also learn VMware Converter Best Practices to help ensure a successful conversion - every time!\nThe skills you will acquire in this course will help you complete your server consolidation project and make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.\nAdded Bonus! This course is 100% downloadable. Take it with you and learn on your schedule.",

If you have familiarity with Apple's operating systems from an end-user perspective but need to manage an organization of macOS or iOS endpoints, this course is for you. This course assumes no experience with system administration on Apple platforms so no prior experience is required.\nIf you are new to system administration or just new to administrating Apple operating systems, this course will introduce you to the basic concepts of managing a handful of devices and scales to how to provide effective support to thousands of devices. The course begins by introducing the basics of Apple hardware and local system management. Tools like Apple Remote Desktop, Screen Time and Apple Configurator are used to demonstrate how to manage a small number of devices.\nAs the course continues, you will be building a cloud-based Mobile Device Management environment using the Mosyle MDM platform. You will learn to configure over-the-air activation and device management for iPhone and iPad endpoints including device restrictions, Managed Apple Accounts, managed iOS Apps, and more. You will move on to macOS administration and learn to automate software installations, updates, and customize the user experience using configuration profiles and integrate with Identity Providers like Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on.\nTaking a project-based approach, students will 'code along' to complete seven real-word projects utilizing a variety of the functions of the Mosyle MDM solution.Â  From an employee \"bring your own device\" iPhone management to a zero-touch self-service deployment of a new MacBook to a remote employee, these projects cover many of the most in-demand skills used by Apple system administrators.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will be fully capable of using macOS, Apple Device Enrollment, and Mosyle MDM to administer hundreds or thousands of endpoints across businesses big and small.\n\n\n*Photo by Dmitry Chernyshov on Unsplash",

I am writing this email to give good feedback regarding your course materials that I have watched from Udemy.

Your course has allowed me to obtain a Linux certification and I would like to give a big thanks you for that. Please continue what you're doing and I wish you the very best. -- Yusuf Ishkandersha\n\n\nImran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material. -- Raymond B.\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am getting -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend. -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward. -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you. -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing. -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs terms -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course. -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",

That is, without a display attached in a data center, on a dedicated server machine, or in the cloud. If you're starting a project that needs a server back end or if you want to learn about server administration to advance your education or your career, Ubuntu server is a good choice. Server administrators will need to know how to manage a system's security. And I'll introduce you to setting up users, controlling services, and securing the system's firewall. Working with the resources on the system is also important, so we'll take a look at managing resources and processes.\nAnd then I'll show you the basics of setting up some common services. A web server, a database server, DNS, mail, and more. And before the course ends, I'll introduce you to some of the cloud services that an Ubuntu server administrator should know about.

When you first look at a YAML file, it may appear as though Python and someone's to-do list had a collision. You will gain an understanding of YAML files and get some practice writing in YAML by taking this course, which is titled \"YAML Fundamentals Compete Course\" You will begin by becoming familiar with the fundamental syntax of YAML. After that, you'll learn how to build more advanced structures by applying the fundamental syntax you just learned. After you have finished this training, you will have the knowledge of YAML as well as the abilities essential to use the language effectively in the day-to-day work you do in the information technology business.\nThe following is a synopsis of the topics covered in this class:\nCourse Overview.Â  Basics of YAML Structure\nUsing Online Parsers\nChoosing Text Editors and IDEs for YAML\nThe Problem with Tabs\nCreating a .nanorc File\nCreating a .vimrc File\nUsing VSCode\nAnd moreâ¦\n\n\nFYI: YAMLÂ  is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps thus JSON files are valid YAML",

Group Policy is primarily a security tool, and can be used to apply security settings to users and computers. Group Policy allows administrators to define security policies for users and for computers. These policies, which are collectively referred to as Group Policy Objects (GPOs), are based on a collection of individual Group Policy settings. Group Policy objects are administered from a central interface called the Group Policy Management Console. Group Policy can also be managed with command line interface tools such as gpresult and gpupdate.\n\n\nThe Group Policy hierarchy\nGroup Policy objects are applied in a hierarchical manner, and often multiple Group Policy objects are combined together to form the effective policy. Local Group Policy objects are applied first, followed by site level, domain level, and organizational unit level Group Policy objects.\nThe Group Policy hierarchy\nGroup Policy objects are applied in a hierarchical manner, and often multiple Group Policy objects are combined together to form the effective policy.

Commvault allows you to manage backed-up data and workloads efficiently and securely, both on-premises and in any public cloud. It provides increased visibility and role-based access control that enables self-service, restricting unauthorized access while helping to eliminate data sprawl. This reduces the burden on database administrators, while increasing their efficiency and allowing them to focus more on critical business activities. In addition, Commvaultâs market-tested technology helps organizations extract more business value from that data, to facilitate business planning and to improve business outcomes.\n\n\nCommvault was originally formed in 1988 as a development group in Bell Labs focused on data management, backup, and recovery; it was later designated a business unit of AT&T Network Systems. After becoming a part of Lucent Technologies, the unit was sold in 1996 and became a corporation, with Scotty R. Neal as CEO.\n\n\nIn March 1998, Bob Hammer joined Commvault as chairman, president and CEO, and Al Bunte joined as vice president and COO. In 2000, the company began releasing products aimed at managing network storage. In March 2006, Commvault filed for an initial public offering, and officially went public later that year as CVLT on NASDAQ. At the end of 2013, the company moved from its space in Oceanport, New Jersey, to its new $146 million headquarters at the former Fort Monmouth in Tinton Falls, New Jersey.\n\n\nOn February 5, 2019, Sanjay Mirchandani replaced the retiring Hammer as president and CEO, and Nick Adamo was announced as chairman of the board. Mirchandani joined Commvault from Puppet, an Oregon-based IT automation company, where he served as CEO.\n\n\nSoftware\nCommvault software is an enterprise-level data platform that contains modules to back up, restore, archive, replicate, and search data. It is built from the ground-up on a single platform and unified code base. It has four product lines: Complete Backup and Recovery, HyperScale integrated appliances, Orchestrate disaster recovery, and Activate analytics. The software is available across cloud and on-premises environments.\n\n\nData is protected by installing agent software on the physical or virtual hosts, which use operating system or application native APIs to protect data in a consistent state. Production data is processed by the agent software on client computers and backed up through a data manager, the MediaAgent, to disk, tape, or cloud storage. All data management activity in the environment is tracked by a centralized server, the CommServ, and can be managed by administrators through a central user interface. End users can access protected data using web browsers and mobile devices.\n\n\nIn 2008, Commvault launched a new remote operations management service for storage management for small and midsize businesses. In 2009, the company's backup software product Simpana version 8 offered the industry's first global embedded software deduplication, allowing users to deduplicate data no matter where it is stored. In 2015, following the release of Simpana version 10, the product was renamed Commvault Software. In 2017, Commvault began to sell its Hyperscale Backup data protection appliances, following up a year later by adding high capacity Hyperscale appliances, and the standalone Remote Office Appliance. Also in 2017, Commvault and Cisco Systems announced ScaleProtect, combining HyperScale software reference architecture with the Cisco Unified Computing System, giving enterprise customers the ability to manage secondary data in a cloud-like, on-premises solution. On July 17, 2018, the company announced a newly packaged set of four products under the name Commvault Complete: Commvault Complete Backup & Recovery, Commvault HyperScale, Commvault Orchestrate, and Commvault Activate. On October 14, 2019, Commvault launched Metallic, a SaaS backup and recovery service for the mid-market, allowing customers to backup on-premises data to their own backup system, their public cloud, Metallic's public cloud, or a combination of both.\n\n\nCommvault has partnered with companies including Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, IBM, and Google.\n\n\nServices\nCommvault provides consulting services for customers. The company advises customers with setting up new data management systems from the architecture design to the implementation and monitoring. In the remote managed service, Commvault manages the software in production for their customers.",

      "description": "As part of this course, you will learn most of the important Linux commands that can come in handy while working in Linux-based environments.\nHere are the high-level details of the Linux Commands that are covered as part of this hands-on course.\nYou will get started by having an appropriate environment to practice. Windows users can set up Ubuntu 20.04 using wsl.\nOnce the environment is ready, you will understand how to get started with basic Linux Commands.\nThe most commonly used command in Linux is ls. It is used to list the files. We will see different variations of ls by going through all the relevant arguments.\nOne of the powerful Linux commands and also my favorite is \"find\". It helps us to filter the files and directories based on name, type, modified time, etc. You will learn how to use the find command effectively from the perspective of finding the files based on the criteria.\nAs we understand how to get details related to files and folders in Linux, we will go through the details related to previewing the data in files using important Linux commands such as cat, tail, more, etc. Also, we will review Linux commands such as cut, sort, uniq to process the data. All these commands are typically used against text files.\nAfter going through details related to ls, find commands as well as commands related to processing data in files, we will walk you through the details related to file and folder properties in Linux. You will get an overview of commands such as useradd, userdel, chmod, etc which are typically associated with file permissions.\nOne of the key aspects related to files and folders is to manage them effectively. We will go through the details about managing files and folders using Linux commands such as cp for copy, mv for move or rename, rm for delete or remove, tar to build uncompressed as well as compressed tar balls. Also, you will get a taste of the awk command to automate some of the common tasks such as reorganizing the files based on patterns.\nThe core components of a computer are nothing but CPU, Memory, and Storage. In this section or module, you will be learning Linux commands such as lscpu to get CPUÂ details, free to get memory details, and then df and du to get storage details.\nAt times, we need to make sure the data is in files as well as codebase to troubleshoot the production issues or bugs in QA. In this section, you will learn how to use the Linux command called diff to compare files and folders and review the differences.\nEnvironment Variables are the ones that can impact the sessions logged in by users in Linux. As part of this section, you will be learning details related to Variables, Environment Variables. Also, you will understand how to list all the Environment Variables using Linux commands such env, and how to get a value of a Variable or Environment Variable using the Linux command echo. On top of these things, you will also learn all important aspects related to one of the most important Environment Variables called PATH.\nAs we gain a decent amount of knowledge related to Linux commands using a single server, it is time for us to explore other important commands such as ssh, scp, pssh, pscp, etc which require more than one Linux System or Server. Also, we need to go through basic networking concepts. To learn commands to interact between the servers as well as to understand basic networking concepts, we will get started with AWS to provision Ubuntu-based virtual machines. These Virtual Machines will be used in the subsequent sections to learn the concepts mentioned earlier as part of this bullet point.\nOnce we go through the details about getting started with AWS, we will focus on learning all key concepts related to SSH such as sshd daemon, updating ssh config files, and restarting sshd using systemctl or service command. Also, we will go through the details related to passwordless login and also ability to run commands remotely via ssh. We will also understand how to set up parallel ssh and then run commands on multiple Linux systems in parallel.\nTo be comfortable with learning in a Linux environment, it is very important for one to understand key concepts such as different types of IPÂ Addresses, Port Numbers, relationships between applications and databases with ports, etc. In this section, we will go through all important networking concepts using apache2, MongoDB, etc.\nOnce we are comfortable with SSH, it is time for us to use tools such as scp which uses ssh under the hood to copy files and folders between the Linux Systems. We will also explore parallel scp to copy files in parallel to multiple target systems from one source system. Also, we will go through the details related to speeding up the copy using different techniques which include submitting multiple scp commands using nohup.\nOne of the important aspects for any IT Engineer is to troubleshoot the application issues deployed in Linux by reviewing logs generated by applications. After going through scp, you will learn how to troubleshoot issues by using grep and find against log files of the applications deployed on the Linux Server.\nTo ensure that we can monitor and manage Linux Servers, we not only need to understand how to manage applications and databases in Linux but also need to understand the performance of the applications. For managing applications and databases on a Linux server, one should be familiar with commands such as apt to install applications and systemctl or service to manage the life cycle of applications and databases. To monitor, one should be familiar with commands such as ps, lsof, top, etc. You will learn how to monitor and manage applications as well as databases using examples such as ssh, apache2, mongodb, jupyterlab, etc.\nAs we learned quite a few commands and tools on Linux, now it is time for us to work on increasing productivity by using appropriate tools, especially for Windows users. You will see the relevance and also how to setup tools such as notepad++, winscp, visual studio code with remote development extension, git tools for Windows, etc.\nOrganizations will end up having hundreds of servers to support their applications. However, these hundreds of servers need to follow a handful of templates. Using Server Automation tools like Ansible, we should be able to automate the process of configuring a large number of servers using a handful of templates. You will get an overview of Ansible covering some of the core concepts of Ansible such as running commands, inventory, playbooks, variables, roles, etc.\nAlso, you will understand how to use programming languages like Python to take care of automation by using modules such as os, glob, subprocess, etc.\nBasic Linux Commands\nRunning the first command on Linux\nGetting usage of Linux

      "description": "About This Course is about learning How Linux Processes Talk to each Other. This is a sub-domain of Linux System Programming. We shall explore various popular mechanism used in the industry through which Linux processes to exchange data with each other. We will go through the concepts in detail behind each IPC mechanism, discuss the implementation, and design and analyze the situation where the given IPC is preferred over others.\nWe also discuss how applications should be designed to use IPCÂ facilities provided by underlying Linux OS.\nYou will have Assignments wherever possible, and throughout the course, there shall be one project in which you shall be incrementally applying the new IPC technique you have learned. Towards the end of the course, you would have practiced and applied all IPCÂ techniques learned in this course.\nEach IPC mechanism, we will have a detailed code walk in which I show you how actually a given IPC mechanism is implemented on sending and receiving side.Â  When you would join the industry, from day 1 you will witness IPC concepts being applied all over the software in order to facilitate communication between different parts of the software.\n\n\nWho should do this courseÂ ?\nThis course is meant for UGÂ Computer science students, job seekers, and professional developers. This is a MUST do course for those who want to join MNCs as a developer in System Programming. In System Programming, almost all the time you have to useÂ IPC to carry out data exchange between processes, therefore students graduating in computer science and looking to seek an opportunity in MNCs as a developer should have IPC concepts at his/her fingertips.\n\n\nPre-requisite\nIt shall be advantageous if you know a little about C andÂ OS. We designed this course assuming the student is a complete beginner in Linux IPC and we raise the level of course gradually as we move from Basic to advance concepts wherever necessary.\nAlso, please just do not sit and watch my codes. Write your own codes, even if it is the same as mine!\n\n\nRelatedÂ Courses\nRPC (Remote Procedure Calls) is another way of carrying out Inter-Process Communication between two processes running on separate machines in the network. You may also want to check my other course on Linux RPCs where you will learn how to implement RPCs from scratch.\n\n\nProgramming Language used In this course :\nWe have strong reasons to choose C as a language for this course:\nIPC is a facility provided by the OS to developers to carry out data exchange between processes. Learning IPC using C helps you understand what is going on behind the scenes. C language really exposes the low-level details about how the system actually works. In System programming, C is the only language to be used and there is not even a remote substitute of this language when it comes to System programming.\n\n\nNo Third-Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch. This course does not suggest taking the help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course. However, it is recommended to use third-party libraries for commonly used data structures such as linked lists/Trees/Queues, etc which saves a lot of time implementing these data structures.\n\n\nNote1 : Though we use Linux to teach the IPCÂ techniques, conceptually, IPC of Linux is not very different from other OS platforms such as windows, iOS, etc. So, if you are a programmer for other platforms, this course still holds great value for you.\nNote2 : This Course talks about various techniques regarding exchanging data between processes, the other related topics such as process synchronization and locking is out of the scope of this course and will be covered separately.\nWarning: This course has auto system-generated subtitles which may not be perfect. Please disable subtitles as per your convenience.\n\n\nCurriculum\nIntroduction\nTable of Contents\nComputer Architecture - Overview\nVarious IPC Techniques\nCommunication Types\n\n\nIPC Technique 1 - Unix Domain Sockets\nSocket API Introduction\nSocket Message Types\nSocket Design Paradigm\nAccept System Call\nIntroducing Unix Domain Socket\nUnix Domain Socket Server Implementation\nUnix Domain Socket Client Implementation\nMultiplexing\nSelect System Call\nMultiplexing Server State machine\nMultiplexed Server Implementation\nData Synchronization - IPC Project part 1\n\n\nIPC Technique 2 - Message Queue\nIntroduction\nMsgQ as a Kernel Resource\nOpen & Create a MsgQ\nClosing a MsgQ\nEnque Data in MsgQ\nDequeue Data from MsgQ\nUnlinking a MsgQ\nUsing a Msg Q - Design perspective\nBi-Directional Communication\nCode Walk - Implementation\nDemonstration\n\n\nIPC Technique 3 - Shared Memory\nOverall Design Goals\nConcept of Virtual Memory\nProgram Control Block\nShared Memory Basics\nKernel Memory\nmmap() - Memory Mapping\nDesign Constraint\nShared Memory related APIs\nData Synchronization - IPC Project part 2\n\n\nIPC Technique 4 - Signals\nIntroduction\nLinux Well knows Signals\nSignals Generation and Trapping\nSending Signals using Kill()\nData Synchronization - IPC Project part 3\n\n\n\n\nIPC Technique 5 - Network sockets\nSocket Programming Design\nSelect System call\nAccept System call\nConcept of Multiplexing\nServer State machine\nProject on SocketÂ Programming - IPC Project 4\n\n\nMultiplexing on DifferentÂ IPCs\nUse select() to multiplex on different IPC interfaces",

But it would help you to understand the small things regularly ignored by most writers and content creators. You should never start with learning Linux commands. The starting point should always be the SHELL. That black hole is full of secrets, and this course puts you in the driving seat to navigate the intricacies of the shell and the rest would follow. It is a combination of reading the books attached with the course and watching the video to gain full advantage of this course. If you miss one or the other, you will gain nothing. Life is not a magic, and for most of us, we have to work hard. Don't blame others. Instead, check and identify your faults. Blaming me for your lack of comprehension or language problems will not certainly solve your problems. You must buy the sister courses as well. Life is not a free lunch either. Few of you have left negative marks, while the majority have been truthful. For those few, I am not responsible for the state of your education or your lack of English comprehension! Please be respectful, or please do not take this course. After taking this course, please go ahead and buy my C shell scripting course.",

IÂ have been using Yocto Project for almost 10 years, dating back to my college years.\n\"Applied Yocto Project using Raspberry Pi 5 (with Embedded Linux practices)\" is an unique Embedded Linux course unlike any other. The course utilizes drawings, slideshows, diagrams, examples, hands-on applications in order for you to visualize every subject in your mind with ease. Course level starts with beginner, but some advanced topics are also explained.\nTheoretical subjects are carefully planned and almost for every important subject, multiple block diagrams have been created for better understanding. Almost every figure, schematic, drawing comes from years of experience in the field, not from the internet or from any book. In practical subjects, we take a deep dive in exploring Yocto Project together, and open up a terminal together to achieve things within it.\nAt the end of the course we together will have a custom Linux distribution with distinct machine configuration, kernel, recipe examples, and Qt application.\nYou are in this now for the following great content:\n\nUnderstand the core philosophy behind Embedded Linux systems from Introductory to Advanced subjects.\nUnderstand why we use Embedded Linux in certain products.\nUnderstand how Linux systems and Raspberry Pi 5 boot.\nGrasp how embedded Linux tasks work (unpack, patch, configure, compile, install, deploy, package).\nUnderstand Linux distributions and package managers.\nComfortably handle tasks regarding Yocto Project and its configuration with ease.\nUnderstand how Raspberry Pi 5 layer and board configuration work in Yocto Project (meta-raspberrypi, hardware specs, serial console).\nCreate your own machine configurations within Yocto Project.\nCreate your own layers for your Linux distribution.\nComfortably create new recipes for software packages that use multiple build systems (GCC, GNU Make, CMake, PyPi).\nIntegrate third party software (e.g. GNOME, XFCE, Qt) in Embedded Linux products.\nIntegrate graphical desktop in your Embedded Linux system.\nDeploy system images to Raspberry Pi 5 and work with secure shells and serial console software.\nCreate patches for existing software packages using DEVTOOL.\nUnderstand how to comfortably understand and modify kernel configurations (Kconfig, config fragments).\nDowngrade and upgrade Linux Kernel version of your embedded Linux distribution.\nThank you very much for your interest!

The need for always-on applications in this day and age is at an all-time high, and so is the need for high availability technologies. This course explores preparing, configuring, and managing high-availability technologies in Windows Server 2019.\nCOURSE OBJECTIVE\nThis course explores a range of high availability technologies available in Windows Server 2019 for Hyper-V, as well as other common Windows services. You'll explore the preparation, configuration, and management of Windows Failover Clustering, both with and without Storage Spaces Direct. Later, you'll dive into Storage Replicas, Hyper-V Replicas, Network Load Balancing, Shared Nothing Live Migration, and Stretch Clustering, among a range of supplementary out-of-the-box technologies for Windows workloads. You'll also extend your skills by implementing and managing Failover Clusters and Storage Spaces Direct, and you'll manage VM movement in clustered nodes.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the foundational knowledge to be able to implement a highly available Windows Server 2019 environment like a pro.\nAPPROACH\nThe course takes a hands-on approach with practical demos on each topic performed in its virtual labs. It is recommended that students build their own lab environment (as detailed in Section 1 of the course) and follow along with the demos. The course offers hands-on instructions, interesting and illustrative examples, and clear explanations of each topic.\nYou will learn how to:\nDesign and implement a highly available, modern datacenter\nPlan and implement a highly available disaster recovery solution for your Datacenter\nGain the necessary skills to implement a load balancer solution for your web apps or frontend workloads\nCreate highly available Failover Clusters for your critical workloads including Storage Spaces Direct\nMaster all the skills you need to properly manage your failover clusters\nExplore all the ins and outs of the Hyper-V hypervisor along with its new features introduced in Windows Server 2019\nExplore the built-in monitoring capabilities of Hyper-V on Windows Server 2019\nMaster the skills you need to manage VM movement within a cluster",

      "description": "VMware vSphere 6.0 is the platform businesses depend on to deploy, manage and run their virtualized Windows and Linux workloads.\nIn this course you will learn how to effectively manage host CPU/Memory resources with DRS clusters, to minimize VM downtime caused by ESXi host failures with HA clusters, to eliminate unplanned VM downtime with Fault Tolerance, to patch and update ESXi hosts with VUM and how to maximize ESXi host and VM performance.\nLearn DRS & HA Clusters, Fault Tolerance, VMware Update Manager and Performance\n\nThis course covers five major topics that all vSphere 6 vCenter administrators must know:\n\nWe start with a thorough presentation of VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling (DRS) clusters. DRS clusters dynamically balance VM CPU and memory demands by automatically VMotion migrating VMs experiencing CPU/Memory resource stress. We also look at Enhanced VMotion Compatibility (EVC) - a feature that lets you safely mix newer and older ESXi hosts in a DRS cluster\nNext, we will learn how to minimize VM downtime due to unplanned ESXi host failures by implementing High Availability clusters (HA). HA clusters monitor ESXi host health, detect ESXi host failures and re-assign VM ownership from failed ESXi hosts to healthy ESXi host peers. We will also learn about key HA policies like All Paths Down and Permanent Device Loss handling - new to vSphere 6\nWe move on to look at how to completely eliminate unplanned VM downtime (even if an ESXi host fails) through VMware Fault Tolerance (FT). FT hot replicates a running VM to a peer ESXi host. If the ESXi host running the primary copy of a FT protected VM fails, FT automatically places the replicated copy into service. We'll see how to configure, run and test FT protected VMs.\nNext we will see how to use VMware Update Manager to safely and efficiently patch and update ESXi hosts. We will learn about Patch Baselines (patch sets), how to attach Baselines to an ESXi host or cluster, how to check for patch compliance (all needed patches present on a host) and how to patch ESXi hosts.\nFinally, we will take a close look at ESXi host and VM performance. We will see what the VMkernel does to efficiently utilize physical CPU and how we can right size vCPU in VMs. We will see the five memory management techniques used by the VMkernel to efficiently manage memory and how to turn on Transparent Page Sharing to maximize memory use. We will see how to configure Storage I/O Control and how to identify and fix host and VM performance bottlenecks.\nThe skills you will acquire in this course will help make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.\nAdded Bonus! This course is 100% downloadable. Take it with you and learn on your schedule.",

Marstiller (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material.Â  Â -- Raymond B.Â  (Udemy Student)\n\n\nMain thing about course is its simplicity and the hierarchy. Design is very good and easy which helps to understand things better.Â  -- Akash Garg (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am gettingÂ  -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.Â  -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.Â  -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.Â  -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.Â  -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs termsÂ  -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course.Â  -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to my Linux for Beginners: Linux Basics Course!\nLinux For Beginners covers Linux basics. You will learn Linux fundamental skills; Command line, Linux Administration\n\nIn this course, you will learn Kali Linux fundamentals, how to use basic commands, how Linux File hierarchy is, how to set the network of Linux, how to install packages from package managers and source code, how to manage services, processes and monitoring.\n\nLinux is available in a range of different distributions that are tailored to the needs and skills of its users. Simple distributions, like openSUSE, are great for personal computing, while Linux Ubuntu is ideal for network admins and computer scientists.\nLinux has a somewhat inaccurate reputation as being a much more technical and complex alternative to mainstay operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In reality, Linux is an approachable, open-source, and customizable OS thatâs designed to address huge deficiencies in commercial operating systems.\nOur student says that: I loved this course and it taught me so many things, that now I am very competent in a terminal that has a UNIX background. Almost all of what is taught was transferable to the Mac terminal, and thanks to this course, I can even make my own scripting programs to make my life easier.\nWhat is Linux and why should I use it?\nLinux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nBoth ethical (white hat) hackers and malicious (black hat) hackers often prefer to use the Linux operating system (OS) over Windows OS. The biggest reason hackers turn to Linux is because it is far more accessible to a wider range of people than Windows OS offers. Linux is free, open-source, and provides a well-integrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS. This means anyone can modify Linux to create their own programs and software. Malicious hackers often opt for Linux because it gives them more control when using Linux, and ethical hackers need to be well-versed in Linux because itâs so popular among black hat hackers. Ethical hackers also often prefer using Linux as it has better existing security measures than Windows and doesnât usually require third-party antivirus software.\nHow long will it take to learn Linux and how can I teach it to myself?\nThe time it takes to learn Linux can vary, depending on whether you have existing background knowledge of other operating systems and how deep of an understanding you want to gain. For beginners learning Linux to pursue a career in IT or software administration, you may only need a basic understanding of how to navigate and execute functions using Linux and how applications built on Linux behave. If you plan to become an ethical hacker, or pentester, you may need a more in-depth knowledge of Linux security procedures and a skill in manipulating Linux programs. You can learn Linux on your own time by seeking out video tutorials and online courses. There are plenty of courses available on Udemy that teach the fundamentals of Linux and more advanced Linux skills.\nWhat careers use Linux?\nMany jobs in IT, software development, and cybersecurity rely on Linux skills and expertise. A career in app development generally requires a deep understanding of Linux, as many app developers use Linux as a basis for their applications. Software-focused career paths that frequently use Linux include developer and software engineering roles for Python, Java, and Linux systems. Nearly any role in cybersecurity, such as a penetration tester or ethical hacker, requires a strong knowledge of Linux. With Linux expertise and skills, you could work as a system administrator, IT professional, system architect, or database administrator. You may even work in website development, maintenance, or security, as people in those roles build a majority of their web applications on Linux.\nWhat is the core of the Linux operating system?\nThe core component of any operating system is called the kernel. Linuxâs core is simply referred to as the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a single program that manages crucial tasks such as allocating memory, communicating software functions to the computerâs CPU, and comprehending all of the input and output from the computerâs hardware. The kernel is the most important part of an OS and often runs in a separate area from the rest of a computerâs software. The kernel is just one part of a full operating system, which includes a combination of components such as the bootloader, init system, graphical server, desktop environment, and more. The name âLinuxâ can refer to both the kernel itself (the Linux kernel) and an operating system built around that kernel. For example, the Android OS and the Ubuntu distribution are both made using the Linux kernel.\nWhat are the best Linux distributions for beginners?\nThere is a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from when learning and working with Linux. When you are first learning Linux, the distribution you choose to learn may depend on how you plan to apply your Linux skills. If you are pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you may select a different Linux distribution to start with than someone pursuing a career in game development, for instance. Online courses are some of the best resources for beginners to Linux, as they will give guidance on which Linux distribution is a good fit for the intended application of Linux. For beginners, a few of the most highly recommended Linux distributions include Elementary OS, Ubuntu Linux, and Ubuntu Budgie. Other distributions that are considered easy to learn and master are Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Nitrux, Kodachi, Rescatux, and Parrot Security.\n\nThis course is for beginner level.Â  You will learnÂ step-by-step with hands-on demonstrations.\n\nAt the end of the course you will learn;\nWhat is Linux\nDistributions\nPieces of Linux\nShells\nLinux Signs $,#,%\nDesktop Environments\nLinux GUI\nCommand Parameters\nList Files - \"ls\" Command\nPrint Working Directory - \"pwd\" Command\nShow Manuel - \"man\" Command\nChange Directory - \"cd\" Command\nConcatenate Files - \"cat\" Command\nDisplay Output - \"echo\" Command\nView the File with \"more\" Command\nView the File with \"less\" Command\nPrint First Lines with \"head\" Command\nPrint Last Lines with \"tail\" Command\nGlobal Regular Expression Print - \"grep\" Command\nOutput Redirections\nLinux File Hierarchy\nFile Permissions\nMake Directory - \"mkdir\" Command\nCreate File & Modify Date - \"touch\" Command\nRemove Files or Directories - \"rm\" Command\nCopy and Move Files or Directories - \"cp\" & \"mv\" Command\nFind Files and Directories - \"find\" Command\nCut Parts of Lines - \"cut\" Command\nChange Ownership of a Given File - \"chown\" Command\nNetwork Settings\nDisplay Network Status - \"ifconfig\" Command\nLeasing New IP from DHCP Server\nServices\nUser Management in Linux\nImportant Files - \"passwd\" and \"shadow\"\nAdding a New User\nChange the Group and Delete a User\nProcess Management\nMonitoring Running Processes - \"ps\" and \"top\" Commands\nKilling Processes\nPackage Management\nForemost Linux Package Managers\nRepository\nAPT Package Manager\nInstall From Source Code\nSystem Monitoring\nMonitoring - \"df\", \"top\", \"vmstat\", \"netstat\" CommandsUsing Linux\nUsing linux, kali linux, linux administration, linux command line, kali\nUsing Linux, Linux Certification, Linux Administration, Linux Security, Linux Kernel, Linux Command Line, Kali Linux, Embedded Linux, Comand Line, Bash Shell\nUsing colt steele, rhcsa, ubuntu, red hat, shell script, redhat\nUsing linux system administration, linux server administration, linux server, ubuntu\nUsing Unix, bash, bash script, emacs\nUsing kali linux, oscp, kali, linux, ceh, everything about kali linux os, kali linux tutorial, penetration testing, ethical hacking.\nubuntu linux server, ubuntu server, ubuntu linux, server, linux server, linux administration, linux basics, nagios\nlinux ubuntu linux for beginners ubuntu linux linux basics for beginners linux ubuntu linux for beginers libre office linux beginner linux basics for beginners linux basics ubuntu desktop linux for begineers linux 2021 intro to linux linux basic for beginners libreoffice linux beginners linux academy oak academy linux basics for beginers beginner linux learn linux linux full course linux begineer linux for beginners linux beginer linux basics for beginners ubuntu 20.04 ubuntu for beginners ubuntu course learn ubuntu libre linux course linux linux administration linux administration free linux beginers\n\n\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIt doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn Linux!\nThis course starts withÂ very basics.

Sounds simple when we put it this way but this task is vast. So vast indeed that writing programs that are efficient really depends on how much understanding the engineer has in operating systems.\n\n\nI have been fascinated by revealing and demystifying anything that is hidden from me, mainly because by treating black boxes as black boxes that takes input and produces output, I feel that I am at the mercy of this black box. Databases were a black box for me a decade ago, I was at completely lost when a query that I wrote was originally running fast but after few month it had gone slow. The reason is I didn't really have any understanding of database systems and how their internals work.\n\n\nThe same thing is true for operation systems, we run our program which turns into a process that uses bit of memory and access disk and network but we really don't know how this is done and as a result we as engineers are bound to write inefficient code.\n\n\nI built this course to demystify what I believe are the fundamentals operating systems to software engineers. Like all my courses, I recommend the student having some programming experience to take this course, it just makes the course relatable. I will be using multiple operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac in this course.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy it.",

Let's create and connect RAID arrays, configure replication and monitor the status of hard drives. Let's learn how to work with pools and clusters. Launch the reporting and logging system.We will set up access rights and security, as well as learn how to work with such a cool thing as iSCSI.\nAnd also create a copy of our own company with a centralized network storage of backups and user data, regardless of their client operating system.\nA NAS is a network-attached system that centrally stores data and provides remote access to all authorized users, regardless of the type of client device. NAS systems are highly flexible and scalable, allowing you to add new drives to complement existing drives. NAS is a kind of private cloud for office use. Only it works faster, costs less, makes it possible to locally use all the benefits of the public cloud and at the same time is under the full control of the user.\nNAS systems are ideal for small and medium businesses.\nâ¢ They are easy to use and often do not even require IT intervention.\nâ¢ They are economical.\nâ¢ They provide convenient data backup and availability.\nâ¢ They effectively cope with the task of centralized, reliable and secure data storage.\nWith NAS systems, data is always available, which creates conditions for productive collaboration and quick response to requests from customers and potential buyers, since all information is stored in one place. Since NAS systems are like a private cloud, they provide remote access to data over the network, which means that employees can work from anywhere, whenever they want.",

This course covers four major topics that all vSphere 6 administrators must know:\n\nFirst, we start by learning how to install and configure the ESXi 6.0 hypervisor. From there, we configure ESXi host management networking, join our host to a Windows AD domain, set up time services and much more\nNext, we explore virtual and physical networking. Virtual networking is used to provide Ethernet and TCP/IP networking to VMs. Physical networking is used by both ESXi and VMs to communicate to physical network peers. You will learn to build NIC teams for fast, reliable networking, and how to enable Cisco Discovery Protocol on your virtual Switches\nESXi can use file shares for Virtual Machines, for backups and as a repository for install media images or to hold VM clones or templates. We will see the file choices ESXi supports, how to connect and disconnect from file shares and best practices for achieving both high performance and redundancy\nWe will learn how to build virtual machines. You will learn about the features and capabilities of the virtual hardware layer, how to install a guest OS into your new VM, the purpose and benefits of VMware Tools and how to optimize your VMs for best performance and lowest resource overhead.\nIncluded at the end of each chapter is a series of one or more video demonstrations that show you exactly how to use your new vSphere skills in a live vSphere 6 environment!\nGet in-depth lectures, insights, concepts, how-tos and more.

I needed a good refresh before taking the exam and this course is clearly laid out and copiously covers the material for the exam. Great course, well worth the money! -- M.B.\nPerfect Course - Not only do you get great lectures that are pretty much PowerPoints with an instructor teaching you the concepts, there are also Demo lectures that show you how each of the concepts works in real life. This is such valuable information to have when taking the test. I feel very confident that this course is the best course on Udemy. -- D.R. Jr.\nA Complete Jumpstart - What has impressed me the most is the depth of the content to this coarse. Each HD video is crystal clear in both the visual and audio, even including quality closed captioning (great for reading along with the lectures). I wasn't interested in the flashcards or the crossword puzzles when I started the program, but I've found them to be very useful in staying engaged in the class when away from home. This is everything you need to get started and have a classroom quality experience from home. Dive in and stay focused! -- P.C.",

This course assumes that you are at least above average in programming (in any programming language, but preferable in C/C++) - know memory allocations, all kinds of loops, function calls, pointers etc.Â  In this course, I won't teach C/C++ (there are already many courses on it online) but would teach programming techniques and low-level details regarding how C program works behind the scenes - All topics are very important from an interview point of view. My Target is to grow this course into Linux/C Bible.\n\n\nYet, I always feel, you need to outsmart your fellow colleagues in this era of stiff competition, and therefore, I tried this attempt to present you the wisdom and knowledge which is of utmost importance for a programmer. I have seen though students could write good C/C++ programs, yet they lack the clarity on how one should write better organized, Manageable, extensible, and programmable codes in the form of libraries. For example, Students are too good at competitive programming, yet do not know how to write a simple Makefile, the reason being, Academics do not teach and students do not care to learn.\nIn this course, I will cover the topics related to creating Linux System Libraries (release 1) with Advanced language-agnostic Programming Concepts (release 2) which can be well applied if you happen to become a programmer in other languages tomorrow.\n\n\nThe Concepts like MultiThreading, Thread-Synchronization, Socket Programming, IPCs, etc demand a separate course on each topic altogether. Currently, I have a course on IPC, pls check it out. These topics are out of scope for this course.\n\n\nThe Course shall be delivered into two Releases :\n\n\nRelease 1 Building and Managing a Library:Â  This covers the basics regarding how one should create and organize his code as a Library.\nRelease 2 Memory Management Concepts:Â  This covers Advance concepts on Linux Memory Management specifically. Please check the Table of Contents for more info.\n\n\nWhy you should *NOT* do this course?\n1. Please Excuse this course if you are the ultimate beginner in C programming !!\n2. There is no point of doing this course if you don't like hitting the keyboard, and are lazy enough to watch lecture VDOs only\n3. If you want everything cooked and served on your plate.\n\n\nCourse Pre-requisite :\nAbove Beginners Level in C/C++ programming\nGood to have basic OS knowledge\nZeal to excel and Code\n\n\nNo Third-Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch. Like all my other courses, this course does not suggest taking the help of any third-party library to get the jobs done. The use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course.\n\n\nWarning: This course has auto system-generated subtitles which may not be perfect. Please disable subtitles at your convenience.\n\n\nCurriculum :\n**********************************************\nRelease 1 Building and Managing a Library\n**********************************************\nSection 1 : Introduction to Libraries\nWhat is Library\nRelationship between Library and Application\nEx : Doubly linked list as a Library\nQuick Compilation Steps\nSummary\nSection 2 : Header Files\nRelationship between Source and header files\nText Substitution Method\nText Substitution Method - Example and Demo\nSection 3 : Preprocessing Directives\nProblem of Duplicate inclusion of Hdr files\nPre-processing Directives\nSolution to Duplicate inclusion of Hdr files\nSection 4 : Correct way of Using Structures and Functions\nStructures - Define and Use thumb Rule\nFunctions - Declare and Use thumb rule\nThe problem of Recursive Dependency\nA solution to Recursive Dependency\nSection 5 : Creation of Static and Dynamic Libraries\nResuming with Doubly Linked List Library\nQuick Creation of Static and Dynamic Libraries\nLinking with Static Library\nLinking with Dynamic Library\nSection 7: Understanding four stages of Compilation\nFour stages of C/C++ Compilation\nHow Dynamic Library works ?\nDynamic Linking :Â Linking with Dynamic Library\nComparison - Static Vs Dynamic Linking\nSection 8 : Building using a Makefile\nWhat are Makefiles and why do we need it\nFunctions of Makefile\nMakefile Dependency tree\nSteps of Writing a Makefile\nAssignment on Makefile\nSection 9 : Run-time Programmable libraries\nWhat are Programmable Libraries?\nSteps to Program the libraries\nRegistering of the callbacks with Libraries\nkey_match callback\ncomparison_fn callback\nDelegation of Application-specific operations to Libraries\nSection 10 : Writing Iterators using Macros\nWhat are Iterative Macros ?\nWhy we need Iterative Macros ?\nHow to Write Iterative Macros - For Trees and Linked Lists\nExercises\nSection 11 : Glue Based Libraries and Data structures\nWhat are the Glue Based Libraries?\nIntroducing Glthreads - A Glued LinkedList\nGlthreads Vs Traditional Linked List\nStructure field offset\nGLThreadÂ Operations\nCode Walk\nGLThread Benefits\nSection 12 : Bit Level Programming\nLogical Operators\nImplementing BIT manipulating C macros\nUsing Enums as Bits\nBit Pattern Matching\nBitMaps\n************************************************\nRelease 2 Memory ManagementÂ Concepts\n************************************************\nSection 13 : Memory Layout of Linux Process\nVirtual Memory Basics\nMemory Layout of Linux Process\nExample: Memory Layout of Linux Process\nExercise on size command\nSection 14 : Stack Memory Management\nStack Memory Basics and Contents\nStack-Overflow and Prevention\nStack Memory Corruption\nCommon Cpu Registers\nProcedure Call Mechanism - Step by Step\nPurpose of Base Pointer register (ebp)\nProcedure Return Mechanism - Step by Step\nLab session\nSection 15 : Heap Memory Management\nIntroduction and Goals\nHow Malloc Works\nTop of Heap Memory region - break pointer\nHeap Memory Mgmt Sys Calls - brk and sbrk\nMeta and Data Blocks\nHow free() works\nBlock Splitting\nBlock Merging\nMemory Illness - Problem of Fragmentation\nSection 16 : Concept of Paging\nIntroduction to Paging\nByte Addressable Memory\n32 bit and 64 bit Machine Architecture\nAddress Bus and Data bus\nPhysical Vs Virtual Address\nPhysical Memory Frames\nVirtual Address Composition\nPage Table\nPaging In Action\nShared Physical Memory\nSection 17 : Multilevel Paging\nSection 18 : Demand Paging\nSection 19 : Memory Management for Multi-threaded Process\n\n\n\n\nThe intention of this course is to make you ready for System programming Technical interviews from beginners to upto 8-9 yrs of experience.\n\n\nQ.

First, it's very rare to find courses on more advanced subject matter. As a software developer, I love learning but am often disappointed that Udemy largely has beginner-oriented material (understandably so). Then there's the CSEPracticals courses. I learned a LOT here. This is some valuable, real world stuff. It's incredibly useful to learn how multi-threading in C is actually applied in real world use cases and to implement these use cases on your own. The instruction was clear, the information valuable. The code samples are plentiful. The instructor is clearly very knowledgeable about networking and so the course examples tend to lean in that direction. I'm very impressed and had a LOT of fun with this course. I can't wait to check out the other ones by CSEPracticals.\n\n\nI have just finished this course, and I cannot recommend it more. Its an excellent course on multi-threading and achieves exactly what it intends to from the start. Some features of this course 1) You write a lot of code, and you become more confident in using the pthread library ( along with some other things, I learned how important proper use of assert function can be). 2) Abishekh goes in depth on different synchronization method and shows you have to build them using fundamental tools like mutex and condition variables. This gives you a lot of confidence, and you can build your own in future in case your chosen OS or library does not have those built-in. This in my opinion is the biggest strength of the course. 3) The team of CSE Practicals is very responsive and you can expect to get a response on your queries within a very reasonable time-frame. Ongoing to the course sequel now. Ovais",

What is the data structure employed for Heap Memory Management?\n3. What is the time complexity to allocate memory to a process?\n4. How free( ) knows how much memory to free?\n5. How to get rid of Memory Fragmentation?\n\n\nThis course is about - \"Design and Implement your own Memory Allocation Scheme to address the problem of Memory Fragmentation, see Memory Usage and statistics and Catch Memory Leaks. Talk to your prof and ask to do this project as your Operating Seminar Project\".\n\n\nDo this yet another System Project and Impress the interviewer with your knowledge of System Memory Management.\n\n\nIn this course, weÂ shall design and implement a scheme in the form of a Library that takes the responsibility to allocate &Â de-allocate memory to your userspace process while taking care of the problems of Heap internal and external fragmentation behind the scenes. We already are familiar with the problem of Heap internal and external fragmentation which grows and magnifies over a period of time when a process is in execution and make much of the part of Heap memory unusable.\n\n\nMany companies implement this scheme in the industry in userspace itself to get rid of Fragmentation problems and also speed up the mechanism of Memory (de)allocation to a process.\n\n\nThis is a pure coding based course and at every stage of the course, you need to write a code to implement the project.",

After completing the others, I felt like I was missing the details; like I could work with a K8s Cluster as long as everything is in great shape. But if the slightest gear would crack (which likely may happen, especially when updating K8s), I felt like I did not even have a clue where to start looking at. This course filled the majority of these knowledge gaps for me and I am very happy that I have enrolled in this! Wish this were my first K8s course before enrolling in the others\"\nâââââ \" Amazing! I especially like the part on dissecting the various components of Kubernetes: shut down all the components and starting them one by one to see what each of them does. It gives me a good understanding of how Kubernetes works under the hood. The explanations and demos are also concise and clear. Not to mention the convenient and awesome lab environment. Thank you James for this awesome course!\"\nâââââ \" The course is direct to the point in terms of it being hands-on. You are practically taken through the installations and finally, an outline of the entire deep-dive is shared for better understanding. Also, the quiz and challenges section is detailed in such a way that it would offer one a comprehensive review of the entire course. Great!\"\nâââââ \" Excellent course for those who want to learn basics of Docker and well explained Kubernetes basic concepts including its architecture. Quiz section is just good to evaluate your knowledge and Lab Challenge contains exercise which if you complete properly then you will become confident in Container and Kubernetes concepts.\"\nâââââ \" Clear information, spoken and visual. The content covers a lot of question, the tone is perfect with enough space to be able to follow without replaying any section. I'm delighted.\"\n\nAbout this Course -\n\nKubernetes is the hottest topics in the realm of DevOps and is one of the most demanded skillsets.\n\nThis course fully takes you from ground zero!Â  You'll learn the basics of Containers.Â  You'll learn how to become effective with Docker (how to use Docker to run, manage and even build multi platform containers!).Â  We'll then focus on Kubernetes and by the end of this course you'll also have a solid foundation of Kubernetes and every component that is used.\n\nAlong the way, you'll learn essential skills that will help with all Kubernetes Certification paths.\n\nProvided with this course is an incredible lab environment that will enforce all knowledge in the course as well as quizzes, optional study and optional challenges!\n\nThis course was created based on my own personal frustrations when learning Kubernetes.Â  Many courses and books explain the core components as theory but have little hands on usage or examples of the Kubernetes Architecture\n\nUnderstanding the Kubernetes core components, as well as those that are hidden in the background provides you with a much better understanding of how and why Kubernetes works and will also make you more much effective with Kubernetes!\n\nAfter an overview of the history of Containers, Kubernetes and the relationship to Docker, we'll cover the use of Dockershim, it's deprecation, the inception of Containerd and Runc and we'll configure these as part of our container runtime environment.\n\nWe'll then install and configure Nerdctl, a cli for Containerd that provides the awesome CLI experience that we're used to with Docker!\n\nCNI plugins provide an introduction to the world of Container Network Interfaces.\n\nWe'll build a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm and explore common components and functionality - Pods, the Pause container, Deployments, Replicasets and Services.\n\nWith our Kubernetes cluster running, we'll carefully dismantle the components one by one. We'll then start each component, repeating the functionality that we've explored and will understand, step by step, what each component is and why it's important in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\nWe'll talk through the use of the Kubelet, ETCD, Kube-ApiServer, Kube-Scheduler, Controller-Manager, Kube-Proxy, CoreDNS and Kube-DNS!\n\nLastly there are Quizzes and Challenges to test and take your knowledge further.\n\nYour Instructor, James Spurin -\n\nEmbark on your Kubernetes journey with guidance from a distinguished professional with over 25 years of rich experience across the tech landscape, from leading global engineering teams in prestigious financial services organisations to pioneering developments in Software Development, DevOps, Storage Engineering, and Internet Services.\nJames's expertise is not just recognised but celebrated within the tech community.

Learn Kali Linux from the pros how to use Kali Linux easily and quickly.\nKali Linux Tutorial! Learn from the pros how to use Kali Linux easily and quickly.\nKali Linux, kali, ethical hacking, kali Linux for beginners, Linux, kali Linux tutorial, learn kali Linux, hacking, kali Linux beginner, kali Linux hacking, oak Academy, kismet, ethical hacking using kali Linux, Linux kali, kali Linux full course, kali linux tutorial for beginners, hacking with kali Linux, how to become a hacker, kali Linux 2021, kali Linux 2020, kali Linux hack, Linux for beginners, kali Linux free\n\nToday, many critical systems continue to work on the Linux operating system. Because Linux operating systems are very stable and can work without interruption. With the development of the Internet, Linux operating systems have developed and started to use the Windows concept.\nEthical hacking is a popular expertise thanks to the stylization of white hat hackers as heroes in pop television and movies. In real life, ethical hacking is just as valiant, and Kali Linux is a powerful tool for getting the job done. Udemy features top-rated Kali Linux classes to help you don your white hat.\nKali Linux is a pre-packaged Linux distribution built around the Linux kernel. Kali Linux is designed specifically for ethical hacking and penetration testing tasks, and features a host of free and open-source security tools and applications like Metasploit and Nmap.\n\nLinux is available in a range of different distributions that are tailored to the needs and skills of its users. Simple distributions, like openSUSE, are great for personal computing, while Linux Ubuntu is ideal for network admins and computer scientists.\nLinux has a somewhat inaccurate reputation as being a much more technical and complex alternative to mainstay operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In reality, Linux is an approachable, open-source, and customizable OS thatâs designed to address huge deficiencies in commercial operating systems.\nOur student says that: I loved this course and it taught me so many things, that now I am very competent in a terminal that has a UNIX background. Almost all of what is taught was transferable to the Mac terminal, and thanks to this course, I can even make my own scripting programs to make my life easier.\nWhat is Kali Linux?\nKali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution released in March of 2013, primarily created for advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It used to be known as BackTrack Linux. Kali Linux contains hundreds of tools that perform various information security tasks, such as computer forensics, reverse engineering, security research, and penetration testing. It provides a multi-platform solution that is freely available and accessible to both professionals and hobbyists in the information technology industry.\n\nWhat is Linux and why should I use it?\nLinux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nBoth ethical (white hat) hackers and malicious (black hat) hackers often prefer to use the Linux operating system (OS) over Windows OS. The biggest reason hackers turn to Linux is because it is far more accessible to a wider range of people than Windows OS offers. Linux is free, open-source, and provides a well-integrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS. This means anyone can modify Linux to create their own programs and software. Malicious hackers often opt for Linux because it gives them more control when using Linux, and ethical hackers need to be well-versed in Linux because itâs so popular among black hat hackers. Ethical hackers also often prefer using Linux as it has better existing security measures than Windows and doesnât usually require third-party antivirus software.\nHow long will it take to learn Linux and how can I teach it to myself?\nThe time it takes to learn Linux can vary, depending on whether you have existing background knowledge of other operating systems and how deep of an understanding you want to gain. For beginners learning Linux to pursue a career in IT or software administration, you may only need a basic understanding of how to navigate and execute functions using Linux and how applications built on Linux behave. If you plan to become an ethical hacker, or pentester, you may need a more in-depth knowledge of Linux security procedures and a skill in manipulating Linux programs. You can learn Linux on your own time by seeking out video tutorials and online courses. There are plenty of courses available on Udemy that teach the fundamentals of Linux and more advanced Linux skills.\nWhat careers use Linux?\nMany jobs in IT, software development, and cybersecurity rely on Linux skills and expertise. A career in app development generally requires a deep understanding of Linux, as many app developers use Linux as a basis for their applications. Software-focused career paths that frequently use Linux include developer and software engineering roles for Python, Java, and Linux systems. Nearly any role in cybersecurity, such as a penetration tester or ethical hacker, requires a strong knowledge of Linux. With Linux expertise and skills, you could work as a system administrator, IT professional, system architect, or database administrator. You may even work in website development, maintenance, or security, as people in those roles build a majority of their web applications on Linux.\nWhat is the core of the Linux operating system?\nThe core component of any operating system is called the kernel. Linuxâs core is simply referred to as the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a single program that manages crucial tasks such as allocating memory, communicating software functions to the computerâs CPU, and comprehending all of the input and output from the computerâs hardware. The kernel is the most important part of an OS and often runs in a separate area from the rest of a computerâs software. The kernel is just one part of a full operating system, which includes a combination of components such as the bootloader, init system, graphical server, desktop environment, and more. The name âLinuxâ can refer to both the kernel itself (the Linux kernel) and an operating system built around that kernel. For example, the Android OS and the Ubuntu distribution are both made using the Linux kernel.\nWhat are the best Linux distributions for beginners?\nThere is a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from when learning and working with Linux. When you are first learning Linux, the distribution you choose to learn may depend on how you plan to apply your Linux skills. If you are pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you may select a different Linux distribution to start with than someone pursuing a career in game development, for instance. Online courses are some of the best resources for beginners to Linux, as they will give guidance on which Linux distribution is a good fit for the intended application of Linux. For beginners, a few of the most highly recommended Linux distributions include Elementary OS, Ubuntu Linux, and Ubuntu Budgie. Other distributions that are considered easy to learn and master are Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Nitrux, Kodachi, Rescatux, and Parrot Security.\nAdvanced computer knowledge is no longer required to use a Linux operating system.\n\nAnyone at the beginner level can take this course. And this course will take you even further. This course is a practical course. You'll learn some theory first and then have the chance to apply what you've learned.\n\nIn the \"Kali Linux For Beginners\" course, you will learn;\nHow to install Kali Linux?\nWhat are default Kali Linux programs and how to use them?\nHow to set up a new program?\nHow are updates of existing programs done?\nYou will learn how to change the Kali LinuxÂ  installation settings.\nHow to use the terminal?\nkali linux kali ethical hacking kali linux tutorial linux hacking tcpump career hacking learn kali linux muharrem aydin linux hacking kali linux course ddos kali linux hacking ethical hacking kali linux linux expert john the ripper ethical hacker kali linux start your maltego start kali linux kali linux hack kali linux ethical hacking kali linux for hacking linux for hackers kalilinux kali linux full course csi linux kali linux certified professional hashcat kali linux beginner ethical hacking with kali free ethical hacking kali linux tutorial for beginners social engineering kali hacking kali linux for ethical hacking hacking with linux\n\nAt the end of this course;\nYou will be able to change the Kali Linux operating system settings,\nYou will learn how to use the necessary programs for your daily work.\nYou will learn how to run the most used hacker programs.\nUsing linux, kali linux, linux administration, linux command line, kali\nkali linux, oscp, kali, linux, ceh, everything about kali linux os, kali linux tutorial, penetration testing, ethical hacking.\nThe instructor does a great job of explaining Linux commands using small and concise examples.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of the teacher.

But really where do I go from here? and when I find the problem what do I really need to do? Mike really shows you the nitty gritty.\"\n\"This was just the course I have been waiting for. Mike's demos and scripts have helped me become a confident tuner. The best thing about this course was that I was able to improve our server performance straightaway.\"\n\"I already have a great deal of DBA related experienced in the real world. What this course did for me was help me establish a model, and strategy for database tuning and performance monitoring.\"\n\"After taking this course not only will you have a sound performance tuning strategy and be well equipped to establish baselines and apply performance tweaks on your servers, but more importantly, you'll have a strong performance tuning foundation and be poised to take your new skills and understanding to the next level. At such a low price, this course is a no-brainer whether you're a junior or senior DBA. I'm so impressed with the course\" - Jamar\n\nThank you reviewers for your kind feedback.\nThis course focuses on making SQL Server more performant.\nSQL Server is like a high performance sports car. Anyone can drive it but put it in the hands of a skilled performance tuner and you've just gone from average to incredible.\nNo one wants an average performing system and with the KNOWLEDGE acquired from THIS COURSE your performance tuning acumen won't be average either.\nThis course will give YOU the foundation to become a skilled PERFORMANCE TUNER.\nWE will start by building a baseline. How can you measure YOUR success without knowing how poorly the system was before you arrived?\nBaselines give us a before and after snapshot of the system we are going to tune.\nOnce thought of as an art, performance tuning is nothing more than a series of processes that seek to accomplish TWO basic goals.\nThe FIRST one is to increase the response time for a given transaction or set of transactions.\nThe SECOND one is reduce resource consumption. On the surface this sounds simple but nothing could be further from the truth.\nA database is a collection of objects. The most fundamental and most important is the table object. Users interact with tables via transactions. Most online transaction processing databases are read and write heavy. We put data into to our tables or INSERT it and we read that data or SELECT it.\nLet's use an online ordering system as an example. I need a product and I've found it on x(dot)com. Before I can order it I need to give x(dot)com a few things. My name, address, product I'm ordering and money of course. All this information is INSERTED into various tables. Once I've provided all the necessary information someone at x(dot)has to SELECT or read that data so my order can be filled.\nImagine for a minute that I make several attempts to provide x(dot)com with my name, addressâ¦ etc. However, after three attempts the information can't be saved to the database and I receive multiple errors. Most people won't try three times unless the product can't be purchased somewhere else. Most users will look elsewhere after that second failure.\nThis course WILL provide YOU with the foundation necessary to ensure data can be saved and retrieved so the database will have an organic flow of transactions.\nENROLL now. Let's get started!!!",

      "description": "You will learn about vSAN concepts like Hyrbird and All-Flash architectures, Storage Policies, how to create a vSAN cluster, how vSAN handles failures, and much much more.\n*** if you have any questions or need help you can contact me over my LinkedIn ***\nVMware vSAN (formerly Virtual SAN) is a hyper-converged, software-defined storage (SDS) product developed by VMware that pools together direct-attached storage devices across a VMware vSphere cluster to create a distributed, shared data store. The user defines the storage requirements, such as performance and availability, for virtual machines (VMs) on a VMware vSAN cluster and vSAN ensures that these policies are administered and maintained.\nvSAN is part of the VMware ESXi kernel and runs on industry-standard x86 servers from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including Cisco, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Fujitsu, Lenovo and Supermicro. Because vSAN is a native component, it does not require additional software, and the user can enable it with a few clicks.\nThe distributed architecture of VMware vSAN enables the parameters of the storage policy to be enforced despite changes in virtual machine (VM) workload demands or hardware or network failures. The vSphere Web Client handles cluster administration and storage policy implementation.\nvSAN supports both hybrid and all-flash configurations using a two-tier architecture. Both configurations use a caching tier and a capacity tier. The caching tier is composed of at least one flash device per host. The capacity tier is composed of at least one flash device (for all-flash) or one magnetic disk (for hybrid) per host. vSAN combines the host's storage resources into a single, high-performance, shared data store that all the hosts in the cluster can use.\nImportant features\nVMware vSAN includes a number of key features, although the feature set varies depending on the license type. Some of vSAN's key features are Storage Policy-Based Management, stretched clusters, checksum and software-defined data-at-rest encryption which does not require self-encrypting drive (SEDs).\nvSAN 6.6 claims to deliver 50% more IOPS than previous versions of vSAN because of the way it minimizes storage latency through the use of server-side flash devices. It also includes a new health check feature that enables the administrator to see at a glance whether or not the vSAN cluster is healthy and, if it detects a problem, help diagnose the issue.\nA vSAN cluster can include between 2 and 64 nodes. The vSAN 6.6 Enterprise license offers stretched clusters with local site protection, and native data-at-rest encryption designed to achieve higher availability and security with minimal CPU overhead. Both Advanced and Enterprise licenses support deduplication, compression and erasure coding data services for all-flash configurations. Erasure coding can be configured with either single or double parity protection against disk failures.\nAll the vSAN licenses also offer support for storage quality of service (QoS), which enables an administrator to place limits on the number of IOPS that specific VMs can consume.",

From those screenshots, we have created course videos. Please remember that creating course using this approach took significant more time that otherwise would have taken. Now question arises why we have taken this approach?\nKubernetes is a complex concept involving many components. Understanding how these components work individually and in combination is necessary for understanding Kubernetes. For understanding complex relation among different building blocks of Kubernetes, creation of high quality diagrams is must.\nIn this course, we have created 3 node Kubernetes cluster using three virtual machines (VMs). Now when we create pods (using Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, DaemonSet objects), these are given unique IP address, name and scheduled on nodes dynamically. So when we first took screenshots, we were able to create exact diagrams based on IP, Name, Node allocated. After that we created course videos. Same is true when we talk about Kubernetes service object.\nWe have checked the effectiveness of this approach many times when taking online classes. This approach was very effective in making people understand Kubernetes properly.\nIf you are not convinced about the effectiveness of this approach, then we will suggest that this course is not for you. The following will be covered\n\n\nKubernetes Introduction and Installation\n- Docker Introduction\n- Kubernetes Installation\nKubernetes Pods\n- Pod Basics\n- Creating and Managing Pods\nKubernetes ReplicaSets\n- ReplicaSet Introduction\n- Create ReplicaSets\nKubernetes Deployments\n- How to create deployments\n- How to scale up\nCustom Images\n- How to create custom Docker images\n- How to push/pull/verify custom images\nDeployment Strategy\n- Rolling Update\n- Fixed\n- Blue Green\n- Canary\nHealth Probes\n- Readiness Probes\n- Liveness Probes\nKubernetes Services\n- ClusterIP\n- NodePort\n- LoadBalancer",

Official ports are available for some Unix-like platforms, with work-in-progress ports to Classic Mac OS and macOS, and unofficial ports have been contributed to platforms such as Symbian, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.\nPuTTY supports many variations on the secure remote terminal, and provides user control over the SSH encryption key and protocol version, alternate ciphers such as 3DES, Arcfour, Blowfish, DES, and Public-key authentication. It also can emulate control sequences from xterm, VT102 or ECMA-48 terminal emulation, and allows local, remote, or dynamic port forwarding with SSH (including X11 forwarding). The network communication layer supports IPv6, and the SSH protocol supports the zlib@openssh delayed compression scheme. It can also be used with local serial port connections.\nPuTTY comes bundled with command-line SCP and SFTP clients, called \"pscp\" and \"psftp\" respectively, and plink, a command-line connection tool, used for non-interactive sessions.\nPuTTY consists of several components:\nPuTTY: the Telnet, rlogin, and SSH client itself, which can also connect to a serial port\nPSCP: an SCP client, i.e. command-line secure file copyPSFTP: an SFTP client, i.e. general file transfer sessions much like FTPPuTTYtel: a Telnet-only clientPlink: a command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends\nPageant: an SSH authentication agent for PuTTY, PSCP and Plink\nPuTTYgen: an RSA, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA key generation utility\npterm: a standalone terminal emulator",

      "description": "Are you looking to advance your career in Information Technology and build a solid foundation for your IT journey? You're in the right place, and you might be wondering why. This video will serve as an excellent guide for you.\n\n\nBecoming an IT specialist requires starting from the basics. You need to master computers and everything related to information technology, including how they function, the installation of operating systems like Windows on machines, their communication protocols, how to manage them, and how to troubleshoot hardware issues. Additionally, you should understand the importance of learning how users are managed through a network, including user account permissions, passwords, and accessâall managed through Active Directory.\n\n\nThese topics are some of what we will cover in this course. We'll discuss Domain Controllers, network configuration, DNS records, Active Directory Users and Computers, Trust Relationships, Group Policy, Bitlocker configuration, and Disk Management.\n\n\nThis video tutorial will focus more on practical applications and less on theory.\n\n\nThe course is structured to provide you with the fundamental knowledge required for installing, configuring, and managing Windows Server and Client Operating Systems.\n\n\nGiven that over 90% of the course content is hands-on training, I strongly encourage you to have a test PC with virtualization software installed. This will enable you to apply and practice everything we cover in this video.\nThe training guidelines for this video will be the following:\n1. Install and configure domain controllers for company 1 and company 2\n2. Install and configure DNS servers\n3. Create and configure DNS zones and records\n4. Configure reverse lookup zone\n5. Add Secondary Active Directory Domain controller\n6. Configure Forward lookup zone\n7. Create and manage Active Directory groups and organizational units (OUs)\n8. Create and manage Active Directory users and computers\n9. Configure two Trust relationship between the two companies\n10. Configure service authentication and account policies\n11. Create and manage Group Policy Objects\n12. Configure BitLocker policy for all client devices\n13. How to Configure Disks and Volumes in Windows Server",

      "description": "To effectively secure the networks of today requires the establishment of the hacker mindset. That is, you have to attack your own network to learn how to defend it. A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, pentest or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.\nIn this course you learn how to conduct a pentest and what cybersecurity is all about.Â  You will learn how to build and hone the skills to create that mindset of someone who has the sole purpose of attacking a system and/or network. Following the initial skill development, you will learn the process and methodology of professional penetration testing.\nYou will build the skills and apply techniques to penetrate devices, servers, and clients. Each day you will be presented a scope of work and have a number of targets to engage and attempt to âown.â The targets will be progressive in nature with the size of the attack surface being reduced as your skill sets increase.\nBy the time you leave the course, you will have performed a number of simulated professional penetration testing engagements as well as drafted a preliminary report of findings. The processes and techniques you will be exposed to have been used to train a number of global penetration testing teams. The system is proven and effective and can be put into place at once.\nYour instructor, Kevin Cardwell, is a former senior U.S. Navy cybersecurity expert and the author of multiple books on cybersecurity.\n\nMore about this course and Starweaver\nThis course is led by a seasoned technology industry practitioner and executive, with many years of hands-on, in-the-trenches cybersecurity work. It has been designed, produced and delivered by Starweaver. Starweaver is one of the most highly regarded, well-established training providers in the world, providing training courses to many of the leading financial institutions and technology companies, including:\nAhli United Bank; Mashreqbank; American Express; ANZ Bank; ATT; Banco Votorantim; Bank of America; Bank of America Global Markets; Bank of America Private Bank; Barclay Bank; BMO Financial Group; BMO Financial Services; BNP Paribas; Boeing; Cigna; Citibank; Cognizant; Commerzbank; Credit Lyonnais/Calyon; Electrosonic; Farm Credit Administration; Fifth Third Bank; GENPACT; GEP Software; GLG Group; Hartford; HCL; HCL; Helaba; HSBC; HSBC Corporate Bank; HSBC India; HSBC Private Bank; Legal & General; National Australia Bank; Nomura Securities; PNC Financial Services Group; Quintiles; RAK Bank; Regions Bank; Royal Bank of Canada; Royal Bank of Scotland; Santander Corporate Bank; Tata Consultancy Services; Union Bank; ValueMomentum; Wells Fargo; Wells Fargo India Solutions; Westpac Corporate Bank; Wipro; and, many others.\nHappy learning.",

You will learn about the different types of interrupts, such as Level Triggered and Edge Triggered, as well as Traps and Faults. The curriculum covers the hardware components responsible for interrupt management, including the Programmable Interrupt Controller and the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC). You will also learn how to use the CPUID instruction to find information about your x86 CPU.\nThe course will guide you through the complete interrupt handling process, from the initial Interrupt Request to how the CPU uses the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to locate the correct handler. You will also explore practical topics like interrupt sharing and IRQ Affinity in the Linux kernel. The course includes hands-on experience, such as writing a Linux driver for devices and creating a simple keylogger to log typed characters. You will also learn about enabling and disabling interrupts and why you should avoid adding sleep or delays in an interrupt handler.\nA significant portion of the course is dedicated to the concept of Top and Bottom Halves, which are used for deferred work. You will learn the distinctions between softirqs, tasklets, and workqueues and when to use each for optimal performance. The course also teaches you how to use various files in the /proc filesystem and commands like watch and dmesg to analyze interrupt behavior and debug issues, providing a practical foundation for working with kernel-level programming.",

Marstiller (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material.Â  Â -- Raymond B.Â  (Udemy Student)\n\n\nMain thing about course is its simplicity and the hierarchy. Design is very good and easy which helps to understand things better.Â  -- Akash Garg (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am gettingÂ  -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.Â  -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.Â  -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.Â  -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.Â  -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs termsÂ  -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course.Â  -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",

      "description": "A trending practice as of late by IT departments in mid-large sized organizations is to utilize Microsoft Intune for Apple device deployment. The thinking goes, they already own licenses of Intune as part of the various Microsoft 365 subscriptions so why not use that to manage iPhones and Macs instead of purchasing and supporting yet another tool specific to Apple platforms? That seems like sound logic, but with a focus on Intuneâs cross-platform capabilities, most of the courses out there provide some information on Apple device management using Intune â but nothing goes extremely in-depth on how to use this tool to do the most common Apple deployment tasksâ¦until now.\nManaging Apple Devices in the Enterprise (2024) is solely devoted to Apple device configuration and support. With over 13 hours of content, 6 real-world projects, and a lot of in-depth explanation of key Apple device management concepts, it is one of the most comprehensive resources for managing Macs and iOS devices using the Microsoft Endpoint toolset. With a focus on balancing device security and user experience, this course covers the essential strategies, tools, and best practices for configuring Apple devices, including iPhones and MacBooks, to work seamlessly with Microsoft 365 services. Central to the curriculum is the use of Microsoft Intune, a tool for managing Apple endpoints in alignment with an organization's existing support framework for Windows PCs.\nUsing a mix of both lectures and project-based practical exercises, students will learn the overall process for managing Apple platforms in larger organizations. Once students have mastered the basic concepts, they can 'code-along' with several class projects to build \"Pilot Deployments\" in their own Microsoft Intune tenant. These projects are based on some of the most common scenarios that system administrators handle every day including Mobile Application Management (MAM), Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Shared iPad, and zero-touch Mac deployment.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, learners will:\n\n\nUnderstand the fundamentals of Apple device architecture and its compatibility with Microsoft environments.\nGain expertise in using Microsoft Intune for the effective management of Apple devices within an enterprise setting.\nLearn to configure Apple devices to seamlessly integrate with Microsoft services, including Office 365, Exchange, and Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) using Federation and Platform SSO.\nConfigure Account Driven User Enrollment for BYOD.\nDevelop skills in deploying, managing, and securing Apple devices using policies and profiles standardized across the organization.\nImplement best-practices for network performance and data security for Apple devices on corporate networks.\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the course, participants will receive a certification of completion, demonstrating their competence in integrating Apple devices with-in Microsoft-driven enterprise environments using Microsoft Intune.",

Marstiller (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material.Â  Â -- Raymond B.Â  (Udemy Student)\n\n\nMain thing about course is its simplicity and the hierarchy. Design is very good and easy which helps to understand things better.Â  -- Akash Garg (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am gettingÂ  -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.Â  -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.Â  -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.Â  -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.Â  -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs termsÂ  -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course.Â  -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",

Design is very good and easy which helps to understand things better.Â  -- Akash Garg (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am gettingÂ  -- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.Â  -- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)\n\n\nThe course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.Â  -- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)\n\n\nSuch an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.Â  -- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)\n\n\nIn the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.Â  -- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)\n\n\nI genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future. This has been so informative. You hear the name oracle all the time, but this was well put in laymanâs termsÂ  -- Atoofa Hasan (Classroom Student)\n\n\nImran Afzal eats, breathes and sleeps Linux! He really knows his stuff. I feel like he has brought me from a novice level education to masters level in a short time period. Anyone who is looking to get a job in Linux should definitely take this course.Â  -- TJ Walker (Udemy Student)",
