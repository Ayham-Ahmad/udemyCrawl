      "description": "The role of Support in League of Legends is arguably the easiest to learn and the hardest to master. As League of Legend players, we have all experienced the struggles that come with an unbalanced team, especially in the absence of a soild support player. In this course you will discover that the role of support is more than just warding for your team and assisting your ADC in lane. Support heroes are the backbone of breakout team fights and often determine the outcome based on their ability to play the role properly, so mastering the skills associated with support heroes will be a core focus of this course.\nIf you are considering picking up a new champion to play with, Alistar currently sits at one of the top five most picked supports and remains a staple in the meta throughout the constant shifts and patches introduced to League of Legends. Further, Alistar is considered on of the most versatile supports with his ability to shift between the roles of: frontline tanking, initiating, peeling for ADC, tower diving and anti-crowd control.\nThe Instructor – Lohpally\nLohpally  – Challenger tier Support player & partnered streamer on Twitch\nLohpally has been playing League of Legends since the game was released in 2009 and has been in Challenger tier every season following the launch of the game. In the past, Lohpally’s professional career includes playing for teams such as: Curse, Complexity, and Winterfox. Currently, Lohpally focus on educational streams on Twitch and coaching.

By making the video's short and with tons of exercises you will learn to play chess. Enjoy the beauties of chess today and start your journey with this course.\nMy name is Tom Meurs. I am a chess player from the Netherlands, playing for almost 20 years. I love the game, not only is it intellectually challenging, it is at times beautiful and asks a lot of creativity. Every time I think I resolved the chess mysteries, I get in some strange position with some very unexpected turns. This keeps chess very exciting. Now, I love to share my passion about chess, and I think Udemy is a great platform to give people a taste of the world of chess. That's basically what I try to do in this course: there is everything to get a good foundation for playing and studying chess on your own, with friends or at the club.\nThis course is different then other courses about learning the game of chess:\n1) I try to keep the video's as short as possible, without skipping any important topics. This makes the course easy and fun to watch.\n2) After (almost) every video, there is a quiz to test your knowledge and understanding. Do you just know the concepts? Or can you apply them to new positions? This is the true goal of learning: acquiring knowledge which results in better decision making. This course aims at understanding, not just knowledge.\n3) 'Formula' sheets to remind you of the most important rules.\n\n\nWITHIN THIS COURSE YOU GET:\nVideo's: During this course I will guide you step-by-step to play chess and play it well with the help of video's. I will shortly explain a new concept, why it is important and then try to present situations in which this concept can be applied.\nQuizzes: Chess is all about skill. Not only do you need to know something (=knowledge), but you also need to know when and how to apply it in your games (=skill). This course was especially designed to test your knowledge, so every chess video is coupled with a quiz.\nFormula sheet: To keep all the information sorted, a formula sheet will remind you of the key concepts and rules.\nBonus lectures: in the bonus lectures I focus on covering some different chess formats, to spice up your game and show you how to play chess online for free.\n\n\nYOU'LL ALSO GET:\nLifetime access to World of Chess 1\nFriendly support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion available for download\n30-day money back guarantee\nEnroll Today!\nI Would love to welcome you to the world of chess.\n- Tom",

      "description": "This course will help you understand what to do when two pawns are left on the board.\nIt is a logical continuation of the course I dedicated to a one-pawn endgame, as well as the Understanding Chess Endgames | Two pawns. Part 1\nI checked all the books on pawn endgames that I studied myself and selected all the important positions for you.\nI also added some of the positions that, in my view, were missing from the books I studied.\n\n\nI dedicated Part 1 of the series to all the relevant positions when the two pawns are standing on the same file or the files next to one another. In other words, we did not really have any passed pawns.\n\n\nThis course fills that gap. However, the problem with the passed pawns is that they can be promoted to a queen! :-)\nThat is why I am starting the course with the queen endgames. Only when you know what to do with the queens you will know what to do with your pawns.\n\n\nYou will deliver checkmates, you will survive against the queen using stalemates. You will use beautiful chess geometry (not mathematical geometry) to catch the passed pawn two moves away from your king!\n\n\nYou will understand the hardest pawn endgame that I have ever solved.  It will be a culmination of the ideas you will learn in this course. The beauty of the puzzle is that it contains only two kings and two pawns. And yet, it is filled with a lot of ideas from all the courses I dedicated to pawns.\n\n\nYou will also get interactive access to all the positions described in the course on the free (and ad-free) website (lichess) where you will be able to analyze the positions online. This will deepen your understanding of endgames in general.\n\n\nMany of the principles and ideas taught in the course apply to endgames with many more pieces and pawns on the chessboard.\nThe knowledge you will get from this course you will be able to use in any endgame you encounter!\n\n\nLearn and Master Pawn Endgames (Two Pawns | Part 2) with a Successful Grandmaster\n\n\nLearn what to do with your passed pawn and with your opponent's passed pawn\nStudy how to win with the queen against the pawn\nFind out which pawns can hold a draw against the queen\nAnticipate your opponent's actions to win the game\nWin in queen endgames by winning the queen or giving checkmate\nLearn to use the principles of a square, shouldering, helping from the side, stalemate, and many others\nDiscover the brilliant Reti principle which violates the rules of geometry\n\n\nThis course will enhance your understanding of the fascinating world of chess endgames.\n\n\nThe course consists of 9 sections.\nSection 1 | Introduction: You will learn what this course is all about. There you will also find my position on the russian war against Ukraine.\nSection 2 | Queen wins the Queen: You will learn when the queen can win the queen.\nYou will also learn how to take this information into account many moves ahead to secure your queen.\nSection 3 | Queen vs Pawn. The King is far away: You will discover when you can win with the queen against the pawn on the 2nd(7th) rank. You will learn against which pawns you cannot win with the queen.\nSection 4 | Queen vs Queen. Checkmate ideas: You will learn when you can checkmate the king when there are only queens on the chessboard.\nSection 5 | Queen vs Pawn. The King is close: You will understand when can you win against the pawn that can generally draw against the queen. Here, you will use the checkmate ideas and the stalemate ideas you have learned before.\nSection 6 | Pawn vs Pawn. Races. Promotion: You will find out when the pawn is far from promotion and yet it is a draw against the queen. You will learn how to successfully interfere with your opponent's plans with your king. You will deliver some beautiful checkmates on the way. Also, you will understand the solution to the hardest pawn endgame ever. It only has two pawns and yet even GMs are struggling with it!\nSection 7 | Pawn Races. No Obstacles: You will find out a few key ideas about the pawn races with no or little obstacles in the way.\nSection 8 | Rule of a Square. Reti Principle. The King is going in two directions at once:  You will learn to win tempos with your king to still make it to the square of your opponent's passer. You will enjoy the fascinating Reti principle. You will discover even bigger beauty in the improved Reti position. You will also learn when the Reti idea does not work. You will learn to dance with your king. You will be able to use most of the principles discussed in this and previous courses. Finally, you will use all the knowledge you got from the pawn endgame courses to deliver a surprising checkmate to the king in the last puzzle.\n\n\nSection 9 | Short Conclusion: You will hear the course summary. In the attachment, you will find a link to the free lichess study, where you can check all the positions discussed in the course.\n\n\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n- Beginner/hobby chess players who want to understand chess endgames better\n- Chess enthusiasts who are ready to build a foundation for their endgame play\n- Anyone who is interested in improving their endgame play\n- Chess players who want to play well and evaluate pawn endgames in a matter of seconds",

We’ll explore how quieter lines, like the Giuoco Pianissimo (with d3 and c3), have become increasingly popular among top players seeking strategic depth while avoiding the highly theoretical Ruy Lopez.\nDealing with Deviations: Learn how to safely navigate second-move deviations like the Elephant Gambit and Latvian Gambit, so you can confidently steer the game back to your Italian Game setup.\nLifetime Repertoire: The Italian Game isn’t just a beginner’s opening—it’s a solid and reliable repertoire that can serve you well throughout your entire chess career.

      "description": "Welcome to \"The Complete Guide to Winning Chess Sacrifice Tactics,\" an in-depth and comprehensive chess course designed to transform your understanding of chess tactics, strategy, and the art of sacrifice. This course is ideal for beginner to intermediate players rated between 0 and 1600 who are looking to sharpen their skills, gain confidence, and learn how to use sacrifices to dominate their games. Whether you play online, over-the-board, in casual games, or rated tournaments, mastering sacrifices is a powerful way to outplay opponents and create unforgettable combinations on the board.\nSacrifices are among the most thrilling and instructive elements in chess. In this course, we go far beyond the basics of trading material. We explore how chess sacrifices can disrupt your opponent's plans, open critical lines, remove key defenders, destroy king safety, and convert positional pressure into tactical brilliance. By learning how to evaluate, calculate, and execute sacrifices, you will take your game to a whole new level.\nThroughout the course, we focus heavily on real examples from master-level and world championship chess games, particularly the games of Alexander Alekhine, one of the greatest attacking players and combination artists in chess history. Alekhine's sacrifices were often logical, sound, and deeply instructive, making them perfect models for players seeking to improve. His games are rich in themes such as deflection, clearance, overloading, domination, and classic checkmating patterns.\nIn addition to Alekhine, we draw on examples from a wide range of legendary chess players including Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Paul Morphy, Bobby Fischer, Rashid Nezhmetdinov, Garry Kasparov, AlphaZero, and Aron Nimzowitsch. Each of these players demonstrates different sacrifice styles, from speculative attacks to positional exchange sacrifices, allowing students to experience the full spectrum of sacrificial chess.\nThis course is structured into over 220 detailed video lectures across more than 50 sections. Each section is thematically organized around a particular type of sacrifice or tactical idea, such as the Greek Gift, the Fishing Pole, sacrifices for removing key defenders, back-rank sacrifices, sacrifices for passed pawns, sacrifices based on pinning or unpinning, clearance tactics, and many more. By grouping the content in this way, we make it easier for students to absorb concepts and apply them in their own games.\nKey themes include:\nTactical sacrifices for checkmate\nPositional sacrifices for long-term compensation\nExchange sacrifices to gain control and limit opponent activity\nClassic attacking sacrifices in the opening and middlegame\nThe use of sacrifice in modern computer and AI-based chess\nPsychological and practical elements of sacrificing\nWhen not to sacrifice: understanding restraint and simplification\nYou will learn the difference between sound sacrifices and speculative ones. We present games where the sacrifice is perfectly justified and wins by force, as well as games where a speculative sacrifice introduces chaos, betting on the opponent's inability to find the right defense. Understanding this difference is essential to improving your chess decision-making.\nEach example includes in-depth commentary and analysis, breaking down not only the moves but the underlying strategic ideas and tactical motifs. This helps reinforce core chess principles such as piece coordination, central control, king safety, initiative, pawn structure, and dynamic imbalance.\nWe also explore how sacrifices relate to broader chess themes such as opening principles, middlegame plans, and endgame transitions. Many sacrifices are successful because of earlier strategic build-up. By studying these moments in full context, you will understand not only how to sacrifice, but also when to prepare and time them correctly.\nThe course also incorporates model games with a special focus on opening repertoires that naturally give rise to sacrificial opportunities. Openings such as the Italian Game, King’s Gambit, Vienna Game, Danish Gambit, Evans Gambit, and aggressive lines of the Sicilian Defense and French Defense are covered to show how opening choices can influence the likelihood of sacrifices arising in your games.\nSpecial attention is also given to:\nPositional Exchange Sacrifices (especially by Petrosian)\nSpeculative Intuitive Sacrifices (by Tal and Nezhmetdinov)\nStrategic AI-style Sacrifices (by AlphaZero)\nRomantic Era Brilliance (Anderssen, Morphy)\nHypermodern Positional Ideas (Nimzowitsch)\nAdditional sections include:\nSacrifices to punish opening principle violations\nSacrifices that leverage king-in-the-center positions\nThorn pawn sacrifices to restrict king movement\nSacrifices to control key files or diagonals\nCounter-sacrifices and defensive sacrifices\nSacrifices to gain tempi and destroy coordination\nThis course also provides a downloadable PGN library of all games covered, allowing students to study the examples independently. Students are encouraged to play through these games actively, pause at key moments, and guess the moves themselves to reinforce tactical pattern recognition.\nYou do not need any advanced chess knowledge to take this course. If you understand basic tactics like forks, pins, and discovered attacks, and are familiar with algebraic notation, you’ll be ready to absorb the content. The course is suitable for club players, adult improvers, ambitious beginners, and even advanced students looking to revisit key sacrificial themes in a well-organized format.\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\nRecognize opportunities for tactical and positional sacrifices\nCalculate sacrifice variations confidently\nApply sacrifice themes in blitz, rapid, and classical formats\nAvoid unsound sacrifices through proper evaluation\nIntegrate sacrifice strategy into your overall game planning\nPlay with more confidence, creativity, and attacking power\nWhether you're preparing for your next online chess tournament, training for over-the-board classical events, or simply looking to deepen your enjoyment of chess through artistic and powerful play, this course will give you the tools to approach every game with deeper insight and sharper vision.\nJoin thousands of students who have transformed their tactical and strategic understanding through structured chess instruction. Learn from legendary masters, train your mind to see deeper, and discover the beauty and impact of the chess sacrifice.\nThis is not just a course about giving up material. This is a complete journey through the art of sacrifice in chess — where calculation meets creativity, and where positional understanding meets tactical execution.\nEnroll now and unlock the full potential of your attacking and strategic play through \"The Complete Guide to Chess Sacrifices.\"",

The Reti and Romanishin Variations – How to Counter Uncommon Setups\nNge7 (Reti Setup) – A dubious defensive idea that allows White to seize the center.\nBe7 (Romanishin Variation) – Black delays piece activity, leading to positional problems.\nGrandmaster examples showing White’s dominant positions in these sidelines.\n5. The Jaenisch Gambit – Critical Lines and Counterplay\nThe Jaenisch Gambit (3...Nf6) is Black’s most aggressive response to the Ponziani, often leading to sharp tactical play. We break down:\nKey tactical ideas in the Jaenisch to avoid falling into counterplay.\nHow to exploit Black’s weak structure after exd4 and use early threats.\nWhy f5 setups can be punished with precise play in key variations.\n6.

Ponziani Countergambit (3...f5) – How to Refute Black’s Aggression\nThe Ponziani Countergambit (3...f5) is one of Black’s most aggressive tries, but White has strong refutations. You’ll learn:\nHow to respond with both d4! and exf5!, leading to dominant positions.\nWhy playing positionally with Bb5 can be effective against early aggression.\nHow Grandmasters have punished the Ponziani Countergambit in serious games.\n8. Additional Key Lines and Practical Examples\nTo reinforce learning, the course includes:\nReal-world games from Grandmasters and strong amateurs who have used the Ponziani successfully.\nCommon traps and tactics to watch out for when facing different responses.\nA breakdown of modern engine evaluations to see where White stands in today’s chess landscape.\nWhy This Course?\nUnlike many opening courses that focus solely on mainlines and engine perfection, this course is about practical success.

      "description": "This course is about Chess Traps! Sometimes there are moves that appear to be following good principles but which are bad for specific tactical reasons. You make ordinary developing moves, but then you find out that you are trapped and your opponent gets advantage. In this course I show a few traps that you should know not to be trapped!\nOf course, it's not possible to demonstrate all the possible opening mistakes here, but I tried to list the most popular ones. However, there are a number mistakes commonly made by beginners and novices in the opening stages of the game and I will show how to react to them.\nThis course consists of 15 lectures. In every lecture I cover a certain trap. Some traps are good and you can apply them during your games, other are bad and I demonstrate them for you only to learn how not to get trapped, if your opponent tries to outwit you.\n\nI designed this course for beginners and club players with FIDE rating from 1200 to 1700. But if you don’t have FIDE rating, this is not a problem and it shouldn’t stop you from taking this course. Learn them from this course!\nAfter finishing this course, you will learn some of the traps and may apply them during your games. I believe you will improve your performance!\nWith this course you also get:\nunlimited lifetime access at no extra costs\nall future additional lectures, game examples\nnever any questions asked full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\nSincerely,  Viktor",

Often, no-one has EVER taught them which game to play, how to play it, in order to get the best shot for their investment. Really, that's what your initial bankroll is, an investment, and this course will show you how to make the most of it, and not get taken for a sucker by the casinos.\n\nThe game of craps is a useful skill to have as well as a great metaphor for life. The dice roll for a time, and by having skill and knowledge of the game, knowing what bets are good vs. bad, knowing how to manage your money and taking advantage of Lady Luck when she shows, you can have a very fun time and pull something meaningful off the table, in this case, more chips (cash money) than you risked in the first place. The play is always balanced on a knife edge, just like life, and in that moment from the start of the roll to the end, we do our best to pull as much sweetness and meaning off the table that we can.\nThis course will teach you how to play and understand the underlying pattern of craps. And when a seven is rolled and the game ends, you leave willingly as you will likely, given the mastery of this material and applying it over time, leave with more money than you came with to the table.",

The Caro-Kann Defense is a popular chess opening for Black and enjoys the reputation of being one of the most solid responses to 1.e4.\nIt has also been a favorite opening of World Champions throughout history such as Capablanca, Botvinnik, Petrosian and Karpov, and has seen steady growth in popularity in recent years, played by modern Super-GMs such as Anand, Adams, and Leko.\nThe opening was named in honor of two strong players from Germany, Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann, who contributed many ideas to the development of this opening at the end of the 19th century.\nIn the modern chess world Caro-kann defence has given Black some great results at the very top in recent games. For example: Nakamura managed to beat Topalov with the Caro-Kann at the London Chess Classic in 2016.\nAnother thing that makes the Caro-Kann Defense so trendy today is that even though opening theory continuously develops and incredibly strong engines frequently find novelties and new approaches, there is still no easy, clear way for White to get an advantage against this opening in the most critical lines such as the Classical Variation, the Advance Variation or the Exchange Variation.",

Seulement, face à la difficulté du jeu, leur niveau finit rapidement par stagner, sans vraiment savoir pourquoi, tandis que les autres, eux, continuent de progresser. Alors ils se découragent puis pensent qu’après tout, ils ne sont peut-être pas fait pour ce jeu.\n\n\nNaturellement, sans être encadré, on arrive facilement à s’éparpiller avec toutes les ressources disponibles (livres, vidéos YouTube...) : résultats des courses, on se résigne à se contenter de notre niveau et on prend de moins en moins de plaisir lors de nos parties.\nPourtant tout n’est pas perdu, au contraire, avec la bonne méthode, TOUT LE MONDE peut progresser et améliorer son classement élo ! Et surtout reprendre énormément de plaisir et de satisfaction à jouer au échecs et gagner des parties !\n\n\nProgresser aux échecs, c’est comme dans tout les autres sports, il n’y a pas de secret, il s’agit de maîtriser les bases, puis améliorer ses compétences à l’aide d’un programme efficace, complet et structuré.\nC’est pourquoi après avoir publié cinq formations gratuites sur Udemy, je vous présente désormais une formation complète, efficace et pratique ! De plus, elle ne vous prendra que 10 à 15 minutes/jour, et vous pouvez y avoir accès à vie où que vous soyez !\n\n\n\"Gagnez aux échecs\", c’est 128 vidéos complètes de quelques minutes visant directement l’essentiel pour progresser, chaque vidéo étant accompagné de quelques Questions Réponses pour la mise en pratique !\nLes trois premières sections (1h, 35 vidéos) abordent les bases à absolument maîtriser pour passer au niveau supérieur, car je le répète il est primordial d’avoir des fondations solides pour travailler des notions plus avancées.\nLes quatre sections suivantes (4h, 93 vidéos) sont dédiées à vous faire passer au niveau supérieur : attaque sur le roi, tactique, stratégie... Ce sont ces notions qui vous ferons gagner une partie d’échecs, et qui avec de la pratique, vous ferons devenir un joueur redoutable contre ceux qui ne maîtrisent pas parfaitement ces points clés.\n\n\nConcrètement, en visualisant 3 à 4 vidéos de 4 mn maximum par jour, il vous suffira d’un mois pour passer du niveau débutant à celui d’un joueur avancé.\n\n\nC’est maintenant à vous de jouer, seriez-vous capable de trouver le bon coup ?",

      "description": "Por lo general, los cursos de ajedrez empiezan enseñando el movimiento de las piezas para, enseguida, colocarlas sobre el tablero y comenzar una partida. Cuando el principiante da sus primeros pasos, el desconcierto es abrumador: sabe cómo se mueven las piezas, pero no para qué. Creo que la culpa no es del estudiante, ni del ajedrez, sino del método empleado. Las reglas del ajedrez son sencillas si se explican bien y se trabajan de una en una. Pretender asimilarlo todo, sin dedicar el tiempo necesario a la práctica, resulta poco eficaz, por no decir frustrante.\nPresento un método revolucionario, con el que vas a comprender cada jugada antes de seguir avanzando. Una vez se conocen los movimientos de la torre y del rey, de inmediato atacamos los temas clave, como el jaque y el jaque mate, para así empezar a jugar con criterio. Trabajando con pocas piezas, será más fácil dominar las armas tácticas esenciales y aprenderemos a reconocer las buenas y las malas jugadas.

      "description": "La Estrategia es uno de los aspectos más importantes del Ajedrez. La verdadera diferencia entre un Gran Maestro y un jugador principiante es que el maestro sabe QUÉ necesita hacer y dónde tiene que colocar sus piezas para conseguir los objetivos adecuados a la posición.\nLa Estrategia tiene que ver con el arte de maniobrar, reagrupar y mejorar la posición de las propias piezas. Es decir, es el arte de coordinar las piezas, para conseguir un objetivo. Para ello, lo más importante es activar las propias piezas, al tiempo que se limita la actividad de las piezas del oponente.\nSaber cómo maniobrar con las propias piezas y encontrar buenas casillas, desde las cuales puedan coordinarse con el resto de las piezas, y desde las cuales puedan desarrollar toda su potencia es uno de los signos de la verdadera maestría.\n\nEn este curso aprenderás los secretos que se esconden detrás de cada jugada y aprenderás a maniobrar adecuadamente con tus propias piezas para mejorar paulatinamente su posición y ganar más partidas.\nAprenderás a pensar de manera estratégica y desarrollarás una visión a largo plazo que te permitirá crear buenos planes de juego.\nAprenderás la importancia de activar las piezas, al mismo tiempo que sabrás cómo limitar la actividad de las piezas del adversario.\nSerás capaz de construir estructuras de peones favorables, que te permitirán obtener la máxima movilidad para tus piezas, limitando al mismo tiempo la movilidad de las piezas del oponente.\nDominarás los cambios de piezas y sabrás cómo cambiar las piezas activas del adversario, para dejarle con piezas inútiles.\nDesarrollarás la capacidad para pensar de forma preventiva, lo que te permitirá anticiparte a las intenciones del rival, evitando el contrajuego del oponente.\nAprenderás las características de las piezas y sabrás cómo sacarle el máximo partido a cada una de ellas, con lo que podrás coordinarlas adecuadamente y mejorarás tu nivel de juego.\nEn definitiva, tienes ante ti un curso muy completo, con múltiples ejercicios prácticos y partidas magistrales completamente comentadas, así como test de preguntas al final de cada sección, que te permitirán comprobar si has asimilado bien los temas.\nSi de verdad estás pensando en mejorar tu juego, éste es tu curso.",

Witness Fischer's dynamic transformation in opening preferences, tactical depth, strategic mastery, and endgame techniques during these critical early years.\nExperience Fischer's gameplay through a lens of authenticity and precision. In an era where chess engines and opening theory were less advanced, players often relied on intuition and innovation, resulting in games rich in instructive moments. Remarkably, Fischer's accuracy, when tested against modern chess engines, reveals minimal errors—earning him the nickname of a 'computer' from many Soviet Chess Grandmasters, a testament to his flawless play and relentless determination.\nExplore Fischer's opening systems, from his initial embrace of the King's Indian Attack to his eventual preference for more theoretical approaches like the Sicilian Defence and the Caro-Kann. Learn how these systems challenged the Soviets' defensive strategies against him.\nDelving into Fischer's middlegame tactics and strategy unveils why he was often revered as 'computer-like.' Discover the subtle 'theoretical nuances' in his games, exposing his brilliant maneuvers that left even seasoned Grandmasters in awe.\nFischer's endgame techniques showcase his relentless pursuit of victory, often refusing draws and capitalizing on the slightest advantages to secure wins. His strategic play in Bishop vs. Knight endgames and seemingly drawish Rook and Pawn endgames offer invaluable insights into converting minimal advantages into victory.\nJoin us on this deep dive into the early career of a chess legend. Through a detailed study of Fischer's games, elevate your understanding of chess, drawing inspiration to enhance your own gameplay. Whether you're a beginner eager to learn or an advanced player looking to refine your tactics and strategies, this course offers unparalleled insights into the making of a chess genius.",

This course seeks to demystify this popular system, beloved by club players and World Champions for its ease of use, minimal requirement for theory memorisation, and potential to produce dynamic, attacking games.\nIn this course, we unpack the inherent 'independence' of the King's Indian Attack. You'll learn how to adjust your game and strategize against different move orders, with a specific focus on restricting the opponent's c8 bishop within their pawn chain.\nA highlight of the course is an exploration of the games of illustrious World Champions like Bobby Fischer, who applied the King's Indian Attack with spectacular results. Modern Grandmasters such as Bassem Amin, Tomasz Markowski, and Sergei Movsesian, as well as popular streamer Hikaru Nakamura, also utilize this system to bypass intricate opening preparations, simplifying the early phase of the game.\nNotably, the King's Indian Attack acts as a mirror image of the King's Indian Defense, but with an added tempo and a more flexible pawn centre. This course also emphasizes how the King's Indian Attack complements openings like the Reti, Catalan, English Opening, and Nimzo-Larsen Attack.\nThe Barcza System, a variation named after Gideon Barcza, will be introduced, showcasing the potential for greater 'independence' when applying the King's Indian Attack against black's pawn structure.\nThe King's Indian Attack can add depth to your chess repertoire, providing a pathway to aggressive and enjoyable games. Join this course to refine your chess strategies and boost your understanding of the King's Indian Attack.",

Tudo que você precisa é de menos de 1 hora por dia pelo menos 3 ou 4 dias por semana e pronto! Os vídeos são pequenos e rápidos para melhorar seu aprendizado.\nO Seven Card Stud é um jogo clássico de poker que pode levar uma vida inteira para aprimorar. No Seven Card Stud, os jogadores recebem sete cartas individualmente durante a mão, mas apenas a melhor mão possível com cinco cartas de cada jogador é utilizada para determinar o vencedor. Veja as Classificações de Mãos de Poker para o Seven Card Stud.\nDiferente do Texas Hold’em e Omaha, o Seven Card Stud é normalmente jogado com uma estrutura de apostas Limit, na qual as apostas são em incrementos fixos. Por exemplo, num jogo limit de $2/$4, as apostas são feitas em acréscimos de $2 nas primeiras duas rodadas de apostas, e incrementos de $4 nas três rodadas seguintes. O PokerStars não oferece jogos Stud Pot-Limit ou No-Limit no momento.\nUma variante do Seven Card Stud, chamada Seven Card Stud Hi/Lo (também conhecida por 'Stud Eight or better' ou 'Stud/8'), que também ensinamos aqui. Nesta variante de Stud, existem dois potenciais vencedores em cada mão, uma pessoa por ter a melhor mão em high e outra pessoa por ter a melhor mão em low, desde que as cartas para low estejam abaixo do 8 ou melhor.\nOutra variante é o Razz. Nesta variante de Stud, o pote inteiro é concedido para a menor mão low, sem qualificação.",

Comprenderlo te permitirá dejar de mover piezas por inercia y comenzar a tomar decisiones fundamentadas, como lo hace un Gran Maestro. En este curso aprenderás no solo a reconocer posiciones, sino a entender qué planes aplicar en cada momento y por qué.\nEl programa está dividido en 4 módulos progresivos, diseñados para llevarte paso a paso hacia una comprensión profunda:\nMódulo 1: Fundamentos del ajedrez posicional\nAprenderás a identificar las estructuras de peones más comunes (cadena, aislados, doblados, mayorías), sus ventajas y debilidades, y cómo construir planes efectivos a partir de ellas. También comprenderás los principios básicos de la coordinación de piezas y cómo evaluar posiciones más allá del cálculo inmediato.\nMódulo 2: Estrategias en las aperturas y planes típicos\nVeremos cómo crear planes sólidos en diferentes tipos de aperturas y qué hacer cuando sales del libro. Aprenderás patrones estratégicos en sistemas abiertos, semiabiertos y cerrados, además de cómo anticipar los planes del rival.\nMódulo 3: Factores dinámicos y estáticos\nNos adentraremos en el juego con alfiles de distinto color, el valor de las casillas débiles, cómo crear y explotar puntos de ruptura, y cuándo priorizar el ataque sobre la defensa. Entenderás cómo usar la actividad de las piezas para generar ventajas a largo plazo.\nMódulo 4: Del medio juego al final\nTe enseñaré a gestionar la transición entre fases de la partida, cómo simplificar manteniendo ventaja y cómo reconocer cuándo cambiar piezas o mantener tensión. Aprenderás conceptos claves para entrar a finales favorables y cómo manejar posiciones técnicas con seguridad.\nAdemás de la teoría, trabajaremos con ejemplos prácticos extraídos de partidas de Grandes Maestros y posiciones comentadas, para que no solo memorices ideas, sino que aprendas a aplicarlas en tus propias partidas.\nAl finalizar el curso:\nSabrás crear planes estratégicos sólidos en cualquier tipo de posición.\nTendrás la capacidad de evaluar posiciones con criterio, entendiendo fortalezas y debilidades.\nMejorarás tu visión a largo plazo, anticipando las ideas del rival.\nDesarrollarás una comprensión profunda de posiciones abiertas, cerradas y semiabiertas.\nEste curso no es solo teoría: es una guía práctica para pensar como un jugador fuerte, tomar mejores decisiones y, sobre todo, disfrutar más del ajedrez. Si quieres dejar de sentir que juegas “a la defensiva” y empezar a controlar el ritmo y la dirección de tus partidas, este curso es para ti.",

That same year, my teammates and I also won the Iranian Premier League. Like most competitive chess players, I participated in and won many individual tournaments. Although I haven’t competed in official tournaments for several years, at the time of creating this course my online play placed me among the top 1% of players worldwide, according to a Lichess profile I created specifically for this course.\nHaving devoted much of my youth to chess and later trained in computational sciences, I now see an opportunity to combine my scientific perspective with my understanding of chess. That’s why I created this Introduction to Chess course: designed specifically for beginners, it provides a clear, solid foundation while showing the game through a computational and scientific lens. No prior chess knowledge is required—just an openness to an academic-style approach and attention to detail.\nThe course is divided into two parts:\nPart 1 (S1–S5) covers the essential chess rules and notation in just over one hour.\nPart 2 (S6–end) focuses on improving gameplay and developing strategic thinking in under two hours.",

Don't want to spend hours learning how to play blackjack? Don't want to read a typical 280-page blackjack book? If so, this course is for you. This course will quickly and easily teach you how to play blackjack. With a bit of practice, you'll be able to confidently walk into any casino within a week of finishing this course.\n\n\nMy Qualifications\nI've been playing semi-professional blackjack for 15 years. I first sat down at a blackjack table in 2002 and played for fun for a few years. In 2006, I read the book \"Bringing Down the House\" and was hooked on blackjack. I learned how to count cards in 2 months. Since then, I've taken tens of thousands of dollars out of Las Vegas casinos. I've played so much blackjack, I couldn't forget how to play even if I wanted to. Over the years, my family and friends have always asked me to teach them the basics of blackjack.\nThis course is the beginner's information I've taught my friends and family for 20 years.\n\n\nHere's What's Included...\nHow to Play Blackjack in a Casino is a complete beginner's guide that teaches you everything you need to know about blackjack. This course walks you through the important concepts in blackjack with demonstrations.\nFor Your Small Investment, You Get Full Lifetime Access to...\n\n\nSection 2: The Goal of Blackjack\nIn this section, you will learn the two ways the player (you) win in blackjack. Sure, you may have an idea of what the goal is in blackjack, but the real goal is a bit counter-intuitive.\n\n\nSection 3: What You Will See on a Blackjack Table.\nWhile not as complicated as a Craps table, when you first sit down at a blackjack table, there's a lot you need to know. In this section, I explain the following:\nWhat's written on the table. Understand what the dealer must do, how much insurance pays, how much blackjacks pay.\nThe items that are sitting on the table. Explanations of the shoe, the rack, and the discard tray.\n\n\nSection 4: The Rules of the Game\nBlackjack rules are relatively straightforward, but there are a few quirks that you must know. In this section, you'll learn them.\nThe value of each card. The unique aspect of face cards and Aces.\nHow your hand wins in blackjack.\n\n\nSection 5: The Process of Play in Blackjack\nIn section 5, you'll learn the order of play in blackjack. For example, you'll learn from where the dealer starts dealing the cards, how the dealer resolves the hands, and how the dealer pays all blackjacks first.\n\n\nSection 6: Introduction to Basic Strategy\nThis is the most important concept in blackjack and in this course.\nYou'll learn the perfect mathematical way to play every hand in blackjack. Knowing this, and playing the perfect way is how blackjack is the fairest game in the casino. You'll learn:\n\n\nBasic Strategy\nThe hand gestures for receiving cards, staying on your hand, splitting, and doubling down.\nExactly how to use the Basic Strategy Card with demonstrations\nInstructions on how to use the best online blackjack trainer on the internet. This is a simple, and powerful computer trainer that I've personally used since 2007.\n\n\nSection 7: How You are Paid When You Win\nHere, you will learn how much you should get from the dealer when you win. Yes, the dealer and the pit boss will normally pay you correctly, but you must know yourself.\n\n\nWho This Course is NOT For:\nExperienced blackjack players who already understand perfect basic strategy.\nExperienced blackjack player with a desire to learn how to count cards.\n\n\n\n\nGuarantees\nNo Blackjack Experience Needed Guaranteed: You don't need to know anything about blackjack because my training walks you through, step-by-step from beginning to end.\nFree 100% Money Back Guarantee.

Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas, também conhecido como MTA:SA, é um dos melhores multiplayers para GTA San Andreas, está bem a frente de seu maior concorrente, com servidores mais completos e modos de jogo mais elaborados. Resumindo: Multi Theft Auto (MTA) é um pequeno programa que permite ao usuário jogar o GTA San Andreas em rede com seus amigos.\nMas você sabe o que é GTA? Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas é um jogo eletrônico de ação-aventura desenvolvido pela Rockstar North e publicado pela Rockstar Games. É o quinto título principal da série Grand Theft Auto e foi lançado em outubro de 2004 para PlayStation 2 e em junho de 2005 para Xbox e Microsoft Windows. Versões para plataformas móveis foram lançadas inicialmente em 2013, enquanto que uma versão aprimorada, sob o subtítulo The Definitive Edition, foi lançada em 2021. O jogo se passa no estado ficcional de San Andreas, com a história seguindo Carl \"CJ\" Johnson em sua luta para lidar com guerras de gangues, confrontos com policiais e as relações com sua família e amigos. O mundo aberto permite que os jogadores naveguem livremente pelas áreas rurais e urbanas de San Andreas.\nA jogabilidade é mostrada em uma perspectiva de terceira pessoa e o mundo pode ser atravessado a pé ou com veículos. Os jogadores controlam Carl Johnson, com muitas missões envolvendo tiro e direção. Ao contrário de seus antecessores, San Andreas introduz elementos de jogabilidade que foram incorporados em jogos posteriores, incluindo elementos de RPG, opções de personalização de roupas e veículos, e uma vasta gama de atividades e minijogos. Seu enredo foi baseado em vários eventos reais que ocorreram em Los Angeles, incluindo a rivalidade entre as gangues de rua Bloods e Crips, a epidemia do tráfico de crack, o Escândalo Rampart do Departamento de Polícia de Los Angeles e também os distúrbios de Los Angeles em 1992. A equipe de desenvolvimento realizou grandes pesquisas com o objetivo de reproduzir as diferentes cidades dentro do jogo.",

      "description": "Ian Nepomniachtchi is one of the strongest chess players in the world and a candidate for the world chess crown. FM Viktor Neustroev will help you improve your chess skills by analyzing the most illustrative games of GM Nepomniachtchi.\nChess is a versatile game. To be a good player is not enough just to know the openings and endgames. It is necessary to develop your thinking, and this can be learned only by analyzing the games of chess masters.\nThe course \"Play Chess Like Nepo\" is a comprehensive work on chess. I designed this course for any chess player who wants to improve all aspects of his chess games and, of course, for fans of GM Ian Nepomniachtchi. By the end of the course, you will be able to attack and defend better, calculate deeper, find more tactical and strategic options and understand how to play the endgames!\n\n\n7 sections to improve your chess skills:\n\n\nOpening Disaster\nA quick win may be a result of a blunder, but usually, it happens when one of the players chooses and prepares a complex and sharp opening and his opponent doesn't know how to react to these moves. It's not obligatory to choose the best moves in the opening you prepared, you just have to choose the most principled moves that are hard to refute when playing over the board. If you play like that your opponent will be under the pressure. Even top players make mistakes. This is the way Ian Nepomniachtchi does in his games and it often works!\n\n\nAttack\nIan often initiated a breakthrough with his pawns on the enemy king, even it doesn’t reflect the logic of the position and by the first glance, the game could continue in a positional way. But finally, he was absolutely right starting such an attack. This is his special ability to understand the position properly. And this is what you guys may learn from the course.\n\n\nTactical Vision\nMany legendary chess players, especially world champions have tried to give an exact definition of the combination. But the general signs of the combination - complex tactics, check, captures, attacks, exchanges - are all present in the games of Nepomniachtchi. To win in a tactical battle, you need to develop a combination vision, solve problems, study sharp openings, analyze the games of famous masters of tactics. And Ian Nepomniachtchi is one of them.\nCalculation\nWhen 2 top grandmasters play a game and start calculating the lines, the player who can calculate deeper and evaluate the position properly by the end of the line has some advantage. Usually, all top GMs can calculate the line deep enough, that’s why the second factor – the ability to evaluate the position properly becomes decisive. And this is where Ian Nepomniachtchi gets some edge and demonstrates how to find hidden perspectives of the position to get a clear understanding of how to continue when the line ends.\n\n\nStrategic Play\nStrategic play involves improving the position of your pieces, the king, maintaining a balanced pawn structure, removing weaknesses in your camp, and hindering the opponent for the same purposes. Strategic play is often combined with tactics as a way of solving positional problems. However, I want you to understand when it’s time to look for tactical solutions and when you’d better play positionally. There are many excellent examples of a strategic play in the games of Ian Nepomniachtchi.\n\n\nDefense\nWhen playing complicated positions, there is often a need to defend the king. For example, when you have extra material, but your opponent keeps the initiative, and let's say initiate a kingside attack. In such a case you have to come with a plan and decide how exactly to defend your position.\nI realized that many club players are unable to defend their position properly. Some of them just ignore the attack and others go to the passive defense. That’s why before we start the analysis of Ian Nepomniatchi's games, let me share some insights about possible plans if you are under attack. The art of Defense is an important topic that is almost uncovered in chess books & videos on the Internet.\n\n\nEndgame Technique\nWhen teaching my students, I faced that many of them don't understand the principles of playing endgames and that's why they choose wrong directions for their future actions. For example, they start a kingside attack instead of attacking weaknesses or activation of their pieces.\nA proper plan, coordination of all pieces, king centralization and creation of weaknesses into the enemy camp. This is what is required when you play the endgame.\nPure technique and positional manoeuvres are the art that a grandmaster must master, especially at the top level. And Ian Nepomniatchi successfully demonstrates it in his games.\n\n\nIn each section I illustrate the games that Ian Nepomniachtchi played, explain the logic behind his moves and emphasize the moments where you can learn something to become a stronger chess player.",

      "description": "Welcome to \"The Complete Guide to Chess Opening Principles\" – a comprehensive and deeply instructive chess course designed to elevate your understanding of how to play principled, strategic, and purposeful chess from the very first move. This course is especially curated for beginner to intermediate players (roughly 0–1600 rating range) who wish to move beyond rote memorization and into a mindset of clear, structured thinking based on core strategic concepts.\nWhy Opening Principles Matter\nOpening principles are the foundational rules and heuristics that guide how chess should be played in the initial phase of the game. They serve as a map to navigate the infinite jungle of opening variations and unfamiliar positions. However, principles are not rigid formulas – they are flexible tools meant to help you make sense of the board and make good decisions even when you forget theory or face novel setups. The goal of this course is to teach you why certain opening ideas work, rather than what to play move-by-move.\nWe explore three core principles that are the backbone of strong opening play:\nKing Safety – prioritizing the protection of your monarch through early castling and sound pawn structures.\nCentral Control – occupying or controlling the e4, d4, e5, and d5 squares to enable space, mobility, and coordination.\nPurposeful Development – bringing out your pieces quickly to active squares, with your king’s safety and central control in mind.\nThis course is designed to bring those principles alive not just through explanation, but through deep dives into more than 140 model games, many featuring Paul Morphy and José Raúl Capablanca, two legends who exemplified principled chess.\nWhat You Will Learn\nBy the end of this course, you will have gained the ability to:\nDevelop your pieces quickly and purposefully while coordinating with your broader strategic goals.\nUnderstand how to prioritize King safety and how early castling or missed opportunities for castling can decide games.\nAchieve and maintain central control through classical and hypermodern strategies.\nAvoid common beginner mistakes such as moving the same piece repeatedly or bringing your queen out too early.\nMake principled decisions in unfamiliar positions using your understanding rather than relying on memory.\nCarry King safety and central control as persisting priorities into the middlegame.\nAnalyze and learn from classical master games, elevating your pattern recognition and strategic intuition.\nMake calculated tradeoffs for King safety – including sacrifices or positional decisions.\nThe Power of Master Games\nInstead of loading this course with dense opening theory or memorized variations, we present a rich tapestry of classical and modern model games that allow you to see these principles in action. From Paul Morphy’s iconic Opera Game to Rubinstein’s Immortal, to Botvinnik’s subtle defensive resources and Capablanca’s smooth centralization, you will learn how great players shaped the board with King safety and central control in mind.\nThese games are not just instructive – they are joyful. They light up the board with clarity, elegance, and purpose. Rather than memorizing 20 moves of a Ruy Lopez or Queen’s Gambit line, you’ll learn why the first 5–6 moves matter, what they aim to accomplish, and how to pivot when your opponent goes off-script.\nThis approach is more effective for most players under 1600 than theory-heavy courses, and far more enjoyable.\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into 24 sections and over 140 lectures, each categorized by the theme it exemplifies:\nSection 1: Introduction and Mindset\nCovers the value of principles, why King safety is prioritized, how strategic intent guides moves, and why master games can be more relevant than opening memorization.\nSection 2: Core Principle – King Safety\nThe largest section, featuring over 50 annotated games showing how delayed castling, risky pawn grabs, or underestimating King vulnerability lead to disaster. From Morphy to Capablanca and beyond.\nSection 3: Core Principle – Central Control\nThis section showcases games where controlling or losing the center impacted the course of the game. We compare classical occupation with hypermodern ideas, and explore how the center shapes the battlefield.\nSection 4: Core Principle – Purposeful Development\nGoes beyond “develop quickly” and explores how to develop with intention, focusing on coordination, King safety, and central control. Includes Rubinstein’s Immortal and more.\nSections 5–10: Development Support Ideas\nThese sections highlight supporting principles such as:\nAvoid unnecessary pawn moves that don’t help development or King safety\nDon’t move the same piece twice unless needed\nConnect your rooks\nDon’t bring your Queen out too early\nDon’t leave pieces unprotected\nEach concept is reinforced with multiple game examples so the ideas “stick.”\nSections 11–12: Smart Ideas\nGoes deeper into ideas like holding onto a Bishop without counterpart and avoiding early pawn weaknesses.\nSections 13–21: Practical Advice\nReal-world chess is messy. These sections help you:\nRecognize and apply standard pawn structure plans (like the Carlsbad)\nChoose openings that fit your style\nAvoid memorization without understanding\nAvoid trusting theory blindly\nAvoid “bad traps” that violate principles\nBe cautious when castling into attacks\nCarry King safety and central control into the middlegame\nYou’ll learn that many positions lost in the middlegame could have been prevented by better opening choices.\nCore Philosophies\nThe course is built on several guiding beliefs:\nChess understanding beats memorization – This course prioritizes pattern recognition and principle-based thinking.\nKing safety is not optional – It is the main theme that drives development, pawn structure, and centralization.\nDevelopment has a purpose – It must serve King safety and central control.\nThe center is the battlefield – Control it, and you control the game.\nModel games are gold – Every game teaches something – even masterful losses like those of Botvinnik or Anand.\nWho Is This Course For?\nThis course is perfect for:\nBeginners and club players (0–1600 Elo) seeking to improve their opening understanding\nChess learners frustrated with trying to memorize openings\nPlayers who want to improve their strategic decision-making in the opening phase\nFans of classic games who want to study them with a practical learning purpose\nCoaches and teachers looking for clear thematic material to share with students\nWhat You Need Before Starting\nThere are no special tools or software required – just a love for chess and a desire to improve. Some basic knowledge of how pieces move is assumed, but even a beginner can benefit by starting here.\nWhy This Course Is Different\nMost opening courses teach variations. This course teaches principles backed by vivid examples. You’ll come away with:\nA mental framework to approach any opening\nClear habits for development and safety\nConfidence to face unfamiliar positions\nA deep appreciation of classical games\nA practical toolkit for real-world games, not just theoretical ones\nFinal Word\nChess mastery begins with mastery of the opening principles. Not in the sense of theory memorization – but in internalizing the why behind good moves. With this course, you’ll develop a principled approach that carries into your middlegame and endgame, built on clarity, safety, and strategic foresight.\nJoin us now to study over 20 hours of carefully crafted video instruction, spanning over 140 annotated lectures and model games.\nLet’s build your foundation in chess the right way – principled, purposeful, and powerful.",

You will find many chess challenges, practical games of famous grandmasters and my games with classical time control and theory.\nIt is very important that I tried to show how to play the London system primarily for White, but I also presented several games for Black. The most important thing for me was to show as many different plans and directions of the game as possible, to explain the problems and strong moves. I hope I succeeded.\nIt's important that you can download specific line trees with my comments in the \"link to theory\" section, where you will find specific moves tested not only by practice but also by Stockfish 13. So you don't need to anylyse yourself, I did this work for you, everything you need is undestanding and memorise.\nAlso I believe that every course must have some practice. During the videos I can ask you to find a best move for example. Also I prepared some test puzzles for checking your knowledge, you will find it in the end of the course.\nLondon system is good opening for learning as first opening but also top Grandmastes like Carlsen , Kramnik, Kamsky plays it regularly.\nWhy you should start to learn London System:\nSolid opening (hard to make a misstake by white)\nGood in blitz, rapid\nGood against very strong playes (to make a draw)\nFor Lazy players, once learning - possible play forever, your opponent can't avoid this opening.\nHave one opening more and increase your pool of ideas, plans\nIf you are feeling you are strategy player\nWhy should not play.\nLine is very popular, a lot of well prepared opponents\nIf you have to play only for win (some draw tendency)\nIf you are feeling you are tactic player\nHow I tryed to solve these problems?\nI will show you a lot of novelties and ideas.\nI can't change, chess has draw tendency now almost everywhere :)) So if you play blitz or rapid, there are more misstakes and resault games.\nI focused on strongest moves, but I was constantly showing aggressive alternatives\nI hope I told you all pros and cons of the London System - so I hope this information help you to solve, is it opening for you or not. During the coures I explain these things in detail.",

OBS é a abreviação de Open Broadcaster Software (software de transmissão aberto), e este nome já diz muito sobre sua principal característica.\nTrata-se de um programa gratuito e de código aberto. Isso significa que é possível codificar e transmitir vídeos com personalizações e configurações específicas para cada caso.\nOperacionalmente, podemos dizer que o OBS Studio funciona captando as imagens de uma webcam ou tela de computador e transmitindo o conteúdo captado por meio da plataforma de streaming.\n\n\nAlém de configurar uma transmissão ao vivo, quem sabe como usar OBS Studio pode ir além na apresentação de conteúdos. Isso porque a plataforma possibilita o acréscimo de cenas e fontes (origem do conteúdo) durante a transmissão, além da personalização do material com logotipo.\nÉ interessante destacar que, embora seja bastante intuitivo, o OBS Studio oferece inúmeras configurações de cena, como efeitos de entrada, saída, de som, animações etc. Para explorar todas as opções disponíveis, pode ser necessário assistir a um tutorial ou buscar orientações em fóruns de discussão oficiais da ferramenta.",

In addition, you will learn more ways to respond to common 1.e4 openings such as aggressive openings like the King's Gambit, Evan's Gambit, and the all important Sicilian Defense. We will also go into more detail regarding how to play the many classical Spanish Opening variations.\nIn addition, you will learn more ways to respond to the French Defense as white so that you don't fall for the many tricks embedded in this strong opening for the black player.\nMore Chess Openings for the Modern Player will help you to become a stronger chess player, and win more games by giving you a strong understanding of the very critical area of chess strategy that is the opening phase of the game.",

      "description": "Every time when you'll play with a black perspective it would be a little bit difficult because usually White side will chose the opening and you need to know how to react to it in a correct way. And this course will help you to build solid Repertoire for Black against everything White may play.\n\n\nEvery Opening from White covered. That's right - this is a lifetime repertoire covers every possible try from White in 6 hours video and you have the chance to train with PGN files which included inside the course.\n\n\nSo what's inside the course?\n\n\nYou’ll learn to fight 1.d4 and even 1.c4 and 1. Nf3 variations. Against 1.d4, your main weapon will be the Grunfeld defence well known for its tactical variations and of course, for one of the thoughest opening White to crack. This tried-and-true opening will stand up to master level play - and even offer a few nasty surprises to your opponents.\n\n\nAgainst 1.e4, another opening with full of calculation stands for Sicilian. Well, the reason Sicilian you don't need to do much memorization as other openings and in most cases all you need would be to setup the simple structure. In the Anti-Sicilian variations Black often times plays with e6 structure which helps to cut off some theory and go straight to middlegames with good advantages.\n\n\nSince this course full Repertoire for Black, of course our journey will stop at these openings. You'll also learn how to:\n\n\n- Break up the London setup by playing with a sharp ...c5 pawn break\n- Crush 1.b3 with double fianchetto setup\n- Bust the Bird (1.f4) with amusingly annoying moves that will wreck White’s kingside\nand more!",

With the exception of early-game Junglers, no position is as important or impactful upon a League of Legends game as that of the Mid Laner. The role has always had the potential to solo carry a match, and some of the most skilled professional players, including Faker, have called the Middle Lane their home. While it can often be seen as daunting to newer players, as your mistakes rarely go unpunished, playing mid-lane helps a player to improve like no other role can. This guide will explain the variety of available champions, how to improve your laning phase, successfully build structures, and the fundamentals of playing to carry as a Mid Laner.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course:\nWhat to do before you queue up for midlane\nHow to dominate the game\nObjective values\nHow to Roam\nHow to Split push\n\n\nGame Mechanics\nCreep Score (CS)\nWave Management\nRoaming\nTeam Fights\nTime Management\nApply Pressure\nVision Control\n\n\n30-Day Money-Back Guarantee: If you don't like the course, you can ask for your money back in 30 days.

      "description": "Welcome to \"The Complete Guide to Chess Calculation,\" a comprehensive journey that takes you deep into the heart of calculation, one of the most critical skills in chess. Whether you're a beginner aspiring to elevate your game or an advanced player aiming to refine your skills, this course offers something invaluable for everyone.\nSection 1: Introduction and Building a Strong Foundation\nIn the opening section, we explore the vital role calculation plays in chess, starting from its general importance to its specific function in securing positions and avoiding pitfalls, especially when overconfidence creeps into play. We'll delve into the nuances of critical positions, where precise calculation isn't just helpful—it's mandatory.\nNext, we lay the groundwork for advanced proficiency with a trilogy of lectures on foundational calculation skills: mastering visualization, tactical and checkmate patterns, and evaluation techniques. Understanding the limitations of human calculation compared to computers is essential, and strategies to mitigate these limitations are thoroughly discussed.\nThe course then transitions into principles that guide effective calculation: checking all checks, captures, and major threats. Here, we introduce the Spice Framework, a unique method for prioritizing \"spicy\" forcing moves, which includes various \"Spices\" such as Weakness of the Last Move, Killer Common Square, and more.\nRewarding calculations are the heart of this course, and several lectures are dedicated to understanding how to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of your calculation process. From time management and blunder awareness to refuting opponent's plans and knowing when to halt calculations, these lectures are goldmines of practical knowledge.\nOther Sections: Practical Application through Puzzles\nAfter the rich, theoretical groundwork, the course propels you into practical application with a diverse array of puzzles, starting from level #1. These puzzles, sourced from real games, range from classic scenarios to complex positions faced by Grandmasters. Each puzzle is an opportunity to apply learned concepts, sharpening your calculation skills in a practical context.\nAs the puzzles progress in difficulty, you'll be challenged to integrate more advanced concepts, reinforcing not just your calculation skills but also your overall chess strategy. Through this rigorous practice, you'll learn to recognize patterns, anticipate challenges, and navigate even the most demanding of chess scenarios.\nJoin us on this immersive journey, and transform the way you harness the power of the multi-purpose tool of calculation, and ultimately, triumph in the enthralling world of chess.",

It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are octahedral in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Mèffert also produces a similar puzzle called the Tetraminx, which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a truncated tetrahedron.\nIn this course you'll learn how to solve the PYRAMINX through the beginner's method.

My name is Mateusz and I've played over 3 million hands of No-Limit Texas Hold'em and lots of hands from different poker variants like PLO.\n\n\nI started playing poker by depositing $13 into an online poker room, which I lost within like 5 minutes of playing, but then I read a little bit about the basics, deposited another $13, and never had to invest any more money into poker again.\n\n\nI created this course because I remember vividly when I was starting playing poker, there were no good educational materials for beginner players.\n\n\nSure, there were some pretty good books, but none of them started at a 0 experience level. All of them were for people who already knew the game and had some experience.\n\n\nI had to learn everything by trial and error and I wanted to create a poker course that would reduce this costly and painful learning phase for a completely new player to be as smooth and easy as possible.\n\n\nI mean, why lose time and money learning poker in an ineffective way if you can go through a course and learn it optimally?\n\n\nThis course is tailor-made for someone who has little or no experience with PLO and wants to learn the fundamentals, the most basic principles that allow you to win money when playing with casual (no strategy, just fun) players.\n\n\nThe lessons are quick and well prepared so they will teach you those basic concepts really well and if you combine that with practice, you will become a player that can crush recreational players with ease in no time.\n\n\nYou will learn:\nHow Omaha is played\nHow to calculate the max pot bet\nHow to have an excellent hand selection\nWhat positions there are and how positions affect the play\nWhat are the most common player types and how to adjust to them\nWhat are the most common spots in PLO and how to play them\nHow to play post-flop\nThe Short Stack strategy\nThe Big Stack strategy\nWhen and how to bet\nHow to get better at the game\n\n\nAs a bonus and in case you haven’t played any variant of poker before I am also including 4 bonus videos which will teach you:\n- The hand rankings so what beats what, how we compare hands, what are kickers, etc.\n- What is Expected Value (EV) and why it’s a super important aspect of poker, other games, and also life\n- What are Pot Odds, how to calculate them, and why they’re very useful to make better decisions\n- How to set-up Poker Tracker 4, which is a poker tracking software that helps you track your progress, analyze your hands, and see real-time stats on the other players when playing online\n\n\nI’m also including a .pdf with the hand rankings and glossary of poker terms to help you understand the poker lingo.",

      "description": "Many of the world chess champions excelled at positional play and often hardly lost including Jose Raul Capablanca and Tigran Petrosian. Petrosian was an inspiration to Anatoly Karpov who made comments in a key Gibraltar interview that he essentially used Petrosian's style but to win and not be content as much with drawing. The more modern world champions such as Vladimir Kramnik and Magnus Carlsen also excel at positional play.\nThis course looks at the foundations set out by the first official World chess champion Wilhelm Steinitz and consolidated by Emanual Lasker and shows how the positional world champions took the concept of accumulating advantages and managing counterplay to new levels.\nThis course provides important positional patterns for making slight improvements to your position and accumulating small advantages. Doing these things whilst also making sure control is kept of the position through minimizing the opponent's counterplay can lead to very one-way controlled games.\nA positional chess pattern architecture\nThe course does not wish to be overly prescriptive as this may result in concepts being the driver of one's own games instead of one's own thinking about the unique challenges and resources one faces. Instead of \"principles\", the course makes use of \"Patterns\". The \"patterns\" are structured in this course into:\nControl Patterns - making sure control is not lost in the position and therefore it becomes much harder to build any sort of advantage. Control patterns including simplification and minimizing counterplay.\nImbalance Patterns - how differences in the position can be a great way to both liven up games but also provide key winning opportunities with positional play focused on one's own favorable imbalances\nStructure Patterns - Philidor has indicated \"Pawns are the soul of Chess\" and it seems the positional players really aim for pawn structures in general that are healthy and have great prospects for supporting the pieces and great positional plans\nWaiting Patterns - how the opportunities to win can often be amplified if only the opponent is given the opportunity to weaken their position further or crack under the positional pressure\nEndgame Patterns - showing how the Endgame has its own particular positional themes\nOverwhelming Patterns - showing how positional pressure can be made to overwhelm opponents\nPiece Quality Patterns - showing how small improvements to piece position can really be important\nCenter Patterns - showing the importance of the center and the hypermodern view of control vs occupation.\nWeapon Patterns - including passed pawns, thorn pawns, bishop without a counterpart\nKing-safety patterns - Checkmate still ends the game even for positional players\nActivity patterns - making sure one's pieces are active\nCrowning patterns - standard ways of making use of positional advantages\n\n\nGame examples\nFull game examples are taking for the positional great players such as Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Petrosian, Karpov, and modern super grandmasters such as Michael Adams. Games are analysed in great detail using the very best modern engine technology with Neural network capabilities which make their analysis more positional grounded than in the past.",

      "description": "You have limited time to devote to chess study, and most of that goes to reviewing your openings to move 25, with all their sidelines. Sound familiar? Here’s a solution: surprise your opponent in the first four moves with The Elshad System!\n\n\nIn a groundbreaking survey of this emerging counterattack, 3 Time Greater Philadelphia Chess Champion proposes a shocking approach to the closed openings featuring an early …h7-h6 and …g7-g5. Black’s king typically remains in the center, while the white monarch is subjected to a withering kingside offensive. Best of all, the “safe harbor” of general opening principles to meet your unconventional strategy is possibly the worst way for White to respond. Even grandmasters can fall victim to the Elshad, especially in blitz and rapid chess.\n\n\nFaced with the novel challenges of The Elshad System, your opponent will have to rely on his own resources instead of cranking out deep theory. Avoid those symmetrical drawing variations from unambitious opponents playing White. Play the Elshad and experience once again what it’s like to play fresh, fighting chess!\nMaurice Bishop uses the creator of the Elshad System (Elshad Mamedov) ideas and techniques and add a little twist to the opening. With these techniques learned from Elshad Mamedov and the author of the book “The Elshad System” FM Igor Nemtsev you will see fast how many opponents fall victim to the Elshad System chess opening.",

As League of Legends players, we have all experienced the struggles that come with an unbalanced team, especially in the absence of a solid support player. In this course you will discover that the role of support is more than just warding for your team and assisting your ADC in lane. Support heroes are the backbone of breakout team fights and often determine the outcome based on their ability to play the role properly, so mastering the skills associated with support heroes will be a core focus of this course.\nIf you are considering picking up a new champion to play with, Karma would be a good stable choice in these fast-paced meta changing days. In 2018, League of Legends has rolled out patches that have been a complete game changer; you might find one week you are on a winning spree and the next week you are losing in bunches. Karma’s offensive and defensive abilities make her versatile and adaptable. Her shield and speedup ability make her one of the most resistant champions, whether it's against aggressive or poke champions. Not to mention, her shield and speedup works on all your allies if you combo it with Mantra (R), giving her the ability to help your team engage and disengage. Her Mantra (R) and Q ability make her one of the best at poking out your enemy in lane or team fights.\nYour instructor, Lohpally, is a challenger tier Support player and partnered streamer on Twitch. Lohpally has been playing League of Legends since the game was released in 2009 and has been in Challenger tier every season following the launch of the game. Lohpally’s professional career includes playing for teams such as: Curse, Complexity, and Winterfox. Currently, Lohpally focuses on educational streams on Twitch and coaching. He has experience coaching players from a variety of levels ranging from players who are new to the game to players on top LCS teams such as Cloud 9 & Fnatic.\nIn this course, you learn the basic combos of Karma and the 3 important aspects to playing Karma well:\nLaning Phase\nMatchup vs Defensive, Aggressive,     & Poke Champions\nTrading Effectively\nApply Pressure\nTeam Fights\nPositioning\nApplying Pressure\nPeeling for Your Team\nTaking Advantage of Mistakes\nVision Control\nEarly Game Vision Best Practices\nMid-Late Game Vision Best Practices\nAvoiding Ganks\nPlease enjoy Lohpally’s Karma course and hopefully you can level up your game!",

Ich werde daher ein Reihe praktischer Übungen mitgeben sowie Links auf Lernstudien bei der Online-Schachplattform lichess. Dort kann man nicht nur Schach spielen, sondern auch Partien analysieren, selbst Stellungen aufbauen und mit anderen diskutieren, z.B. mit mir ;-)\nDieser Kurs ist mein erster Videokurs bei Udemy, ich hoffe, dass er euch gefällt und ihr ordentlich Spaß beim Lernen habt.

      "description": "Welcome to \"The Complete Guide to Winning Chess with Simple Openings\"\nAre you ready to revolutionize your chess game by mastering simple yet powerful opening strategies? This course is your ultimate guide to achieving success without relying on complex and memorization-heavy opening theories. With a focus on practicality, intuition, and timeless principles, you’ll learn how to confidently navigate the opening phase and build a strong foundation for the middlegame and endgame.\nWhy Simple Openings?\nChess is often perceived as a game where intricate opening preparation reigns supreme. However, the history of chess reveals countless examples of players who achieved greatness using simple openings that emphasize principles over theory. This course demonstrates how accessible openings can be just as effective as complex systems.\nWe take inspiration from Mir Sultan Khan, one of the most extraordinary players in chess history. Despite having little formal training or access to advanced opening theory, Sultan Khan achieved remarkable victories against some of the greatest players of his era, including José Raúl Capablanca and Savielly Tartakower. His games highlight how clear strategic ideas and strong fundamentals can outperform overly theoretical play.\nWhat Are Simple Openings?\nSimple openings are those that prioritize:\nDevelopment: Getting your pieces into active positions quickly.\nKing Safety: Ensuring a secure position through timely castling.\nCentral Control: Occupying or influencing the central squares.\nThese openings are easy to learn, intuitive to play, and provide a reliable path to success. Key systems and variations covered in this course include:\nColle System: A straightforward and solid system that transitions seamlessly into the middlegame.\nQueen’s Pawn Opening: Flexible options such as the Pseudo-Catalan and Krause Variations.\nIndian Game: Including the Knights Variation, ideal for a safe yet dynamic start.\nSemi-Slav Defense: With examples like the Stoltz Variation.\nQueen’s Gambit Declined: A classic choice for solid positional play.\nCenter Game: Direct and aggressive opening for control of the center.\nQueen’s Indian Defense: Combining flexibility and subtle pawn moves.\nSicilian Defense: Featuring the Scheveningen Variation for sharp counterattacks.\nCaro-Kann Defense: Played in the Exchange Variation, balancing defense and counterplay.\nRuy Lopez (as Black): Steinitz Defense and Steinitz Deferred systems for a strong, safe setup.\nThese openings are not only simple to remember but also versatile, offering solutions for both beginners and intermediate players.\nLearn From the Games of Legends\nThe course’s subtitle, \"Mir Sultan Khan's Amazing Games Show How Simple Openings Still Won Many Tournaments,\" highlights the instructive nature of this journey. Sultan Khan’s triumphs are a testament to the power of simplicity in chess. By analyzing his games, we’ll uncover:\nHow to neutralize dangerous gambits and counterattacks.\nTechniques for exploiting weaknesses such as backward pawns and misplaced pieces.\nStrategies for punishing poor king safety and underdevelopment.\nIn addition to Sultan Khan, this course also explores games from other masters who excelled with simple openings, including José Capablanca, Tigran Petrosian, and Vladimir Kramnik.\nCourse Highlights\nThis comprehensive guide features over 24 hours of video content organized into 61 sections and 120 lectures, covering every aspect of winning chess with simple openings:\nOpening Mastery Made Easy\nLearn how to transition smoothly from the opening to the middlegame with confidence.\nDevelop a repertoire of practical, easy-to-learn openings tailored to your style.\nUnderstand the principles of opening play, including development, king safety, and central control.\nStrategic and Tactical Insights\nAnalyze games featuring critical concepts such as semi-open files, pawn structure imbalances, and positional sacrifices.\nMaster key tactics like pawn breaks, piece exchanges, and kingside attacks.\nExplore themes like minority attacks, thorn pawns, and good knight vs. bad bishop endgames.\nTimeless Lessons from Classic Games\nDiscover how Sultan Khan neutralized aggressive openings and turned positional edges into victories.\nStudy iconic clashes against strong opponents, including Milner-Barry, Savielly Tartakower, and Vera Menchik.\nLearn how simple strategies led to decisive wins even against complex systems like the King’s Indian Defense.\nPractical Tools for Improvement\nRecognize and exploit key weaknesses in your opponent’s position.\nUse simplifying combinations to convert advantages into winning endgames.\nApply concepts like fianchetto bishop amplification, outpost creation, and central pawn breaks to dominate the board.\nWhy This Course is Perfect for You\nThis course is ideal for:\nBeginners seeking an approachable introduction to chess openings.\nIntermediate players looking to refine their opening repertoire without overwhelming complexity.\nChess enthusiasts who enjoy learning through classic games and timeless principles.\nCompetitors aiming to improve their opening play and build a strong foundation for the rest of the game.\nKey Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nDevelop a solid, adaptable opening repertoire based on simple yet effective systems.\nUnderstand the transition from opening principles to strategic middlegame planning.\nEnhance your tactical awareness through real-game examples.\nGain confidence in handling diverse opening setups, from d4 systems to e4 counterattacks.\nImprove your overall chess understanding through the study of legendary games.\nJoin Today\nWith 24 hours of in-depth content, this course is your gateway to mastering simple yet powerful chess openings.

Como por arte de magia tus oponentes acaban con tus ideas.\nEn este curso intentaremos desmenuzar cada uno de los elementos de la posición, para así ganar una mejor comprensión de lo que sucede en los momentos críticos de las partidas en las que nos encontremos. Suele suceder que en lugar de enfocarnos en entender cada uno de los elementos de la posición, tratamos de procesar toda la información de un solo golpe, lo que puede hacer nuestra tarea bastante difícil. Ya conocemos el viejo adagio que estipula que es necesario aprender a caminar antes de correr. Este curso se trata precisamente de eso.\nTras venir jugando al ajedrez por los últimos 15 años, he destilado todas las lecciones que si alguien me hubiese explicado cuando tenía un nivel de 1400-1700, me hubiesen ahorrado bastantes quebraderos de cabeza y confusiones.\nEl ajedrez es más divertido cuando se gana.\n¿Qué estás esperando? ¡Mejora tu ajedrez! ¡Únete al curso ahora!",

I will show you how to use basic scanning and cross-hatching methods to solve easy to medium level puzzles, moving on to more challenging puzzles using the “candidates” or “pencil mark” method.\nEach lecture focuses on a particular solving technique along with examples. Download and print the example puzzles and follow along as I show you how to use your new-found skills to solve a puzzle from start to finish. Then practice your skills using the downloadable practice puzzles in each section.\nAfter learning some basic and advanced solving techniques we will take a look at some variations of the game, from 3D Sudoku that can be solved using basic techniques to Killer Sudoku which actually requires some basic arithmetic skills.\nWhether you have never played Sudoku before or are a regular player looking for new techniques this course is for you!",

Dust it off, I'll show you how to solve it.\nI learned to solve the cube when I was 8, though my sister decided not to teach me the very last step and I had to figure that out myself. Since then, I taught a dozen of my friends how to solve the Rubik's cube with the very same method, and we challenge each other to see who's the quickest. My best time is 1 minute 23 seconds. Are you up to the challenge, too?\nI'm not good at 3D modelling or high-tech video editing, but I learned to create good quality videos and added what I lacked from Rubik's cube tutorials: just a few easy steps that would be understandable even for an 8-year old and a bit of personal touch. So let me sit down next to you and show you how to solve the cube with my 6 super-easy steps. You'll see the videos as if the cube was in your hand, I'll point out the shortcuts, and mistakes, and well... I'll help you practice as long as you master the Rubik's cube!\nI also added some extra content about how to choose the proper cube if you don't have one, do fun patterns once the cube is solved, do some basic maintenance (please-please, do not remove the stickers, ever), and what to do if you're facing a cube with nothing but mirror-like sides...\nSo are you up to my challenge?",

The puzzle goes as follows: Can you put three white pawns on different files and, of course, two kings, so that it is still a draw with white to move?\nThink about that! You have three extra passed pawns (no doubled or tripled pawns), it is your move, and yet this is still a draw!\n\n\nLearn and Master Pawn Endgames (Two Pawns | Part 1) with a Successful Grandmaster\n\n\nLearn how to win with two extra pawns\nStudy how to draw against two pawns, if possible\nUse the principles of opposition and distant opposition when losing your last pawn.\nAnticipate your opponent's actions to win the game\nUse mined squares, key squares, and shouldering to crack your opponent's defense\nLearn the brilliant solution to the puzzle mentioned before\nDiscover how to think in terms of chess geometry (which is different from the one we are used to)\n\n\nThis course will enhance your understanding of the fascinating world of chess endgames.\n\n\nThe course consists of 5 sections.\nSection 1 | Introduction: You will learn what this course is all about. There you will also find my position on the russian war against Ukraine.\nSection 2 | Two extra pawns: You will learn how to win with two extra pawns and discover the situations when you can still hold a draw. Also, you will find out the solution to the three-pawn puzzle (Spoiler Alert!).\nSection 3 | Pawns on adjacent files: You will discover how to survive when you lose the pawn. Also, you will find out how to consider your opponent's plan when winning the pawn. Sometimes, you will have to resist playing obvious moves.\nSection 4 | Pawns on the same file: Mined squares, key squares, opposition, when your intuition may fail you, chess geometry vs Euclidean geometry, counterintuitive decisions, difficult shouldering. All of this is waiting for you in this section.\nSection 5 | Short Conclusion: You will hear the course summary.

      "description": "FORWORD\nIf you were with me on the 20th of January 2009, just before noon, we would be standing at the arrival of Kennedy Airport on my way to Nashville to meet an important man in the gambling world.\nThis man gave his entire life to researching the odds in one's favour in a casino, notably the game of Baccarat and Roulette.\nI had come to know of his work by chance or should I rather say by divine intervention. The reason for saying the latter, is because as soon as I met him at the airport our hearts connected in a divine way and we became soul brothers since then.\nYou see, for the then past decade (before our meeting) I had got acquainted with the game of roulette and had never heard about baccarat. Like many other people before me, I too was hooked on the game of roulette and had been seeking for ways to beat the game so that I could finally make a passive income from it.\nHowever, again I am sure like many of you this would become a struggle between the game itself, let alone the casino authorities who were there for one purpose and one purpose alone - to drain you of all your money (bank-roll) once you stepped inside their premises.\nIt finally took one brave, intelligent and dedicated man to break the code of the casino games and share with us his secrets to receiving a slight edge above the ‘bosses’ of the world of big money and give us our share of their money for our day-to-day living.\nI spent a week with Donny and learnt as much as I could from him. Moreover, as part of my learning with him, I would get the chance to play alongside him a privilege not every person/client gets to do... and believe me what a privilege that is... I repeated this feat of magic in 2018 when I sat alongside him in Singapore with a client of his and witness them win Singapore 108,000+ dollars in a few hours.\nOf course you would like to know of my achievements and for that I will say... After coming back home and playing at the local casino in my\ncountry, one night I won SR45,000 (4,500 dollars) and was asked to leave by the manager. Since then I was told I can win only a limited amount of 500 dollars if I want to play but then I would need to stop!\nI did not go back again. Today I play my games internationally when I travel to places like Mauritius, Srilanka, Kenya and Singapore. There they even have the game of baccarat which is even better for me.\nSo maybe you are like I was before, looking for a system in baccarat or roulette that can win. We all know that there isn't a system on this planet that can make you win 100% of the time. But if there is a system that can give you the edge over the casino, then you would like to know... right?\nTo this effect, then you have picked up the right book. Never has there been a system that decodes the chops and streaks in both the roulette and baccarat. Here though we will be looking more into the one for breaking the baccarat patterns in a way that will make you smile more often at the baccarat table rather than clenching your fists in anger because your every move on the table is a losing one.\nYou will not believe when with your own eyes you see how the system beats the streaks whilst targeting only the chops in a shoe and likewise vice versa when you decide to target only the streaks in a shoe. The system bypass the chops leaving them to the side of the table so to speak... not treading on them, not crashing upon them but rather floating above the cards and looking down on them with awe :)\nWith this system once understood, you can coach a partner to play alongside you... meaning that when you target the chops, he targets the streaks in a shoe. But then why share your profits with someone else when you can have your cake and eat it too, by targeting both the chops and the streaks at the same time.\nWant to know how? Follow the system in the next following chapters as I decode live recorded casino results to see how this all works out best. Good luck with your venture and may you grow your wealth day-by-day with ease and joy whereby you truly live the “Lazy Man’s Way To Riches!”\nDr. Henry Naiken.Msc.D",

By the end of the course you will truly understand why chess tactics appeared in the position, what were the signs that triggered the combination, what exact steps does it take to find most chess combinations. Spoiler alert: I am going to take away a little bit of mystery out of chess and replace it with some logic!\n\n\nLearn and Master Chess Tactics with Successful Grandmaster\n· Find chess combinations efficiently\n· Recognize the signs that trigger tactics\n· Learn typical tactical patterns\n· Build up your understanding of chess\n\n\nThis course will get your calculation abilities to the next level\n\n\nThe course is for Beginner to Intermediate chess players. I also put several examples that would be interesting even for grandmasters but I explained them in the fashion that anyone with a basic understanding of how chess pieces move could get it. In the final section, I am going to show an opening combination that many grandmasters do not know (including yours truly until the year 2014).\nAfter you finish the course, you will be able to understand most chess combinations that you will see on a much deeper level.\n\n\nThe course is broken into 5 sections.\nSection 1: I explain what are 4 main questions to ask during the game and how they help you find chess tactics\nSection 2: I use relatively simple puzzles to show how my method is working. You will learn additional helpful questions besides the four main ones.\nSection 3: I show how to use my method to crack much harder puzzles.\nSection 4: Covers the most important tactical motifs and the signs that trigger those motifs.\nSection 5: You will find GM games and one tricky opening tactic that many high-class GMs do not know! You will find a summary of the course at the end.\nEach section has downloadable pdf and pgn files with previously analyzed positions.\nWho this course is for:\n· Beginner/hobby chess players who want to become better at chess in general and in tactics specifically\n· Chess enthusiasts that want to take a glimpse into how grandmasters calculate variations",

In this Anti-London course we'll cover how to play against 2. Bf4 and 2. Nf3; 3. Bf4 lines. The variantions that you're going to learn will help you to get way more pleasant positions and of course better results too.\nLondon System fanatics play the opening, not because it leads to an objective advantage, but because they can play it on auto-pilot.

Essa última parte do curso é instrutiva para todos os níveis, mas tem uma profundidade de análise maior comparado com os outros capítulos do curso, então será mais adequada para jogadores de nível avançado.\nAlém dos vídeos, o aluno vai ter acesso ao material de apoio, onde analiso com mais detalhe e com mais profundidade as variantes mencionadas.

Tap into the experience of somebody who has worked with free-2-play for over 10 years.\nThis online Free-2-Play Game Monetization course is an exact copy of the Free-2-Play Game Monetization course that I teach at several universities as part of a broader game business curriculum. It is designed to give a broad and complete understanding of how the F2P can be deployed to monetize your game, regardless of whether you are a seasoned game designer, or a beginner.\nThe course consists of 11 lectures.\nIn the first lecture, we will start with defining what free-2-play really means, so that we all have the same understanding of the term before we get in deeper.\nA good way to explain free-2-play monetization is by showcasing its role in the user revenue funnel. We will visualize this role in relation to player acquisition and player retention.\nIn the next 8 lectures, we will spend significant time on the two main business objectives in free-2-play game monetization.\nLectures 2 through 5 will focus on the first objective, which is to get more players to pay.\nWe will present a pallet of ways in which you can increase the percentage of players that will pay in your game.\nLectures 6 through 9 will focus on the second objective, which is to have the players that pay purchase more.\nSimilar as with the first objective, we will provide a variety of methods to increase the so-called ARPPU, the average revenue per paying user.\nIn the tenth lecture, we will present several hybrid monetization models, which are a combination of free-2-play and one or more other monetization methods.\nAnd finally, in the last lecture of this course, we will discuss some of the criticism that the free-2-play game monetization model has received and we will present for methods to avoid the negative effects of free-2-play.\nI believe in practical education, so all lectures contain real-life examples.\nFYI: any and all proceeds of the sales of this course will go directly towards further development of Perfect Earth, so effectively you are helping me 'crowd fund' a game that teaches children about the impact of their actions on the environment.",

And you'll learn how to master each step and then we'll combine everything together.\n\n\n90% of my students below immortal do same mistakes, when we make assessment of their mechanical skills.\nAnd we always start 1st session fixing same mistakes. I've recorded this course to prepare future students for coaching session, so we can spend session time more effectively.\nStudents see significant measurable results after 5-7 days. We track progress with aim assessment routines, and flicking speed and first shot accuracy increasing by 15% in first week.\n\n\nFew cases:\n- Gold 1 to Plat 1 in 1 week after using methodics of the course\n- Gold 3: 100bots in 127 seconds => 107 seconds in 6 days\n- Diamond 3 to Immortal 2 - player that relied too much on his high IQ strats, after fixing his mechanics\n\n\nYou'll get framework for improving movement mechanics in Valorant.\n\n\nI've analysed hundreds of Valorant tutorials from best mechanics experts during these 2,5 years. All of them might bring you some results, but the thing that only few practice drills have best Result/Effort ratio. Students see first improvements after 1st session. It changes your mindset and you're starting to understand how to master raw movement mechanics",

Suitable for players at all levels, it offers a high reward-to-effort ratio, making it an ideal choice for learners. Even world champions and Grandmasters, including Magnus Carlsen and US Grandmaster Gata Kamsky, employ this opening across various time controls.\nIn this course, instructed by FIDE CM Kingscrusher, you'll delve into the nuances of the London System, mastering its key aspects and honing your understanding of this compelling opening.\nOur comprehensive approach involves examining successful applications of the system, with annotated games from Kamsky and Carlsen. We specifically focus on 2. Bf4 - the most modern treatment of the London System. This move maintains flexibility while countering early attacks from Black on the abandoned b2 square.\nThe utilization of \"systems\" in chess is not a new concept. Chess greats such as Bobby Fischer, Bent Larsen, and Julian Hodgson have favored specific systems to achieve success. The appeal of the London System lies in its simplicity: it lessens the burden of memorizing numerous sharp variations, allowing you to secure a comfortable position with ease.\nThis strategic simplicity gives you more room to refine other aspects of your chess prowess. By focusing less on complex opening theory, you can invest more time into tactics training and endgame learning. A balanced skill set in all areas of chess is what defines an effective player. Through this course, you'll work on eliminating weaknesses in your understanding and building a well-rounded game.\nBy mastering the London System, you can enhance your overall chess performance, leading to better results and a more enjoyable gaming experience.

      "description": "Hi! My name is Mateusz and I've played over 3 million hands of No-Limit Texas Hold'em which is the Cadillac of poker.\n\n\nI started playing poker by depositing $13 into an online poker room, which I lost within like 5 minutes of playing, but then I read a little bit about the basics, deposited another $13, and never had to invest any more money into poker again.\n\n\nI created this course because I remember vividly when I was starting playing poker, there were no good educational materials for beginner players. Sure, there were some pretty good books, but none of them started at a 0 experience level. All of them were for people who already knew the game and had some experience.\n\n\nI had to learn everything by trial and error and I wanted to create a poker course that would reduce this costly and painful learning phase for a completely new player to as smooth and easy as possible. I mean, why lose time and money learning poker in an ineffective way if you can go through a course and learn it optimally?\n\n\nThat is how From Zero to Poker Hero started and this Poker Course was created SPECIFICALLY for BEGINNER players.\n\n\nIt is tailor-made for someone who has little or no experience with poker and wants to learn the fundamentals, the most basic principles that allow you to win money when playing with casual (no strategy, just fun) players.\n\n\nMy idea was to condense my knowledge of these basic principles into 21 quick lessons which altogether take just under 140 minutes to watch so that it's easy to complete this course and learn to be a WINNING player.\n\n\nThe lessons are quick and well prepared so they will teach you the theory really well, but I believe that if you want to really master these fundamentals, you ABSOLUTELY positively have got to PRACTICE them.\n\n\nAs with all skills in life, you can't become a PRO unless you spend some hours practicing the craft. The way I designed this course is that after each and every lesson, you should spend at least 30 minutes actually PLAYING POKER, so that not only can you crystallize the knowledge you're getting from the lessons, but also at the same time you can get some actual experience of playing real money poker.\n\n\nSo if you only play the minimum 30 minutes after every lesson, it should take you about 13 hours to FINISH this course and I believe if you do it this way and put in the FOCUS and WORK, you will become a WINNING player in less than 2 weeks (if you do 2 lessons per day), so that's pretty good.\nObviously, you won't be able to beat pro players, but you will understand the game and know what's needed to get to that higher level (basically just practice on and off the tables) and you WILL be able to EASILY BEAT recreational players and most players you'll find on micro stakes tables online.\n\n\nSo, do you want to become a Poker Hero?\nGreat! Get the course now and start crushing :)\n\n\n11/19/2019 - Added 40 minutes of bonus material",

I have built myself over a 2 million credit inventory just from trading and also made about 4000$ selling Rocket League items. And I do think anyone can do the same with the right guidance and knowledge. I have also thought my friends basically the same lesson that is presented in this course and the results didn't surprise me.  They went from 5k credits inventory to 100k credits inventory in about 3-5 months. So my methods and information are proven to work.\nI made this course for people, that want to expand their inventory and even get some money out of Rocket  League.\nThis course is not just about my methods, which make me constant profit each month.

      "description": "Welcome to our course dedicated to the provocative Knights' Tango System, also known as the Black Knights' Tango, Mexican Defense, Two Knights' Tango, or Kevitz–Trajkovic Defense. This strategy can be deployed effectively against both 1.e4 and 1.d4, paving your path to victory.\nLearn from the legendary British Grandmaster Tony Miles, who leveraged this strategy to secure an impressive win rate of almost 60% over 95 games. This course also features a similar strategy for white pieces, known by various names including the Dunst Opening, Baltic Opening, Van Geet Opening, among others.\nInstructed by FIDE CM Kingscrusher, this course delivers in-depth understanding and practical application of an early Queen's Knight move. This creates a novel and exciting opening with black pieces, capable of disrupting standard opening theory and provoking irreversible weaknesses in the opponent's position.\nThis opening shares similarities with the Alekhine defense due to its pawn provocation nature. FIDE CM Tryfon Gavriel aka \"Kingscrusher\" has employed this strategy with remarkable success, especially in faster time controls prevalent in today's Chess scene.\nThe 'Tango' element of this system lies in the knight's provocative transition from c6 to e5/e7 to g6. This move often weakens the opponent's pawn structure, providing tactical advantages. An effective way to accentuate these weaknesses is to employ a dark square strategy, facilitating knockout blows to the opponent's king.\nDiscover how to handle a potential space disadvantage by trading off dark-squared bishops and exposing the burden of space that the Knight's tango imposes on the opponent. Explore the \"Mexican defence\" recommended by FIDE CM Kingscrusher, which has delivered promising results in master games.\nIn conclusion, if you seek a novel, exciting opening with a proven track record, the Knights' Tango system can be your secret weapon. Embark on this journey for a fun-filled, rewarding Chess experience!",

It's very important to at least have a system which contains some theory and a lot of PRACTICE. Recording this course I tried to solve this problem. This course contains everything you need for real progress. However, in this course, I just point you in the right direction and explain difficult moments. After that, I expect you to solve \"homework\". It must help you fully understand the information and your level is going to rise.\n\n\nThis course is good for beginners (0-1600 ELO), but don't worry if you have little experience because it helps you revise everything, get a system and practice. Of course, if you are 2000+ ELO rating player, this course might be too easy for you. I tried to use a detailed explanation, If anything was still too hard for you, I am waiting for your questions.\n\nI want to give you some recommendations:\nAfter watching the video, try to solve and figure out all homework. Yes, it's hard but super useful.\nTry to play chess since module 3. Time control for you is Rapid (15 mins or more). Playing blitz(5 and less) for beginners is just for fun.\nDon't waste your time. If something easy for you or I am speaking too slowly, make video speed 1.25x or even 1.5x :)))\nUse subtitles I added to this series. Inside them, I tried to fix most of the mistakes I made during the explanation.\nI hope you take advantage of this course. I did my best for you. Good luck, and see you at the chess tournaments!",

      "description": "This course will help you understand what to do in a one-pawn endgame.\n\n\nLearn and Master Chess Endgame (One Pawn Only for now) with a Successful Grandmaster\n\n\nLearn how to promote a pawn\nStudy how to properly stop the passed pawn\nUse your king to support the pawn promotion\nUnderstand the principle of opposition\nLearn about the distant opposition\nAutomate your knowledge and pass this knowledge to your muscle memory\nDiscover a funny position that the best chess engine of our time (Stockfish) does not understand\n\n\nThis course will lay the strong foundation for the fascinating world of chess endgames\n\n\nThe course is for beginner/club-level chess players.\nHere, you will learn, understand, internalize, and automate your knowledge and your reflexes in a one-pawn endgame.\n\"Why do I need to do that?\" one might ask. My answer would be as follows.\nLet us imagine that you have an extra pawn in an endgame. Imagine you and your opponent both have a queen, or a rook, or a bishop, or a knight. Both players have to know what is going to happen after the exchange. Most of the time, one of the sides is avoiding an exchange (usually, that is the weaker one). You need to know exactly whether you should exchange that last piece or not! How do you know that? Well, you evaluate the resulting one-pawn endgame! How do you do that? You study this course, and you understand it so deeply that it takes you several seconds to evaluate the final position. If you have to spend time analyzing one-pawn endgame at the end of every line, then you will simply run out of time!\n\n\nIt is quite possible that you already know all the information from this course. That is not enough! Let me draw a parallel with mathematics. It is not enough to just know how to multiply and divide natural numbers. In a chess game, like in a mathematical exam, you need to do it quickly so that you can solve more complex problems! In mathematics, the task could be figuring out whether the number is prime, or figuring out the greatest common denominator of two numbers. In chess, a more complex problem could be an endgame with more pawns than one, or an endgame with other pieces that could be exchanged by force. If you understand and know exactly the evaluation and the best play when there is one pawn on the board, then the more complex puzzles will be easier for you.\n\n\nThe course consists of 8 sections\nSection 1 | Introduction: You will learn what this course is all about. There you will also find my position on the russian war against Ukraine.\nSection 2 | Pawn against the King: You will find three short videos about the race between the pawn and the King trying to stop it. You will learn the rule of a square and how to use it properly.\nSection 3 | The King is shouldering another King: Both Kings are on the same side from the pawn. You will find examples of how your King can help your pawn by shouldering its counterpart.\nSection 4 | The King helps from the side: The Kings are on the opposite sides of the pawn. You will learn how to promote your pawn then.\nSection 5 | The Opponent's King is directly in front of the Pawn: You will learn how to stop the passed pawn with the King.\nSection 6 | Opposition: You will learn what an opposition is, what it means to win or to lose the opposition, and why. You will discover the ley squares for each passed pawn. You will learn what a distant opposition is. And you will learn the value of an extra pawn move in an endgame.\nSection 7 | Stopping the a-Pawn (and the h-Pawn): You will learn everything you need to know about stopping and promoting the a-Pawn (and, of course, the h-pawn via symmetry). You will also find out about a funny position that the most powerful chess engines of our time (like Stockfish) do not understand at all!\nSection 8 | Conclusion: You will hear the summary of the course and the importance of internalizing this knowledge and automating it. In the attachment, you will find a link to the free lichess study where you can check all the positions discussed in the course.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n- Beginner/hobby chess players who want to understand chess endgames better\n- Chess enthusiasts who are ready to build a foundation for their endgame play\n- Anyone who is interested in improving their endgame play\n- Chess players who want to evaluate one pawn endgame in a matter of seconds",

      "description": "The Benko Gambit is an aggressive and tactical reply to 1.d4. It will help you get an aggressive position, full of tactical possibilities. This is the best way to guarantee the victory!\nUsually the d4 - players would like to have a stable situation in the center and hopping for a maneuvre game. With Benko gambit you can destroy their plans and ideas; take them out of their comfort zone...\nBenko is not similar to other gambits with unclear compensation, but a positional robust opening system that survived thought centuries. The main idea of this system is to give up a pawn on queenside and then press White's weak pawns with rooks and powerful fianchetto g7 bishop. In many cases White lost the game by a tactical blow; something you can do in the future.\nWhy I created the lessons?\nBenko gambit is a base in order to understand more complex openings like Benoni and King's Indian Defense. It should be your first step before learning more advanced openings.\nIt has a lot of positional ideas that will help you improve your level to intermediate (more than 1500 ELO) or strong player (more than 1800 ELO). Black's pieces has very typical and characteristic positions. The maneuvers are standard and for that reason you'll remember them easily.\nIt is a system that helped me to get 1900 FIDE ELO rating and perform my best win against a 2300 ELO player; with black pieces! I know by hard all the ideas and lines because I use it for years. Thus, you can take advantage of my vast experience to create a powerful opening repertoire against 1.d4. You'll never fear this first move again.\nThe time to improve at chess is now; so please enroll to the lessons in order to boost your understanding and results to the maximum level!",

      "description": "La ruleta es el juego de azar más justo que existe, la casa nos paga casi lo mismo que nos tocaría por probabilidades matemáticas, pero tiene una ligera ventaja, un número en las ruletas europeas y dos números en las ruletas americanas. Otra ventaja que tiene es que una vez en el juego es complicado darse cuenta de cuantas tiradas seguidas se pueden fallar, hasta qué punto se puede alargar una buena racha o una mala racha, la ansiedad propia de jugar precipitadamente cuando uno va perdiendo o la fantasía de pensar que porque se haya ganado  una vez siempre va a ser así. Nuestras probabilidades de ganar aumentan mucho si nos apoyamos en progresiones matemáticas que hagan que con los mismos aciertos y errores el saldo sea mucho más positivo, pero cuidado porque también nos pueden llevar a la ruina.\nEn este curso haremos un repaso de las progresiones más conocidas de la ruleta, así como de algunos sistemas. Analizaremos los puntos fuertes y los puntos débiles de cada progresión para sacar conclusiones y poco a poco irnos dirigiendo a una metodología que nos permita encarar el juego de la manera más efectiva posible. Veremos como podemos  usar un método que nos permita tener un control del presupuesto, aprovechar las tendencias de aciertos para aumentar rápido las ganancias y lograr que las tendencias de fallos no nos hagan daño. Dentro de dicha metodología veremos varias variantes que podemos aplicar en función de si queremos optar a mayores ganancias arriesgando un poco más o si buscamos el mínimo riesgo posible, pero siempre optando a sacar mucho rédito a cualquier racha positiva que se nos presente y en ningún momento comprometiendo nuestro presupuesto para recuperar pérdidas anteriores. Dicha metodología está basada simplemente en progresiones matemáticas y en la distribución de los aciertos y errores.",

So in this course, I'll be teaching some of the most simple strategies of putting someone in checkmate and finding those hidden positions that can end with a checkmate. Even better, I'll be giving a link to my lesson practice where you can practice what is in this course and you don't need a membership for it.\nWhat you'll learn in this course is\n*Queen & King checkmate pattern\n*Two Rooks vs King checkmate pattern\n*How to look for checkmates\n*Simple checkmates in one\n*(coming soon) Checkmate in 2\n*(coming soon) Checkmate in 3\nOnce you've seen all of these videos, make sure to check out the link to practice these actual positions because practice makes perfect. It's actually good when first learning these positions to go over them a couple of times the first week and the same the following week. Finally, go over these positions once or twice the following month or two so you can build that long-term memory and will recognize these positions much faster.\nSo, what are you waiting for?

      "description": "Chess Armory's\nIntroduction to Chess\nThis course is designed to give you a thorough introduction to the game of Chess. Our first lesson, The Rules, is for new players and maybe a review if you're already familiar with the game. You can always skim through it or go to the quiz sections to test your knowledge.\n\n\nWhat is the best way to use this course?\nEach lesson builds on the instruction from the previous one. We recommend going through the lessons in order and taking all the quizzes. With Chess, it's important to practice what you learn in the course. We recommend setting up an account with lichess or chesscom so you can practice.\nIn addition to practicing online try to play \"over the board\" as well, it's a different feel when you play with your opponent across from you, and if you're interested in getting into a chess club or tournament, you should get accustomed to playing on real boards.\nEven though there are 5 hours of instruction in this course, it's not enough to dive deep into the different topics. Chess is a large subject, with a lot of material to cover, the goal of this course is to give you a solid foundation for getting started and playing solid games you can learn from.\n\n\nThe Lessons\nLesson 1 - The Rules\nIn this lesson we cover the basics of the game, how the pieces move, how to value pieces, and the different ways a game can end. If you are new to chess, definitely start here.\nLesson 2 - Basic Checkmates\nIn this lesson, we cover many checkmate patterns that are important to recognize in your games. This type of pattern recognition is invaluable to progress in chess.\nLesson 3 - Chess Tactics\nHere we introduce fundamental tactics that all serious chess players must know, including pins, forks, skewers, and more.\nLesson 4 - Opening Principles\nThe basic building blocks of a strong opening are explained with examples. This knowledge is critical for outmaneuvering your opponent in the opening game.\nLesson 5 - Two Openings\nTwo classic openings are taught in this lesson, the Ruy Lopez and the Queen's Gambit. We've chosen these stalwart openings to begin building your repertoire.\nLesson 6 - Strategy\nMake every move count, in this lesson, we cover the value of having a strategy and always playing with a goal in mind.\nLesson 7 - Calculation\nCalculation refers to a thinking process used by advanced players to quickly analyze and execute a move. It's a disciplined approach to mitigate missed opportunities.\nLesson 8 - Endgame\nWith only a few pieces left on the board, your King is thrown into action and every move counts. The endgame is less forgiving to blunders than the rest of the game.\nLesson 9 - Endgame Exercises\nLet's practice what we've learned. In this lesson, you were presented with different positions for you to analyze. Take your time and when you are ready listen to the explanation.\nLesson 10 - Analyzing Your Games\nTo seriously advance in chess requires study and the ability to analyze games. Going through your games allows you to see your strengths and weaknesses.",

I know it’s very hard to teach what plan to do, because positions are always different. There is no certain algorithm to make a successful plan. Everything depends on the position and concrete weaknesses of your opponent.\n\nEverything is shown by examples. We analyze the games played by famous grandmasters and I explain you their plans such as:\nHow to Fix Pawn Weaknesses in the Endgame\nSchematic Thinking\nAttacking in a Closed Position\nImproving the Position of the Worst Piece\nAttacking the Pawn Weakness and Weak Square\nCreation of 2 Weaknesses\nHow to Realize Advantage\nHow to Play an Equal Endgame\nHow to Play Symmetrical Positions\nHow to Use the Activeness of Your Pieces\nI designed this course for beginners and club players with FIDE rating from 1200 to 2000. But if you don’t have FIDE rating, this is not a problem and it shouldn’t stop you from taking this course. This course will also help you to improve your positional playing skills.\nAfter finishing this course, you will be able to apply these plans in your own games and I believe it will improve your performance!\nWith this course you also get:\nunlimited lifetime access at no extra costs\nall future additional lectures, game examples\nnever any questions asked full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\nSincerely,\nViktor",

      "description": "Do you like Adventure? Do you like \"secret gardens\" like the Novel \"Secret Garden\" - which we can use to spice up our chess and wake up from the over-trodden paths which can put us to sleep? Do you like Surprise? Are you sometimes a Maverick? Be a Top Gun in chess with 1. Nc3 :)\nSurprise is a powerful weapon in Chess. Kingscrusher has made great use of 1. Nc3 in online chess especially at faster time controls to get much better positions often than following standard opening theory. This course dissects the surprise value of 1. Nc3. It shows with greater informational preparation you can force the opponent to have to improvise more than you from early on in the game and win much more easily than playing in a more conventional manner. The suggestion was made by one of Kingscrusher's non-chess-playing friends once about playing a surprising opening move to bypass a master's preparation. This is that kind of move - leading often into unique relatively unexplored territories. There is often a choice to transpose back to standard territory or investigate the powers of the unique values and positions that 1. Nc3 can generate.\nEven modern top-flight Grandmasters are making use of Nc3-based systems to surprise opponents such as Baadur Jobava and Richard Rapport.  We can make use of transpositions sometimes to the relatively unexplored territory where these Grandmasters and others have cut through enormous amounts of opening theory to get Nc3-based positions where they have room to be creative and resourceful in original positions rather than the \"Beaten tracks\" of opening theory.\n\n\n1. Nc3 is known by many names - in fact, it has some of the biggest alternative name lists of any opening in existence.\n\n\nQueen's Knight Attack Opening\nQueen's Knight Opening\nDunst Opening\nHeinrichsen Opening\nBaltic Opening\nVan Geet Opening\nSleipnir Opening\nKotrč's Opening\nMeštrović Opening\nRomanian Opening\nMillard's Opening\nKnight on the Left, and (in German) der Linksspringer.\n\n\nKingscrusher has made great use of 1. Nc3 especially in faster time controls. 1. Nc3 tends to take opponents by surprise early on and encourages them to improvise badly away from their more theoretically prepared territory. 1. Nc3 can also be a great transpositional tool heading for some great attacking 1. Nc3-based destinations.\nKingscrusher's use of it often gets amazing attacking opportunities early on because opponents tend to want to chase the knight to g3 and in doing so create light square weaknesses. If Bc4 is allowed, then White often has amazing attacking potential making use of the h-pawn quite often later. But there is a more solid \"boring\" alternative in 1. Nc3 d5 2.d4 with a view to playing the Jobava London system - a name which GM Simon Williams has given to the particular variation of the London system where a Knight is placed on c3 instead of a pawn on c3.\nSome very strong correspondence chess players make use of 1. Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over the board as well. This course aims to establish an objective \"truth\" for this opening and its possible effectiveness at different time controls of bullet, blitz, standard one-day chess, and correspondence chess, which is the ultimate test of its \"Scalability\"",

      "description": "Are you ready to elevate your chess understanding with the most revolutionary ideas ever introduced to the game? “Chess Strategy, Openings, Tactics: Iconic Hypermodern Games” is a comprehensive and immersive course dedicated to the deep exploration of Hypermodern Chess—a powerful and flexible strategic framework that continues to dominate modern competitive play.\nWhether you're just discovering strategic chess concepts or seeking to enrich your knowledge of modern chess openings, this course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the Hypermodern school of chess, its origins, its philosophies, and its game-changing tactics.\nWhat is Hypermodern Chess?\nHypermodern chess is more than just a collection of openings—it's a complete strategic philosophy. It marked a radical shift away from classical chess principles that demanded early pawn occupation of the center. Instead, Hypermodernism advocates indirect central control, long-range piece activity, and the exploitation of overextension in your opponent's position. By inviting your opponent to occupy the center with pawns, you gain opportunities to undermine their structure, launch devastating counterattacks, and steer the game into dynamically rich positions.\nCore Hypermodern Openings Covered\nThis course explores every key Hypermodern opening system, including:\nRéti Opening – emphasizing flexibility, early knight development, and dynamic transpositions.\nNimzo-Indian Defence – one of the deepest and most respected openings against 1.d4.\nQueen’s Indian Defence – a solid system combining resilience and counterplay.\nGrünfeld Defence – a classic hypermodern response featuring sharp tactical possibilities.\nKing’s Indian Defence – a weapon of aggressive players that leads to rich, tactical middlegames.\nCatalan Opening – blending positional mastery with fianchetto bishop power.\nModern Defence and Pirc Defence – hypermodern systems provoking center control by the opponent and then striking back.\nAlekhine’s Defence – a provocative counter to 1.e4 that targets early pawn overreach.\nLarsen’s Opening (1.b3) – a creative and flexible system ideal for club and tournament play.\nThese openings are not just relics of the past. They remain highly relevant and are actively used in elite chess today. Champions like Magnus Carlsen, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Vladimir Kramnik, and Fabiano Caruana regularly employ these lines at the highest level of competition.\nA Complete Study of Hypermodern Strategy and Tactics\nThis course delivers more than 26 hours of rich instructional content—spread across 57 detailed sections and 131 high-impact lectures. Every minute is packed with chess insight. You’ll explore:\nStrategic Concepts: Prophylaxis, overprotection, control without occupation, and dynamic piece play.\nTactical Execution: How tactical motifs like discovered attacks, fianchetto pressure, and outpost exploitation emerge naturally from strategic play.\nPawn Structure Mastery: Understand and manipulate complex structures, including isolated pawns, hanging pawns, and doubled pawns.\nFianchetto Systems: Learn how to maximize the power of your bishops in long diagonal control and king safety.\nLearn from the Legends of Hypermodernism\nYou’ll study landmark games from the founders of Hypermodern theory:\nAron Nimzowitsch – creator of the overprotection principle and author of “My System.”\nRichard Réti – the originator of the Réti Opening and promoter of flexible development.\nGyula Breyer, Savielly Tartakower, and Ernst Grünfeld – each contributed essential ideas that reshaped strategic chess forever.\nYou’ll also see how modern Grandmasters continue to apply and evolve these principles in their own brilliant ways. Analyze dynamic Hypermodern ideas in the games of Ding Liren, Levon Aronian, Vishy Anand, and many others.\nKey Game Themes and Tactical Insights\nEach lecture dissects real master-level and Grandmaster-level games, highlighting:\nThe tactical use of fianchetto bishops to pressure central and kingside squares.\nHow to exploit premature central pawn advances by your opponent.\nThe power of knights on outposts and the seventh-rank rook.\nAdvanced ideas in the Reverse Nimzo-Indian, Double Fianchetto Systems, and Catalan transpositions.\nWith help from modern engines like Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero, you’ll gain a computer-verified understanding of what makes Hypermodern moves so effective.\nWho This Course is For\nThis course is ideal for:\nPlayers rated 0 to 2200 who want to deeply understand modern strategic chess.\nChess students who wish to expand their opening repertoire with rich, theory-light but concept-heavy systems.\nPlayers interested in tactical chess, particularly attacks arising from positional imbalance.\nFans of chess history who want to understand how strategic thought evolved in the 20th century and how it applies today.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nConfidently play and explain key Hypermodern chess openings.\nRecognize and execute Hypermodern tactics.\nMaster concepts like prophylaxis, overprotection, and strategic tension.\nUnderstand how to counter opponents’ classical strategies using modern ideas.\nAnalyze famous games by Nimzowitsch, Réti, and other icons with deep appreciation.\nEnroll Now\nIf you want to experience chess in its most flexible, dynamic, and elegant form, Hypermodernism is your path forward. With a thorough and enthusiastic presentation by FIDE Candidate Master Tryfon Gavriel (Kingscrusher), this course is your all-in-one guide to mastering Hypermodern chess strategy, tactics, and openings.\nJoin now and discover the timeless principles and dazzling attacks that have defined one of the most enduring revolutions in the history of chess.",

      "description": "Le poker est un jeu de hasard, qui n'a rien à voir avec la chance...ou alors juste un peu ! Le poker a énormément changé avec l'arrivée d'Internet. Il est devenu plus agressif et plus calculateur à la fois. Alors, comment bien jouer et gagner dans ce contexte ? Je vous propose de progresser depuis le joueur \"intuitif \" que vous êtes probablement déjà, vers un joueur plus \"calculateur\", puis de devenir un joueur \"d’instinct\", d’où le titre de mes livres et de mes vidéos: POKER INSTINCT. Le but de ce contenu, écrit directement en français, est justement de se démarquer de tous les livres et vidéos sur le poker: Alors que le hasard est bien présent, on s’apercevra rapidement qu’un bon joueur finira par gagner systématiquement sur le long terme en prenant les bonnes décisions. Bienvenue dans Poker Instinct. Bienvenue chez les joueurs gagnants: Ne laissez aucune chance au hasard !\nLa méthode Roshampok: Cette méthode est le fruit de ma compréhension de ce jeu de stratégie à la fois mathématique et humaine. Le poker est un jeu essentiellement basé sur des décisions à prendre avec une information incomplète, puisque l'on ne connaît pas les cartes des adversaires, ni celles qui vont apparaître au board, ensuite. On ne connaît pas non plus les décisions que les adversaires vont prendre par rapport à telle ou telle situation. Ce qui permet alors de prendre une bonne décision est d'intégrer un maximum de paramètres en un temps extrêmement rapide, comme un instinct. La méthode Roshampok provient du jeu \"pierre-feuille-ciseaux\" qui s'appelle le \"Roshambo\" aux USA, et \"pok\" comme \"poker\" bien entendu. On intègre 3 paramètres de base, qui reviennent à chaque main, que sont les cartes, les stacks et les positions. On y ajoute ensuite 3 paramètres dynamiques: les adversaires, le board et le meta game. La combinaison de ces 6 paramètres va vous permettre de prendre la meilleure décision dans une situation donnée. Bien entendu, il n'y a jamais de décision bonne à 100% à cause de la variance des probabilités du jeu. Mais en suivant votre instinct créé par cette méthode et par la pratique intensive du jeu vous arriverez à jouer aussi bien que le 1% des meilleurs joueurs et serez largement gagnants sur le long terme.\nLe dictionnaire Franglopok: Vous vous en êtes rendu compte, le poker moderne étant originaire des USA, la plupart des termes sont basés sur l'anglais. Ils permettent à l'instar des médecins ou des informaticiens, de discuter de manière précise avec un collègue du même domaine. Il est donc très important de connaître ces termes ou ces acronymes, comme C-bet, 3-bet, folder, UTG, New York Back Raise, etc. et de savoir à quoi ils correspondent. Chacun d'entre eux nous permettra de comprendre un aspect du jeu et de nous perfectionner. Pour cela, j'ai ajouté à la méthode un dictionnaire Français-Anglais-Poker, le \"Franglopok\" qui vous permettra de creuser chacun de ses termes et d'ajouter ainsi une connaissance à votre jeu, un peu comme une liste de vocabulaire vous permet de mieux comprendre et parler une langue.\nMon souhait est ainsi de devenir votre \"poisson pilote\" pour vous guider et vous faire triompher dans l'océan des fish du poker. J'espère aussi vous retrouver un jour online ou en live lors d'un tournoi: Nous nous reconnaîtrons facilement en tant qu'initiés du \"Roshampok\" et du \"Franglopok\" ! Je n'ai pas besoin de vous souhaiter gl (good luck), car maintenant vous n'allez laisser aucune chance au hasard !",

In order to fully benefit from this course you just need to know how the pieces move and some basic rules.\nI've been teaching chess for more than 15 years and mentored 3 junior players that became World Champions. I know exactly what material to teach you when you start learning about Endgames. Fundamental Principles such as Opposition, Zugzwang, Mined Squares are important to learn and master.\nIn this course I recorded 16 Lessons that will help you establish Fundamental Endgame ideas. Every chess player must learn Endgames. World Champion J. R. Capablanca once said: \"To improve at chess you should in the first instance study the endgame.\"\nAll lessons are very easy to follow and for your convenience I am adding a PGN file for all of the lessons that we will go over.  Thank you so much for your attention!

      "description": "La Defensa en Ajedrez es muy importante.\nEl ajedrez es un juego de ataque en el que gana aquel jugador cuyo ataque es más poderoso y termina dando jaque mate al rey enemigo.\nPor eso, en la partida de ajedrez es de vital importancia llevar la iniciativa y tratar de atacar poniendo constante presión sobre la posición del contrario.\nSin embargo, el hecho de que nuestro oponente lleve la iniciativa y tenga ventaja no quiere decir que tengamos necesariamente que perder la partida. Con una buena defensa se puede superar el mejor de los ataques y salir finalmente victorioso.\nGeneralmente, suele ser más fácil atacar que defenderse, pues si cometemos un error mientras estamos atacando solo significará la pérdida de la iniciativa pero nada más. Sin embargo, un error cometido en la defensa puede ser mortal y ser la causa de la derrota.\nUna buena técnica defensiva es uno de los signos distintivos de los maestros. Todos los grandes jugadores han sido auténticos maestros en la defensa, por eso es tan difícil ganarles una partida, ya que luchan y resisten hasta el final.\nEn este curso estudiaremos todos los recursos disponibles para el bando a la defensiva y aprenderás a defenderte como un Gran Maestro. Ya no perderás las partidas con tanta facilidad y sabrás cómo oponer verdadera resistencia hasta, finalmente, conseguir dar la vuelta a la partida y conquistar la victoria.\nSi realmente quieres mejorar tu juego, éste es tu curso.",

The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games using the film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.\nThe game is one of the best-selling of all time, with over fifty million sold across all platforms by June 2018. In addition, the Windows version holds a peak concurrent player count of over three million on Steam, which is an all-time high on the platform.\nDiscover:\nWinning game strategies\nBest practises for setting up your graphics\nGame setting you must follow\nWhy Game Awareness is crucial to your success\nPractice secrets\nTraining maps and how to get the most out of them\nWeapons 101\nBe an expert at the best weapons\nSolo action\nGroup actions\nStrategies for Early Game, Mid Game and End Game\nAnd much more...\nBattlegrounds received positive reviews from critics during both its early access period and on official release, who found that while the game still was not fully finished and had some technical flaws, Battlegrounds presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game received several Game of the Year nominations among other accolades, and is considered by Greene to be the defining game of the battle royale genre. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as it  becomes a popular eSport.",

Cela signifie qu'ils relancent plus souvent plutôt que de simplement suivre les mises initiales. L'objectif est de construire des pots plus importants et de forcer les adversaires à prendre des décisions difficiles.\nJeu postflop basé sur l'équité : Les joueurs modernes utilisent souvent des calculs d'équité pour prendre des décisions postflop. Ils évaluent les chances de compléter leur main ou de gagner le coup par rapport au coût de la mise. Cela leur permet de prendre des décisions mathématiquement solides et de maximiser leur espérance de gain à long terme. J'ai simplifié les calculs pour que vous puissiez les exécuter facilement pendant la partie en live ou online.\nL'exploitation des adversaires : Les joueurs modernes se concentrent sur l'observation de leurs adversaires et cherchent à exploiter leurs faiblesses. Ils cherchent des tendances de jeu, des schémas de mises récurrents ou des faiblesses spécifiques à exploiter. Par exemple, si un joueur est trop passif, ils peuvent le bluffer plus souvent.\nLa gestion agressive des tapis : Dans les tournois de poker, la gestion agressive des tapis est essentielle. Les joueurs modernes sont prêts à prendre des risques et à jouer pour une grande partie de leur tapis pour accumuler des jetons. Cela leur permet d'avoir une meilleure chance de gagner le tournoi, car ils peuvent mettre davantage de pression sur les adversaires.\nL'utilisation de la position : La position est un élément clé du poker moderne. Être en position tardive permet aux joueurs de prendre des décisions plus informées, car ils ont plus d'informations sur les actions de leurs adversaires. Les joueurs modernes profitent de leur position pour voler les blinds, bluffer plus souvent et prendre des décisions plus rentables.",

I am sure that you would get some ideas after watching this course. But most of the chess players do not know about this opening line at all.\nYou receive top quality videos of Grandmaster analysis.\nM Smirnov has developed lots of chess video lessons, articles, webinars and training courses, including the famous courses “The Grandmaster's Secrets\", “The Grandmaster's Positional Understanding\", and “Calculate Till Mate\".\nThe course contains not only my experience but also experiences from a lot of my friends: Grandmasters, trainers and other chess players, who helped me perfect the course! Many thanks to you guys! Now the course contains a lot of recommendations, which were taken only from SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE.\nEvery chess player wants to improve himself and make progress; however, one of the biggest problems is to understand how to do it.\nThe usual ways of training give very slow progress and even sometimes these are completely ineffective. Finding a GOOD chess coach is also a huge problem. During my chess career as a player and as a coach, I have thought about an effective way of learning all the time.",

I often don't know how to play further in unknown positions. In this case I normally try to recall typical positions with plans of which I am familiar with. Then I study the games of Grandmasters in these positions, and create a list of possible variations to play. Finally, I implement these plans in the rapid games. After 15 or 20 games, I know my strategy and play correctly.\nIn order to save you time of playing these 15-20 games and look for GM's games, I created this course. Here I have already analyzed the GM's games for you, and have outlined the approximate plans that you should use in different positions and stages of the game, including opened and closed positions, openings and endgames.\nThis method is already tested on my students. We study pawn structures and typical patterns in various positions, and their ability to find the right plans during the game improves significantly.  By choosing the right plan, they follow the pattern and understand better what to expect from the opponent. Of course, you also need to calculate the options, but it is much easier to calculate lines, when you know what will follow in the game.",

      "description": "A defesa siciliana é a segunda resposta mais popular das pretas contra o lance 1.e4 das brancas. Neste curso, mostro as reações mais típicas das brancas, incluindo erros frequentes e também as linhas mais críticas, caso você enfrente adversários muito bem preparados.\nVocê vai aprender como reagir contra as sicilianas fechadas ou 'anti-sicilianas' e também contra a siciliana aberta - minha sugestão é a variante dos 4 cavalos, que já busca uma iniciativa de imediato e faz com que as brancas joguem de maneira precisa para não ter problemas logo na abertura.\nUso como exemplo partidas da Internet para os níveis iniciante e intermediário nas linhas mais inofensivas por parte do branco e nos últimos capítulos o foco é em partidas presenciais entre Grandes Mestres, quando as brancas jogam de maneira mais precisa e buscando a vantagem. Essa última parte do curso é instrutiva para todos os níveis, mas tem uma profundidade de análise maior comparado com os outros capítulos do curso.\nAlém dos vídeos, o aluno vai ter acesso ao material de apoio, onde analiso com mais detalhe e com mais profundidade as variantes mencionadas. Assim como nos outros dois cursos, vamos ter o grupo no WhatsApp para os alunos tirarem dúvidas comigo e interagirem entre si.",

The course has the BEST SELLER BADGE and before the HIGHEST RATED BADGE\nIn this course you will not only learn how to solve any standard Rubik's cube ( from 2x2x2 to nxnxn ) but you will learn how to do it very fast using smart ways to avoid hard cases of the cube. My main goal is to let you know every thing about the Rubik's cube not only the basic method to solve it which take at least 40 seconds to solve it, but i'll teach you how to solve it under 20 seconds maybe under 15 also, it depends on your practice using  F2l ( advanced method )  which is the method champions use.\nAlso you will learn how to solve the 2x2x2 & the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube blindfolded without seeing it in very easy way using very easy remembering techniques.\nThere will be a section for every cube start from 2x2x to 7x7x7 and every section will contain a detailed explanation for solving the cube. After learning the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 Rubik's cube you will be able to solve any other standard Rubik' cube without knowing anything more, but to make sure you understand everything well i made a detailed explanation for the 6x6x6 & the 7x7x7\nYou will have any algorithm you are going to need in solving  any standard Rubik's cube either in a PDF in the start of the section of the cube or on the video itself. I am not using any software inn explanation, just the cube to make sure you see it very well and observe how i am solving it\nDon't worry about the duration of the course, that's because i made a detailed explanation for every cube and a walk through tutorial ( tutorial for me solving this cube ) for every cube which you can ignore",

      "description": "Welcome to this exclusive Tekken Online Course - Created by Tekken Player and Tekken Coach Rising Uppercut, combined with nearly two decades of experience!\nHi, thanks for stopping by, since you are here you are most likely looking for how to become a stronger player in Tekken 7 and I can assure you that you will be with these classes! If you still have doubts about your investment in this I suggest you continue to read on:)\n\n[2025 Update - As Tekken 8 is out this course has been discounted by 50% from its original price. What You will learn about Tekken 7 in this course you will be able to apply in Tekken 8 as well. Because much of what you learn here is the Base of how Tekken generally operates and how you should your psychology against the other player, etc. ]\n\nWhy you should get this Tekken course!\n\nAllow me to talk a little about why this came to be and why you should be a part of it! In recent years, I have been more committed to the coaching part of Tekken, and after having a bunch of students some of them often asked me for more, or in the matter of having materials or lessons to work with. I can't always handle too many sessions and students. So I decided to create a video series for the most common things.\nTo me this turned out to be much more than just a reference, so I decided to create a course instead. My students wanted content that is easy to repeat type of content after the session for them to practice. From that experience of being the player and the coach as well as being a student myself in my back in my Tekken 5 days. I took the combination of that and put it together into this course. As of now, this course has 30 video lectures spanning over 2 hours with Tekken 7.\nThe focus for you taking this course is to make sure no matter your starting point in this game the structure of the lessons will give a good all-around and step-by-step procedure of the game fundamentals and elements are put together. Through every lecture, you will attain a new skill and knowledge connected to the game and your character moves, etc.\nAs recommended, make sure you complete each step before heading over to the next one. Wanting to learn everything too fast is not a great way of learning anything, but move on as you understand the lesson. Applying what you just learned into the game is going to give the expected results over time, take into caution that Tekken is built upon you to repeat your actions over and over while applying that knowledge. This is just like a real martial arts train and repeats to become the best, now you have correct training at your fingertips knowing what to learn first before the other!\n\nThinking like a martial artist is why we enjoy Tekken, as it is you who gets better and stronger-minded, and not the character itself!\n\nWith some or no previous game experience, can anyone new develop the same skills as the skilled in Tekken 7?\nThis course is about improving your ability to perform well in the game and it's not graded by any entry-level. By adding new skills and visual information quickly and effectively to your muscle memory you will gradually understand the game mechanics and build the strength you'll need in the game. To most newcomers is about their character being better than them, but if you want to change that, this is about you getting better as the player with the character you play. You like anyone else here have the chance to get better, you might just be stuck and not sure where to pick up learning.\n\n\nHow this Tekken course will change your game and triple your process!\nIn today's world, Tekken is connected online and we don't play side-by-side on the couch much anymore. Thinking now, we all had that friend or knew that guy who was a little better than you in something particular of perhaps it was in Tekken! Perhaps you don't have that friend's friend who has won the latest Tekken championships to come over for a game night to teach you something new.\n\nWith all the time I spent learning on my own, I wish that I had come to have that friend of a friend in Tekken! Why because that precious time you can get with someone like that is remarkable. That's why investing in something that can grow you is something I personally do in areas of my life. Unfortunately, I did not have this tutor per se (even though I had players I could discuss various parts of Tekken with and take into learning from there as I did in Tekken 5, but from Tekken 2 to Tekken 5 I was pretty much on my own.\n\n\nHow is it different from anything else found in Tekken tutorials elsewhere?\nIt has taken me years to discover, experience, test, and finetune and have a fundament in the development of the games since Tekken 2. As of now being a 5-Star rated Tekken coach online, this is to become the best coursing in Tekken. The course goes beyond the videos you may find for free online and the free content is easily outdated and not arranged in proper order for you to learn it in the right way. Often when we watch a how-to Tekken video on YouTube there is either too much other stuff that just gets you confused or the content playlist is just randomly teaching you a skill you are not ready to apply. In the end, nothing really goes hand in hand. For this program, you'll have the content and the skills coming as you grow. This content is also exclusive and is made a way to make learning easier and fun for you.\nWe've all experienced the frustration of not being able to scale the game correctly and not being able to point out where you actually are stuck! But, clear out the sheets and start blank today. Even if you know a lot already, repetition for success is the key, and also seeing that you have done what you did so far correctly surely gives you more confidence to move on. If your fundament in Tekken gets right then everything will be right. We will win and still lose, but this time it is on a whole different level!\n\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who has ever wanted to become somewhat good or great at playing Tekken\nLearn fundamentals, understanding the deep learning curve of the game\nPeople who love Tekken and fighting games\nGamers, streamers, and YouTubers\nBeginners and even hardcore gamers\nLocal, competitive, and e-sport players\nThe 3 cores of this course are:\nBuilding the base fundaments with comprehensive and understanding material\nOffense and defense techniques from basic to advanced levels\nDeveloping a proper new gaming mindset that allows you to further explore the game on your own as with others to become better and keep developing your skills after the course.\n\nExperience the course with:\nA lifetime of Tekken gaming experience into several hours of coursing for you!\nLectures emphasizing clarity and how-to patterns\nHands-on demonstration videos for every major concept in the game\nGreat video and audio quality footage\nInteractive worksheets to print and complete\nSupplemental resources and Tekken Community page\nUp-to-date Season 4+\nNow \"Let's get Ready for the Next Battle!\" get you to access today and take your game to the next level!\n\n- Again if you are looking to become a better Tekken gamer in Tekken 8 as well you can still opt into this course!",

      "description": "Hi to everyone. I'm FIDE MASTER Daler Vakhidov. I've been playing chess for about 12 years and working as coach for almost 2 years.\nIn this course you'll leran the Opening ,,Queen's Gambit''. After being realeased this show ( Queen's Gambit) on Netflix many chess players started to play this beautiful opening and already won bunch of games thanks to this opening.During this course I'll teach you how you should play Queen's Gambit Accepted(QGA) and Queen's Gambit Declined(QGD) lines. Simply saying you'll learn to play the Queen's Gambit like Beth Harmon and I hope it helps you to get better positions in the middlegame.\nThe Queen’s Gambit is probably the most popular gambit and although most gambits are said to be unsound against perfect play the queen’s gambit is said to be the exception.\n1. d4 d5\n2. c4\nThe objective of the queen’s gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn to gain control of the center of the board.\nThe Queen’s Gambit is white’s most popular response to the Symmetrical Queen’s Pawn Opening, and the most popular pawn “sacrifice” in chess opening theory by far.\nThe move 2. c4 helps white fight for a space advantage in the center, which is a key component of the Opening Principles.\nOf course, the pawn does seem to be undefended…but let’s examine what happens if black accepts this pawn sacrifice with 2…dxc4\nBlack is temporarily up a pawn, but their control of the center will be greatly reduced. Now or later, white may play e4 and obtain full central control.\n\n\nBlack’s c4 pawn is rather weak. After white moves the e-pawn, white’s light-squared bishop will be eyeing this pawn, and it will be difficult for black to stay a pawn-up in the long run without making significant concessions.\n\n\nBecause of these factors, black often declines the Queen’s Gambit – and the white c-pawn is allowed to remain standing proudly on c4, exerting pressure on the center.\nBlack has many ways to respond to the Queen’s Gambit. Let’s consider some of them below:\n2…e6 (Queen’s Gambit Declined)\n2…c6 (The Slav Defense)\n2…dxc4 (Queen’s Gambit Accepted)\n2…e5 (The Albin Countergambit)\n\n\nAfter learning this new opening you'll start to get pleasant positions in the middlegame and it helps you to win the games. Also, before starting to play this opening please follow some tips where I provided in my last lecture ,,Final recommendations''. Thank you",

      "description": "This course will help you understand the game of chess on a deeper level.\nI have selected 37 vital principles that will improve your play from the opening all the way to the endgame.\nFirst, I honestly asked myself: \"What do I know about the pawns? What about the minor pieces?\"\nThen I asked myself: \"What main principles do I know about the heavy pieces and the king?\"\n\"What other principles have I learned in more than 30 years of playing chess?\"\nYou will find the answers in this course. Obviously, chess is much deeper and more difficult than just a set of principles.\nNevertheless, it is crucial to know and understand the general guidelines. This way, you will not get lost in the woods of this wonderful game.\nI focused on the main ones that would benefit the students the most.\n\n\nLearn and Master Chess Principles with a Successful Grandmaster\nLearn what to do and what not to do with your pawns\nDiscover the preferences of your bishops and your knights\nUnderstand your queen and your rooks and what to do with them\nGet to know what your pieces generally like and what they dislike\nLearn to care about all your pieces\nThis course will boost your chess understanding to the next level\n\n\nThe course is for chess players of all levels. The beginners and hobby chess players will learn the most from this course. Sometimes even the best players in the world can forget or decide to violate these principles.\nObviously, they know them better than I do. They also know when you can break the principle.\nHowever, sometimes it can play a cruel joke on them. The one example that comes to mind is the game I followed closely back in 2015. London Classic 7th, Carlsen (2834) - Nakamura (2793), move 45. Hikaru Nakamura (№5 in the world at that moment in time), played 45...a7-a6 for no apparent reason. I was shocked by the move! He violated the principle \"Pawns do not go backward\". Back then, I only knew that the move was a mistake. Many years later, powerful chess engines proved that the move turned a bad position into a losing one.\nAfter you finish the course, you will learn many more principles, that will help you play better chess. You will understand the deeper fundamental reasons behind those principles. You will know what to do and what not to do. More importantly, you will know why you need to do something, and why you need to avoid doing something.\n\n\nThe course consists of 5 sections,\nSection 1 | Introduction: You will learn what this course is all about. I will tell you how and why I decided to create this course.\nYou will discover that it is important to know, understand and follow the principles in the vast majority of cases.\n\n\nSection 2 | Pawns:  Here, you will find the most important principles about pawns.\nFrançois-André Danican Philidor once famously said the pawns are the soul of chess.\nYou will learn why that is still the case 270 years later!\n\n\nSection 3 | Minor Pieces: You will learn why the bishops are better than knights.\nYou will also understand why knights are more dangerous than bishops.\nYou will study ways to treat your pieces well.\n\n\nSection 4 | Heavy pieces and the King: Do you know the likes and dislikes of your queen?\nDo you know what to do with your rooks and your king?\nMore importantly, do you know why you need to do what you need to do?\nYou will get all the answers in this section.\n\n\nSection 5 | General Principles and Conclusion: You will learn the principles that do not connect to one single piece.\nWhy two minor pieces are usually better than the rook and the pawn?\nHow come the queen is much weaker than the three minor pieces?\nYou will learn the answers to these and other questions in this section.\nAt the end of the course, there would be a downloadable list of the principles.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n- Beginner/hobby chess players who want to play better chess\n- Chess enthusiasts that have studied my previous courses and want to know more\n- Anyone who is interested in understanding the game of chess on a deeper level\n- Chess players that want to have harmonious play from the start to the end of the game",

In Paco Ŝako the pieces do not get 'captured' nor removed from board - they embrace and form unions; mindfulness can be cultivated through action and words that would be seen and heard in a game.\n\nIn this course, you will hear from the inventor of the game, Felix Albers of the Netherlands, and other voices from the international community about what Paco Ŝako means.\n\nWhat does Paco Ŝako mean to you?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will reflect on this journey in understanding the game in response to an assignment about the philosophy of the game. Beyond the course, you may also send us your further thoughts about the game, and either Boon-Yong or Felix shall reply.

If you tried to solve it in the past and failed, worry not...I am here to guide you step by step through my unique method.\nI will be using 3D model software in most of my lectures instead of a real cube. I found out that it makes you see the moves far better, than if I used a real one.\nThe good news that I will not be using notes! Yes, that's right… I did not learn with it, so I will not teach it. Instead, I will show you the moves with arrows and shapes.\nI believe anyone can solve the cube if he learned it like I did, that is learn a few moves and then practice it for a day, and then a few moves and so on, and that's exactly what I will be doing with you.\nAs the title says, you will learn to solve the cube in 4 days... but that does not mean you will be FAST in a week! NO, it will take you some time depends on how much you practice, to solve the cube in 3 minutes or less,and you will learn in a way that will enable you to memorize all the steps in 4 to 7 day.\nSo why take this course? Because it's unique, it's simple, and I don't use the cube's notes.",

      "description": "Dive into the mesmerizing world of chess through the brilliant moves of the 8th World Chess Champion, Mikhail Nekhemyevich Tal, whose unpredictable, attacking style of play earned him the title \"The Magician from Riga\". This course, presented by FIDE CM Kingscrusher, aims to not just celebrate Tal's spectacular games but also extract valuable lessons from them to enhance your own chess journey.\nMikhail Tal's games stand as a testament to his unique combinatory style and audacious sacrifices, a beacon of creativity and flair in the chess world. His ability to use complexity as a weapon against his opponents and his bold, sometimes 'incorrect' sacrifices, opened a new dimension in chess strategy. This course embraces Tal's philosophies and principles, aiming to translate his 'magic' to enthusiastic chess players eager to learn from one of the greatest tacticians of all time.\nTal's games often transcended the bounds of traditional opening theory, making them rich sources of strategic and tactical knowledge. His games, played primarily as a 1.e4 player, are teeming with attacking chess, daring sacrifices, and tactical brilliance, often more featured in chess literature than any other player's.\nThrough a detailed analysis of Tal's games, this course presents an innovative perspective on chess - where the complexity and 'incorrect' sacrifices are not mistakes but strategic tools, where the chessboard transforms into a 'deep dark forest' with its own unconventional logic, where chess becomes a test of character and psychological endurance as much as a battle of wits.\nAs you navigate this course, remember Tal's profound insight: \"You must take your opponent into a deep dark forest where 2+2=5, and the path leading out is only wide enough for one.”\nSo, embark on this journey with us into the enigmatic mind of Mikhail Tal, where each move promises to be a lesson in creativity, courage, and chess tactics that defy conventional wisdom. Let's explore the beautiful chaos of Tal's games, and in the process, discover a new, exciting way to view and play chess.",

This way, results are attained by comparison.\nEach person plays the same hand under the same conditions. If any \"bad luck\" occurs, then it will so be for everyone playing in that position.

      "description": "This course will help you understand what to do after the opening is over.\nThe openings played in this course are from the suggested opening repertoire from the “Understanding chess openings” course. I also used the tactical method from the “Understanding chess tactics” course to deliver the winning combinations.\nYou will benefit from the course even if you have not studied my openings&tactics courses before. I will be explaining all the concepts again in this course. If you want to get a deeper understanding of the concepts (for example, a concept of a semi-protected piece), feel free to check out my previous courses about tactics and openings.\nThis course consists of 25 thoroughly commentated games that I recorded while playing. You will see and hear the ways that grandmasters are thinking. You will also see my mistakes since I will be analyzing the games immediately after they are finished. You will also find a direct link to lichess where you will be able to play through the game or even analyze it with the best chess engine in the world. You will also have free access to the online database there.\nBy the end of the course, you will learn typical combinations that were not covered in the tactics course, get a clear understanding of how to convert your material advantage, discover the typical plans for the main openings, and much more. You will also learn what to do with your pawns and pieces AFTER the opening is over.\n\n\nLearn and Master Chess Middlegame with a Successful Grandmaster\nLearn what to do AFTER the opening\nDiscover typical ideas for the main openings for both colors\nUnderstand how to implement the algorithm from “Understanding chess tactics” in a real game\nStudy an effective “boring” way of converting your material advantage\nGet an honest inside look into the grandmaster’s mind\n\n\nThis course will boost your opening, tactical, and middlegame play to the next level\n\n\nThe course is for chess players of all levels. You will find 16 games with white pieces (All those games start with 1.e4!) and 9 games with black pieces (1.e4 is met with 1…e5! and 1.d4 is met with 1…d5!). Throughout the course, I am doing my best to follow the guidelines that you can learn in my \"Understanding chess openings\" course. You will also learn how to use the tactical signs from the “Understanding chess tactics” course in a real game. Sometimes I was able to MANUFACTURE a tactical combination based on the signs that I discover. Between the opening and the winning combination, I will explain what to do with your pieces and pawns after the development. Once I get a winning advantage, I would teach you the proper way of thinking, and the proper sets of priorities, when it comes to big material advantage. Many chess players do not know what to do AFTER they win some material and how to convert it into a full point. You would NOT be one of those players, once you study this course!\n\n\nThe course consists of 4 sections,\nSection 1 | Introduction: You will learn what this course is all about. There will be a link to the opening repertoire, which I will be using in all the games. The opening repertoire is from the “Understanding chess openings course”. You will also understand my motivation to create the course.\nSection 2 | Games with white pieces: I will show you all the games played with white pieces. First, there would be the games that start with 1.e4-e5 (5 games), then 1.e4-d6 (3 games), 1.e4-c5 (2 games), 1.e4-c6 (2 games), 1.e4-d5 (2 games), 1.e4-g6, and 1.e4-e6. You will learn the idea for white in Petrov defense, Italian game, Philidor defense, Pirc, Sicilian, Caro Kann, Scandinavian, and French defense! The games would be useful to watch even if you do not play the openings yourself. I will be teaching some universal ideas that do not necessarily connect to a particular opening.\nSection 3 | Games with black pieces: You will see all the games that I played with black pieces. First, you will see 6 games that start with 1.e4, and then you will see 3 games with 1.d4. You will learn Petrov’s defense, Italian game, and Queen’s gambit declined. There will also be one game when we enter an equal endgame (the opponent was a very decent player). You will take a glimpse into how to think in the endgame as well.\nSection 4 | Conclusion: You will receive a short summary of the course and my thoughts about the future.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n- Beginner/hobby chess players who want to play good chess from the very first moves\n- Chess enthusiasts that studied my previous courses about tactics and openings and want to know more\n- Anyone who is interested in improving their middlegame play\n- Chess players that want to have harmonious play from the start to the end of the game",

He was champion of Ukraine in 1987 and of Catalonia in 2001, 2005 and 2007. In his surveys he introduces us to his interesting repertoire, which is partially composed of sidelines which offer lots of possibilities for success. Moskalenko lives in Barcelona where he works as a trainer. He is also a successful author of chess books like The Fabulous Budapest Gambit, The Flexible French, Revolutionize Your Chess and The Wonderful Winawer.",

      "description": "José Raúl Capablanca was a Cuban chess player who was the world chess champion from 1921 to 1927.\nHis games are among the clearest of the World champions to understand the fundamentals of positional play and endgame mastery.\nThis course checks out his most important games from early in his career between 1919-1928 and so covers his period of games leading up to becoming World chess champion and beyond.\nWe further examine the \"Human chess machine\" reputation following our first installment for the years 1919-1924. Capablanca lost to Chajes in 1916 and only later to Reti in 1924. This period of being unbeaten in \"serious\" games i.e. not Simul or Exhibition games, led to Capablanca being nicknamed the \"Human Chess Machine\"\nBetween 1916 and the Reti loss, Capablanca played in three tournaments. This was a total run of 44 games before Reti defeated him. He also played two matches against Kostich and Lasker where he played 19 games without a loss. This lifts the unbeaten run to 63 games. Factor in the exhaustion of playing many simuls, and this becomes even more impressive.\nThe course provides an objective analysis of the games without too much bias for the winner. The concept here is that with the \"truth\" of games we can use such games to really improve our play to the maximum. We can also pick up opening theory, middlegame tactics and strategy, and of course endgame strengths through the inspiration of the key Capablanca games chosen in this course. The course bypasses the hundreds of Simul games Capablanca played - perhaps they can be in another course in the future. Instead, the course focuses on the most important tournament and match games of the time period the course has scope for.\nIn the process of creating the course, Kingscrusher himself has experienced more powerful confidence for endgame transitioning and \"small combinations\" - and believes any attentive student will too - and finds many inspirational concepts and philosophies to enrich your chess through game example after example.",

      "description": "Discover the strategic depth of the Nimzo-Larsen Attack in our course 'Nimzo–Larsen Attack Chess Opening with FIDE CM Kingscrusher'. This potent chess opening, characterized by the initial move 1.b3, is as versatile as it is intriguing, capable of delivering wins against any countermove by your opponent. This course presents the tools you need to master this opening, imparting knowledge directly from FIDE CM Kingscrusher.\nThe Nimzo-Larsen Attack is a novel, flank opening move which prepares to fianchetto the Queen's bishop, adding intriguing layers to the game. Not only does it position the player to exert control over the dark squares, it also facilitates attacks if the opponent decides to castle on the Kingside.\nThis opening carries the name of two chess legends: Aron Nimzowitsch, the groundbreaking 'Hypermodern' thinker who authored 'My System', an iconic book that continues to influence generations of players, and Bent Larsen, the esteemed Danish grandmaster who was a contemporary of Bobby Fischer. The course takes an in-depth look at their legacies, giving students historical context to the opening.\nKingscrusher's fascination with the Nimzo-Larsen Attack grew after witnessing its successful deployment by Super-Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura during the ICC Blitz Chess Open in 2011. Despite its underdog status in some circles, the Nimzo-Larsen Attack has proven its worth repeatedly, even in high-level games. Bobby Fischer himself used it to spectacular effect in 1970, winning all five games where he utilized it.\nToday, the opening finds proponents among Grandmasters such as Vladimir Bagirov, Baadur Jobava, Hikaru Nakamura, Richard Rapport, and Adhiban Baskaran. Its potency as a surprise weapon in opening repertoires and its usefulness in faster time controls makes it a compelling choice for both International Masters and Grandmasters.\nThis course will guide you in exploring the unique potential of the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, enabling you to gain tangible advantages right from the opening. Its distinctive classification in online databases allows you to study games from modern exponents, further enriching your understanding of this creative and effective opening.",

I want to share my passion for the game of chess and teach everything that I learn, including one of main opening repertoires.\nMy course is designed to be interactive, as I’ll take you step-by-step through engaging video tutorials.\nStatistically speaking, in the starting position White plays the move 1.e4 (King’s Pawn Opening) or 1.d4 (Queen’s Pawn Opening) in over 80% of the games.\nThat’s why we’ll create a very detailed and aggressive opening repertoire to meet these 2 openings, where we will not only aim to get a good position, but to fight for an advantage as well.\nAfter our main repertoire is prepared, we’ll study all the other 18 possible moves that White has to start the game. The key will be to cover these options in a smart way, aiming to transpose into lines that we have already studied if White plays good moves. But we’ll also aim for an early opening advantage if White decides to play dubious moves.\nThis course includes practical activities in every section to make sure that you'll test your new knowledge. I’ll provide you with all the games and variations that I’ll analyze so that you can download them and keep them, both in PDF and PGN format.\nThroughout this comprehensive course, we’ll study a lot of openings and variations, including:\nThe Sicilian Defense, Dragon Variation\nThe Sicilian Defense, Prins Variation\nThe Sicilian Defense, Hungarian Variation\nThe Sicilian Defense, Moscow Variation\nThe Sicilian Defense, Closed Variation\nThe Sicilian Defense, Alapin Variation\nThe King's Indian Defense\nThe Trompowsky Attack\nThe Torre Attack\nThe London System\nThe Colle System\nThe Zukertort Opening\nThe English Opening\nThe Benko Opening\nThe Larsen Attack\nThe Bird’s Opening\nThe Van Geet Opening\nThe Polish Opening\nThe Van’t Krujis Opening\nMieses Opening\nThis course is ideal for intermediate players, who want to bring their opening knowledge to a new level.\nBy the end of this course, you will improve both your overall openings skills, in addition to having a complete opening system to play as Black.\nA Present to Make Your Life Easier\nStudying openings and creating a full repertoire can be overwhelming. My main goal with my courses is to simplify your study. As a lifelong learner of this game, I know how having the right tools can save you not only months, but years of study.\nAll the lines and games that I cover in the course will be provided to you under each lesson. For your convenience, I’ll provide them in 2 different formats: PDF and PGN. PGN (Portable Game Notation) is a standard format for recording chess games supported by most chess software.\nThis way, you have more than one option to choose your preferred way to save and keep your lifetime repertoire.\nSign up today, and look forward to:\nVideo Lectures\nPractical Activities\nDownloads\nModel Games Covered in the Course With Analysis Included\nInstructor Q&A\nLifetime Access",

O foco desse curso é que você mude a sua maneira de pensar, lembrando que suas decisões devem ser baseadas na sua posição e também nas decisões que o seu adversário toma. Veremos um pouco de teoria, mas principalmente os exemplos na prática, e os erros mais comuns que os nossos adversários fazem e como explorá-los da melhor maneira!\nUso como exemplo partidas da Internet para os níveis iniciante e intermediário, buscando explorar erros típicos por parte do preto e nos últimos capítulos o foco é em partidas presenciais entre Grandes Mestres, quando as pretas jogam de maneira mais precisa. Essa última parte do curso é instrutiva para todos os níveis, mas tem uma profundidade de análise maior comparado com os outros capítulos do curso, então será mais adequada para jogadores de nível avançado.\nAlém dos vídeos, o aluno vai ter acesso ao material de apoio, onde analiso com mais detalhe e com mais profundidade as variantes mencionadas. Assim como meus outros cursos, vamos ter o grupo no WhatsApp para os alunos tirarem dúvidas comigo e interagirem entre si.",

      "description": "Embark on an extraordinary journey through the pivotal years of Bobby Fischer's chess career, from his landmark World Championship victory in 1972 to his dramatic return in 1992, with our course, 'Bobby Fischer's Most Instructive Games of Chess 1970-1992.' Guided by Kingscrusher, this course delves deep into the evolution of Fischer's chess mastery during these transformative years.\nDiscover the breadth of Fischer's opening repertoire, showcasing his dominant use of 1.e4, alongside surprising forays into 1.c4, and even 1.b3, enriching his strategic diversity with moves like the Alekhine's Defense. Explore Fischer's tactical warfare against various defenses, including his innovative strategies against the Sicilian Defense, Ruy Lopez, Caro-Kann, French Defense, and Pirc/Modern Defense, offering a comprehensive view of his approach as white.\nFischer's expertise wasn't limited to playing white; as black, his command over the Sicilian Najdorf significantly influenced chess legends like Garry Kasparov. Yet, Fischer's versatility shone through his adept use of the King's Indian Defense, Nimzo-Indian Defense, and Modern Benoni Defense, demonstrating his tactical agility and strategic depth.\nDelve into Fischer's middle game, where his aggressive strategies often concluded matches within 30 moves, showcasing his exceptional tactical genius. His endgame prowess, especially in Bishop vs. Knight scenarios, offers invaluable lessons in transitioning to and dominating endgame play.\nThe course also highlights Fischer's unparalleled will to win, seen in his meticulous preparation and psychological strategies that align with Sun Tzu's Art of War principles. His legendary 'Match of the Century' against Spassky in 1972 serves as a prime example of Fischer's strategic genius, where his adaptability and innovative tactics were on full display.\nFischer's embodiment of the Art of War's maxim, 'putting oneself beyond defeat before going on the attack,' is vividly illustrated in his use of the King's Indian Defense, showcasing his strategic acumen in securing one flank before launching decisive attacks.\nThrough this course, experience the brilliance of Fischer's games, understanding his evolving style and the strategic innovations that challenged the Soviet chess hegemony. 'Bobby Fischer's Most Instructive Games of Chess 1970-1992' offers a deep dive into the mind of a chess legend, providing a rich source of learning and inspiration for chess enthusiasts eager to elevate their own game.",

If so, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Play Like a Pro is your opportunity to learn skills and strategies from a seasoned professional, gain a deeper understanding of fundamental game concepts, and become a more well-rounded competitor.\nMy name is Jordan “n0thing” Gilbert and I’ve been playing Counter-Strike for 18 years, with the last decade of my career playing competitively with top-level teams such as Evil Geniuses in CS 1.6 and Cloud9 for the majority of CS:GO. During my time as a pro I spent at least a few days a week coaching individuals playing CS:GO at various levels. After multiple years of individual coaching, I found that teaching the community as a whole via my Twitch streams and YouTube videos was more effective in reaching many more people! I’ve wanted to create a course like this for awhile and have a collection of tips and tricks learned over my decade of competitive experience to share with aspiring CS:GO players. My goal is to help shape how you view and play the game, and in the end create more well rounded players out of everyone who takes this course.\nThis course is built for players familiar with CS:GO who aspire to play at a higher level. I will help you master various skills by providing lectures, in-game examples, and practical tips that apply to each topic. Specifically, this course will cover:\n*Intro sections include background on myself and my journey to pro, before jumping into the following*\nSetting up CS:GO and finding the configuration that works for you\nMastering game mechanics, including:\nAiming\nCrosshair placement\nRecoil control\nGrenade usage\nAngles & positioning\nMovement\nCommunicating effectively and efficiently during the three round phases, Solo Q and team play\nStrategizing for early, mid, and late round play on both the CT and T side\nDeveloping a process-oriented attitude to continually practice, improve your game, and avoid “ladder anxiety” as well as getting down on yourself\nUtilizing offline servers to help practice outside “the game”\nUtilizing community servers (DM, Retake, Surf/KZ)\nFinding mentors and playing with/against better players\nApproaching individual practice for maximum improvement\nYou’ll also get your hands dirty in-game by completing the activities and drills provided in each section. While the lectures will cover my best practices and key concepts for playing CS:GO, the activities will be your chance to apply what you’ve learned and find what works best for you.\nI know that this course will help you not only fine-tune your skills in-game, but also to develop the professional attitude and practice-focused mindset that got me to where I am today. By the end of this course, you will be prepared for competitive play no matter what level you started at. If you’re ready to start the journey to high-level CS:GO, enroll in this course today.

Whether or not you win or lose is determined by your\nopening preparation\n, your\nmiddlegame skills\n, and your\nendgame technique\n.\nAt the same time, the opening phase is MORE important because if you don’t play it well, you will lose sooner than you can demonstrate your middlegame/endgame skills.\nHow do you play an opening successfully?\n1) You need to choose the right opening variations (your opening repertoire), and learn the NECESSARY lines within them.\n2) You need to know the general rules/principles of opening play, and how you can find correct moves in unknown opening positions.\nRegarding the 1st item –\nopening variations\n– there are a lot of existing chess books/DVDs about virtually any opening that you can think of. Some of these tutorials are even pretty good. However, there are still some problems here:\n- Studying various opening variations takes a lot of your time.\n- As we’ve already discussed, you can’t learn everything anyway.\n- Your opponents have access to the same tutorials that you have.\n- There are opening tutorials about all possible opening variations, and you don’t know what will work best for YOU.\nAs for the 2nd item –\nthe general rules/principles of an opening play\n– this topic is almost completely missing!\nBy studying the course \"How to play chess with black pieces\" you'll acquire a solid weapon against 1.d4 move. You'll learn everything that you need in 1 neat course. The opening variations are analyzed deeply yet they are easy to digest. Finally, the detailed explanations will help you understand the opening moves and remember them flawlessly.\nThe course contains 6 main sections - each one is dedicated to one of the main lines of the Nimzo-Indian Defense. Firstly, you'll learn a video lesson that will guide you through the main plans, ideas and variations of a particular line. Next, you'll find extensive analysis of the lines in the practical part.",

In this particular course I will teach you all openings that happen after 1.e4.\nThis course is for Beginners and Intermediate players. In order to fully benefit from this course you just need to know how the pieces move and some basic rules.\nI've been teaching chess for more than 15 years and I know exactly what you need to know in order to get good positions out of the opening. I recommend the best lines to play for white and black.\nIn this course I recorded 20 Chess Openings that will help you understand which Opening is right for you. If you play 1.e4, this course will help you obtain better positions in the middlegame and you will understand what your plan is.\nWhen you play with black pieces you must know how to play against 1.e4, so this course will teach you how to deal with it as well. You won't have to memorize much as we will not go too deep.\nAll lessons are very easy to follow and for your convenience I am adding a PGN file for all the openings that we will go over.  Thank you so much for your attention! Enjoy!",

      "description": "Una delle scelte più difficili per un principiante che si avvicina al gioco degli scacchi è la scelta dell’apertura. Ci sono così tante aperture, e così tanta teoria.\nQuali sono le migliori aperture per i principianti?\nOvviamente non c’è una risposta esatta dipende molto dal modo in cui vogliamo affrontare lo studio dell’apertura e dalle nostre ambizioni.\nSecondo la mia esperienza un giocatore che ha iniziato da poco ad avvicinarsi allo studio degli scacchi ha bisogno di qualcosa di solido, veloce da imparare, senza troppa memorizzazione richiesta.\nPer questo motivo il corso in questione consiglia le seguenti aperture:\n(Tieni presente che un giocatore ha bisogno di almeno due aperture con il Nero - una contro 1.e4 e una contro 1.d4 - e una con il Bianco.)\nCon il Bianco, il London System.\nUn apertura che garantisce uno sviluppo regolare e una posizione solida al centro.\nPuò essere appreso facilmente poiché le mosse del Bianco sono quasi automatiche: 1.d4, 2.Bf4, 3.e3, 4.Nf3, 5.c3, 6.Nbd2 (queste ultime due mosse possono essere giocate in ordine invertito) , 7.Bd3 (o 7.Be2) e arrocco.\nIl bianco ha una posizione solida con un buon controllo e sviluppo del centro e nessun punto debole.\nCon il nero contro 1.e4: Difesa scandinava\nÈ semplice e facile da imparare, non c'è molta teoria e le idee alla base sono facili da memorizzare. Per darvi un esempio concreto, vi ho consigliato la Difesa Scandinava con 3… Da5 (dopo 1.e4 d5 2.ed Qxd5 3.Nc3) .\n\n\nNella sessione finale del corso otterrai invece delle raccomandazioni di come vanno studiate le aperutre e come bisognerebbe fare per crearsi un repertorio da zero.\nAlla fine del corso saprai esattamente cosa fare in apertura (prime 10 mosse, grosso modo), come farlo e, cosa ancora più importante, PERCHÉ devi farlo.\n\n\n\n\nIl tuo insegnante:\n\n\nCiao!\nSono il Grande Maestro di scacchi Roberto Mogranzini. Gioco da quando avevo 6 anni e da oltre 20 insegno scacchi a tutti i livelli.\nLa mia passione per gli scacchi mi ha portato a scegliere questo sport come professione e oltre ad insegnare organizzo tornei ed eventi legati a questa disciplina.\nDal 2018 sono l'unico SENIOR FIDE TRAINER, che è la qualifica più alta per un istruttore, e quest'anno mi sono classificato 10° al Campionato Italiano.\nTra le persone che ho allenato negli anni ci sono diversi campioni italiani e un campione del mondo!\n\nVuoi essere il prossimo campione?",

İki at savunması bildiğimiz italyan partisi kadar çok eski bir açılışlardan birisi sayılır çok sayıda teorik devam yolları bulunmaktadır ve ben bildiğim kadar en iyi şekilde bunları iki bölümde sizlere anlatmaya çalıştım. Onun dışında bu eğitim dizilerine başladığınızda mutlaka satranç tahtasında tekrar etmeyi unutmayalım çünkü varyasyonlar çok olduğundan dolayı karıştırabilir siniz.. karışmasın diye her hamlenin amacını planlarını en iyi şekilde sizlere sunmaya çalıştım. Siyah taşlarla ise anlatarak 12 . Bölümde ise  Fransız savunmasının Tarraş kapalı piyon yapısında çok güzel eğitici fedalardan yararlanarak kazandığım klasik bir maçı sundum umarım beğenirsiniz. Şimdi en sonunda ise bu anlattıklarımın pratik kısmını ise satranç platforumlarında çok sıkı bir şekilde maçları özelliklede rapid maçlarını sıkı bir şekilde yaparsanız kendinizi pratik satrancında da iyi hissedersiniz diye umuyorum . Her bir teori açılışımızın pratik deneyimi ve provaları da olmalıdır . Genelde tematik turnuvalar yapılır ve öyle geliştirilir .O zaman sizlere keyifli iyi seyirler dilerim bol şanslar .",

Most club level players struggle with creating a schedule for an effective study plan, what to study & how to study.\nStudent 2 : Number of hours per day spent on each aspect of chess? How and what to train with only 1-2 free hours per week?\nStudent 3 : How to make steady progress? How to get the best out of chess books, chess software, playing online and puzzles? A course about how someone should analyze his game is very useful.\nStudent 4 : How to work as best when alone? Many chess players cannot offer themselves the aid of a coach for geographical or financial reasons.\nIgor is the founder of the “Remote Chess Academy\" company that has helped thousands of students worldwide to improve their chess results.\nGM Smirnov has developed lots of chess video lessons, articles, webinars and training courses, including the famous courses “The Grandmaster's Secrets\", “The Grandmaster's Positional Understanding\", and “Calculate Till Mate\".",

      "description": "ABOUT THE COURSE\nMid lane is perhaps one of the easiest roles to carry a game from, but one of the hardest roles to master.\nI'm sure we've all experienced  the enemy mid laner dominating the game, roaming what seems like constantly throughout the game and still being able to win the game just for you to see angry messages from your teammates pop up in chat, \"Mid difference is insane\".\nI'm here to teach you how to be the insane difference that will win you the game, specifically playing the champion Ahri.  If you are considering picking up mid lane I would suggest Ahri because she has a very low ban rate, and she's never really been hard nerfed to the point where she's unplayable.\nShe's a solid champion all round and can be played in different styles:  you can play \"Assassin style\", which is where you use your ultimate aggressively and pick off the carries of the enemy team by ulting over a wall to get the pick and back from the wall for safety- leaving you in a 5v4 without the enemy main carry.\nOr you can play her more passively and hold your ultimate till the enemy engage on you to kite back and still hit your abilities to deal large amounts of damage. Ahri doesn't exactly see a lot of competitive matches but she is for sure considered a soloq champion and it's very reasonable to be able to 1v9 every single game after watching this guide.\nMEET YOUR INSTRUCTOR\nIn this course your instructor is Lupin. He has 2 years experience in coaching with 1 year of that being pro national league teams. He's been playing the game since season 3 and has been maining Ahri for the last 2 seasons. Peaking at D5 after 3 months of maining her on a fresh unranked account. In this course he will teach you not only how to use Ahri in team fights and her combos but also the fundamentals that every mid laner should have. Weather you're looking to pick up a champion to climb in soloq or just a champion to have fun with, Ahri is a wonderful pick because she offers a lot of creativity to invent new things with her kit and deals lots of damage.\nIn this course you learn the basic and advanced combos of Ahri along with:\nLaning Phase\nHow to play when you hit level 2 & 6 before the enemy mid laner.\nHow to track the enemy jungler and use it to your advantage.\nHow to roam and realize when you have the potential to do so.\nTeam Fights\nUsing your charm to turn a uneven numbered fight into an even numbered fight.\nPlaying more passively in team fights and using your ultimate defensively to kite the enemy.\nThe basics of team fighting with Ahri.",

Maybe you don’t have any clue what it is, but you don’t want to ask the kids to explain it, because they will give you THAT look (like you’re dumb or something) not to mention, they aren’t the best with details. Yeah, we’ve all been there. I’ll give you the scoop, step by step on what Minecraft is, what it is good for, and how to get started, so you can try it out for yourself if you want. I’ll treat you like an adult and show you what the kids are up to.\n\nWhy this course? Here's what you get:\nInstead of listening to high-pitched 12 year olds on YouTube talk for hours on end and never get to the point, I’ll give you everything you need to know about finding diamonds in a concise, useful format that allows you to pause the video, and try it out yourself. This is the de facto crash course in video game awesomeness from a parent of 5 and veteran Minecrafter. Whether you are a parent, a teacher, an aunt, uncle, grandparent or godparent I’ve got you covered.\nYou'll be able to save the day, in game and out:\nIf you’re too busy to sit down and play -- totally understandable, we all work for a living -- you still won’t be in the dark (where the bad guys are), because you’ll have a great reference for later when you need it. I’ll even show you how to fix problems, repair corrupted files in seconds, and even beat the game. Don't worry, you can do it with my help. You'll be the Minecraft hero and you won’t even have to wear a cape. Unless you’re into that or whatever.\n\n\nHere's what you get from this course?\n4.5+ hours of HD Video, taught in a conversational style by an expert that will help you learn by experience\nThe help and support of a responsive instructor who can answer questions and help with problems at any point\nGood for a parents, teachers, aunts, uncles, grandparents, godparents or anyone who wants to know what Minecraft is about and why the kids can’t get enough.",

Explore the sport (yes, Checkers is a sports discipline!) that has taken me to over 30 countries, taught me languages, and introduced me to many interesting people from around the world, with whom I have maintained contact for years!\n\n\nWhen only 3 pieces are left on the checkerboard - there are thousands of possibilities, with 4 pieces - tens of thousands, and with 6 - I can't even name those numbers. And yet, we start playing International Checkers with a total of 20 pieces.\n\n\nThere are many variations of checkers, which differ to a greater or lesser extent in their rules. The most prestigious variant of Checkers worldwide is the 100-square International Checkers, where everyone plays by the same international rules. Achieving the world champion title in this variant brings the highest possible satisfaction. Importantly, the techniques learned on the 100-square checkerboard can be successfully applied in other variants, including the 64-square checkers!\n\n\nEmbark with me on an incredible journey to the wonderful world of Checkers - a game that will enhance analytical skills, logical thinking, memory, and concentration. Utilize my 25 years of competitive experience and over 15 years as a Checkers instructor, which led me to the World Champion title in 2023. Discover the world of Checkers, a sport that knows no bounds and can become a lifelong passion.\n\n\nThe course includes:\n60 minutes of video material,\n8 lectures,\npractical examples,\ndiversed tactics and strategies.\n\n\nI will teach you how to quickly win at Checkers through so-called combinations, tactical ways of using the rules to your advantage. You will also learn how to create opportunities to defeat the opponent even when no combination can be executed. I'll show you how to play in different phases of a Checkers game - at the beginning (the opening), in the middle game, and in endgames. You will learn both basic strategy (positional play) and tactics (combinational play), which constantly interweave during a game of Checkers.",

W kursie pokazuję wszystkie najważniejsze warianty jakie mogą na Ciebie czekać, omawiam idee i plany, bo nauka szachów to przede wszystkim zrozumienie co się dzieje na szachownicy. Dlatego po kilku godzinach słuchania o planach i wariantach będziesz mieć okazję zobaczyć praktyczne partie jakie grałem w tym debiucie i na tej podstawie sprawdzić swoją nowo nabytą wiedzę.\nIstota gambitu północnego jest bardzo prosta – bardzo szybko ruszamy do ataku, bez oglądania się na stratę pionka lub nawet dwóch. Cel jest jeden – jak najszybciej rozwinąć figury i do ataku! Dlatego na samym początku gry zamieniamy policzalny materiał, czyli pionki, na przewagę w rozwoju, czyli większą siłę, jakość i aktywność naszych figur. Naprawdę trudno nie polubić tego lekko szalonego gambitu, ale szachy mają dawać radość z gry. Pierwszy raz zagrałem ten gambit ponad 20 lat temu. Grałem to z powodzeniem na poważnych turniejach jak I liga drużynowych mistrzostw Polski i frajdę z grania mam do dzisiaj.\nMam nadzieję, że ten kurs nie tylko sprawi, że zostaniesz specjalistą od tego gambitu, lecz również lepiej zrozumiesz w jaki sposób aktywnie, szybko i agresywnie prowadzić atak w szachach.\nZapraszam do oglądania i życzę miło spędzonego czasu na nauce!",

You should be in a much better position by training with this course to create beautiful chess combinations on the chessboard which feature a wide range of patterns and demonstrate amazing calculation ability.  In short, the goal of the course is to make you a very strong chess tactician and help you enjoy your chess to the absolute maximum.\nThis course has a structure which is essentially is \"process\" and \"patterns\".\nPROCESS: The Art of Chess Calculation\nThe \"process\" aspect is the art of chess calculation. Even if you didn't know a single tactical pattern by name, you could still play amazing tactics just with great calculation which the course gives you a solid foundation in. Yes, even if you didn't know your forks from your pins, the \"Process\" part of the course as in the art of calculation, would still enable you to play great chess combinations using an entire orchestra of tactical patterns without even knowing their names.\nBut training yourself on patterns will enhance your art of calculation and you will be able to name the key tactical patterns that are important for searching them out to practice and discuss with others as well as prompt during your calculations.\n\"Process\" is like the software of your chess mind. \"Patterns\" are like the Content for that software. You need both the software and the content to be really effective as a tactician!.\n\nPROCESS and PATTERNS\n\nYOUR STRENGTHS OF POSITION (PLUSSES +'s)  MATCH WITH (MINUSES -'s)\nDOWNSIDES OF OPPONENTS POSITION (FOR MAXIMUM DIFFERENTIAL between the PLUS AND MINUS)\nBOTTOM UP APPROACHES vs. TOP DOWN APPROACHES\nPatterns help feed the process of calculation. Your goal often is to create a maximum differential between the strengths of your position, which can be realised from very strong calculation skills, and the downsides of the opponent's position, which often requires a trained intuition and eye for potential downsides to ensure you are even aware combinational solutions might exist.\n\nPATTERNS: Tactical Patterns, Mating Patterns, Weakness of Position patterns.\nThe \"patterns\" aspect is divided into three key \"pattern\" areas:\nBold ones below represent really key and frequent visitors to most people's games\nTactical Patterns (alphabetically)\nThese tactical patterns are very useful to practice and help internalise.\nAbsolute Pin\nAdvanced Pawn\nAnnihilation of Defence\nAlekhine’s Gun\nAttraction\nBattery\nBlockading defensive resources\nCapture\nCapture the Defender\nChecks - gaining key tempo e.g. winning material via checks\nClearance\nCombine and Win tactics\nConnected passed pawns\nCounterplay management move\nCounter Threat\nCross-check\nCross-pin\nDecoy\nDeflection\nDemolition of Pawns around opponent's king\nDemolition of Pawn Structure\nDesperado\nDiscovered Attack\nDomination\nDouble Attack\nDouble Check\nDraw Tactics\nEndgame Tactics\nExchange sacrifice\nf2 (or f7) weakness\nForcing Moves\nFork\nGoal Hanging Tactics e.g. N on f5 (also see Thorn pawn)\nGreek Gift Sacrifice\nIndirect Defense\nInterference\nIntermediate move (synonym: Zuichenzug)\nKing Aggression in Endgames\nKing Chase\nLiberational tactics\nOpposition\nOverload the defender\nWeakness of last move\nPassed pawn creation\nPawn-Fork\nPawn Tactics\nPawn Breakthrough\nPerpetual Attack\nPerpetual Check\nPins - Absolute\nPins - Relative\nPins - Celebration\nPositional Tactic\nProphylaxis move\nRemoving King Escape Squares\nRook lift\nSacrifice (Positional)\nSacrifice (calculated)\nSimplification\nQueen and Bishop Battery\nQuiet but killer move (greatly used in Alekhine combinations)\nRelative Pin\nRemove the Defender\nSacrifice\nSimplification\nSituational Pin\nSoft spot sacrifice\nStrategic Crush tactic - e.g. locking in bishop, good knight\nSkewer\nStalemate Tactics\nTempo Tactics\nThorn Pawns\nThreat making\nTrapped Piece\nTriangulation\nTwo Rooks Battery\nTwo Rooks on 7th Rank\nUnder-promotion\nWeak Back-Rank\nWeakness of last move\nWindmill\nX-Ray\nX-Ray Attack\nX-Ray Defense\nZugzwang\nZwischenzug\nMating Patterns (alphabetically)\nThese mating patterns are useful to practice and help internalise.\nAnastasia's mate\nAnderssen's mate\nArabian mate\nBack-rank mate\nBishop and knight mate\nBlackburne's mate\nBlind swine mate\nBoden's mate\nBox mate (Rook mate)\nCombine and Win Mate\nCorner mate\nCozio's mate\nDamiano's bishop mate\nDamiano's mate\nDavid and Goliath mate\nDouble bishop mate\nDovetail mate\nEpaulette mate\nFool’s mate\nGreco's mate\nHook mate\nKill Box mate\nKing and two bishops mate\nKing and two knights mate\nLadder checkmate\nLégal mate\nLolli's mate\nMax Lange's mate\nMayet's mate\nMorphy's mate\nOpera mate\nPillsbury's mate\nQueen mate\nRéti's mate\nSmothered mate\nSupport mate\nSuffocation mate\nSwallow's tail mate\n\"Opponent Downsides\" aka \"Tactical Issues\" aka \"Tactical Liabilities\" aka \"Weakness of Position\" Patterns\nThese help you intuitively identify if a combination may exist in the position.\nAwkward Pieces (trappable)\nKing Safety Issues e.g. Back rank\nLoose pieces (unprotected)\nOverworked pieces\nPieces away from King\nTactical Liabilities in general\nWeaknesses in general",

In this course, you will watch me go over various topics about the game, starting with the basic mechanics and then moving onto the more difficult things such as potions and biomes. I will be showing you multiple things, and you can pause the videos at any moment so you don't get confused. Alternatively, you can wait until the video is finished and then go back at your own pace. By the end of this course, you should be able to play on any server with your friends. You may even want to thrive in your creative or survival world, depending on how adventurous you are feeling. Please note that the basics cover nearly all versions of Minecraft. I will be doing the course in version 1.16.5, as it is the newest stable version by the time this is posted. I will also be doing some of the videos in survival mode so you can learn from example. Most of the videos are in creative since I need to set them up in order to give you a proper guide. If I were to go over all of these topics in pure survival, it would take a few hours. An example of this would be about the End, since I need to teach people without the Ender Dragon flinging me up into the sky. When I am in creative, I will make sure to play as if I am in survival. I appreciate all of you taking your time to read this, and hopefully my teachings can help you play the game. Experts learned through experience, so this is your first step into being an experienced Minecraft player.",

In this course I teach you how to use your king activeness, better pawn structure and reserve tempos forcing your opponent to worsen his position.\nIf you are a strong chess player, you may know that deep calculation helps to win pawn endgames, and I would agree with you. But anyway if you know what plan to apply in a certain position, you may calculate fewer lines.\nThis course consists of 15 lectures. In every lecture I cover a certain motif which can be applied in any pawn endgame. At the end of the course I prepared a quiz for you.\nI designed this course for beginners and club players with FIDE rating from 1200 to 2000. But if you don’t have FIDE rating, this is not a problem and it shouldn’t stop you from taking this course. Even if you are a strong player, you may not know some tricks which can be applied in pawn endgames. Learn them from this course!\n\nAfter finishing this course, your chances to win approximately equal pawn endgame will improve.\nWith this course you also get:\nunlimited lifetime access at no extra costs\nall future additional lectures, game examples\nnever any questions asked full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\nSincerely,\nViktor",

      "description": "Venture into the exciting realm of the Smith-Morra Gambit with this comprehensive course, designed to arm you with an aggressive and potent weapon against the ubiquitous Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5). This gambit, named after Pierre Morra and Ken Smith, has been championed by modern International Masters such as Marc Esserman and even used with success by Kingscrusher in his celebrated YouTube blitz games.\nThis course is designed to tackle the Sicilian Defence head-on, taking the fight to black from the get-go with 1.e4 c5 2.d4! The Smith-Morra Gambit offers white rapid development, open lines, and attacking chances in return for a pawn - a perfect strategy if you enjoy sharp, tactical battles.\nRenowned for its simplicity of play and high probability of occurrence in real games, the Smith-Morra Gambit also serves as an effective counter-weapon to the wealth of theory that Sicilian Defence players tend to be armed with.\nIn this course, we dissect common black responses, whether they accept or decline the gambit. We lay bare the weaknesses in black's setups, back our analysis with cutting-edge chess engine verifications, and highlight innovative strategies that may not have seen the light of day before.\nSome of the systems and variations we analyze include:\nAccepting the Gambit: Classical Main Line, Scheveningen setup, Siberian Variation, Nge7 variations, a6 Defence, Fianchetto Variation, Chicago Defence, Early queenside fianchetto, Finegold Defence.\nDeclining the Gambit: Early Qa5 pinning move, Push variation, Nf6 Alapin Variation transpositions, d5 style, e5 style, e6 style, and very early deviations after 2.d4.\nIn addition to the detailed opening analysis, the course offers a trove of middlegame tactics and strategies, helping to develop your overall chess understanding. A series of tactical puzzles keeps you engaged, pushing you to solve problems and improve your game dynamically.\nWhether you're new to the Smith-Morra Gambit or looking to bolster your existing repertoire, this course provides you with a roadmap to navigate the complexities of the Sicilian Defence and unchain the latent power of this underexplored opening system.",

      "description": "Mastering an opening repertoire is a vital part of any chess player's strategy. It guides you through the early intricacies of the game, laying the groundwork for the unfolding match. If you seek a robust and reliable opening when playing with the Black pieces, look no further than the Caro-Kann defense.\nOur course offers an all-inclusive, proven repertoire for handling the complexities of playing Black against 1.e4, with a focus on the Caro-Kann defense. This defense, favored by World Chess Champions like Jose Raul Capablanca, Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, and Anatoly Karpov, provides a reliable response to 1.e4, allowing for strategic over tactical play.\nYou'll learn how the Caro-Kann can neutralize aggressive tactical players, mirroring Botvinnik's success in his 1961 rematch against Mikhail Tal. We delve into why the Caro-Kann often lacks the forcing variations seen in the Sicilian defense, making it easier to learn and ideal for those preferring strategic play.\nWe start with an introduction to the Caro-Kann defense, its history, and the distinctive traits of its various variations. Key focus is placed on the Advance and Exchange Variations, but we also cover the Panov–Botvinnik Attack, the Fantasy Variation, the Two Knights Variation, and other sidelines that you might face.\nOur course dives into the key concepts, strategic plans, and tactics essential for each variation, alongside addressing the potential pitfalls and strengths.  We guide you on mitigating these challenges and maximizing your position's potential.\nWe provide recommendations for:\nMain Line: 2.d4 d5 – 3. Nc3 and 3. Nd2\nAdvance Variation: 3. e5\nExchange Variation: 3. exd5\nPanov–Botvinnik Attack: 4. c4\nFantasy Variation: 3. f3\nTwo Knights Variation: 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 (or 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3)\nEarly Queen move 2. Qe2\nSuitable for players ranging from beginners to advanced, this course starts from the basics and progresses to intricate concepts, facilitating learning at your own pace.\nBy the course's end, you'll possess a comprehensive, engine-approved opening repertoire against 1.e4, one that's fun, easy to play, and statistically sound. You'll confidently navigate the Caro-Kann defense, setting the stage for a successful game.\nTake the plunge now! Enroll and start your journey to mastering the Caro-Kann defense today!",

Follow his journey to the international San Sebastián tournament in 1918, where despite initial protests over his entry, he emerged victorious, proving his critics wrong with dazzling displays of skill and strategy.\nIn this course, we strive to provide an unbiased analysis of Capablanca's games, aiming to bring out the 'truth' of the games to help you improve your own play to the maximum. This course will enrich your understanding of opening theory, middlegame tactics and strategy, and the art of playing the endgame.\nWhile the course intentionally bypasses Capablanca's hundreds of Simul games to focus on his most important tournament and match games of this period, the lessons learned here will undoubtedly enhance your confidence and skills in chess. Indeed, by studying the games of Capablanca, you will uncover inspirational concepts and philosophies that can elevate your game to new heights.",

      "description": "Chess isn't just a game; it's an intricate dance culminating in the ultimate checkmate. This course, 'The Art of Checkmate,' encapsulates this concept, focusing on the patterns and processes that enable and accentuate the beauty of checkmate opportunities.\nBeing able to effectively deliver checkmate can often change the dynamics of your game, incentivizing more aggressive and tactical play. In some cases, you could potentially sacrifice all pieces except one, to deliver that final, decisive move. As such, understanding checkmate patterns and strategies introduces a plethora of dynamic opportunities in chess middlegames, often leading to a more aggressive and attacking style of play.\nThe course's curriculum explores different forms of checkmate, taking an artistic perspective to delve into the depth of this fundamental concept. This includes basic forms of checkmate that introduce existing patterns, encouraging a more profound understanding of the game's mechanics and stimulating deeper calculations.\nHowever, checkmate isn't solely about trapping the opponent's king; it's also about strategic displacement. In some instances, you may need to coax your adversary's king from its shelter, creating a compelling artistic spectacle. This can range from luring the opponent's king across the board to merely attracting it slightly towards your pieces, revealing the importance of king safety and creating a seemingly effortless artistic effect.\nEven though the king enjoys relative freedom during endgames, it isn't exempt from the dangers of a potential checkmate. Thus, being mindful of checkmate dangers even during endgames is crucial and might be the key to winning certain endgames.\n'The Art of Checkmate' course is a comprehensive exploration of this essential chess concept, designed to enhance your understanding, stimulate strategic thinking, and refine your skills in delivering the definitive game-ending move.",

Millions of people were encouraged to learn and play chess after The Queen's Gambit, The Netflix Original Series, the statistics of the chess websites went up in terms of new players. By analyzing openings, solving strategies and playing as many games as possible, that's how players are usually starting their chess journey. Do you see what's wrong? A big part of chess, namely The Endgame, is losing out on these players. It usually begins after 35 moves approximately, and there are no many pieces left on the board. The endgame has consistently been an exceptionally informative period of chess play. It gives an ideal chance to see every chess piece's expected force in each chess position—from opening move to checkmate. In any case, the endgame is frequently seen as a blocked off play zone by most players who are limited. This course is designed to strengthen your chess abilities through the basic concepts of endgames to valuing your pieces and better calculating, as well as a better understanding of pawn structures and opening and middle game.",

En el tratamos de mostrar las lineas mas competitivas y fáciles de aprender para el dominio de esta defensa. El curso esta integrado de 7 capítulos con sus respectivos vídeos y pgn's abarcando las lineas mas comunes y también las poco comunes de la siciliana Paulsen. Se denomina variante Paulsen al siguiente orden de jugadas:1.e4 c5 2.C3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Cxd4 a6. Es uno de los dispositivos más flexibles para el negro. Con sus movidas de peones controlan los saltos de caballo y observan de qué manera el blanco desarrolla sus piezas para luego poder ubicar sus trebejos de la manera más adecuada. La Paulsen goza de mucha popularidad en la actualidad, tal es así que en el reciente match por el título del mundo el retador y campeón mundial el GM indio Viswanathan Anand la jugó frente al actual titular de la corona el GM noruego Magnus Carlsen.\nLa variante debe su nombre a Louis Paulsen (1833-1891). El GM canadiense Kevin Spraggett lo considera el padre de la teoría de las aperturas modernas, debido a la infinidad de aportes que ha realizado en la primera etapa de la partida",

Known for his expertise in exchange sacrifice, prophylaxis, and preventative strategies, Petrosian, aka \"Iron Tigran\", exhibited unparalleled consistency and resourcefulness, making him notoriously difficult to defeat.\nThis course delves into the world of Petrosian, highlighting his unique playstyle and extraordinary contributions to chess. Reputed as the 'first defender with a capital D' by Vladimir Kramnik, Petrosian's style has left a deep imprint on generations of players. Despite his affinity for draws, his exciting victories showcase a meticulously calculated and risk-free style, offering a refreshing approach to the game.\nWe carefully curate the most riveting victories from Petrosian's career, showcasing how the chessboard can be a place of logic and control, rather than luck and chance. Inspired by Nimzovich and Capablanca, Petrosian's style underlines the power of gradual advantage accumulation, reducing unnecessary risks, and maintaining control.\nPetrosian's legacy goes beyond his lifetime, with his triumphs celebrated in numerous memorial tournaments worldwide. His extraordinary achievements include his victories in two World Championship matches against Botwinnik and Spassky, four Soviet Championship titles, match wins against notable players like Kasparov, Fischer, Karpov, and an impressive overall performance in Olympiad play.\nThis course prioritizes Petrosian's shorter wins and essential games to offer you a comprehensive understanding of his depth and positional wisdom. Join us in this journey to uncover the secrets of Petrosian's resilient and strategic play, and learn to imbue your games with a touch of 'Iron Tigran' brilliance.",

      "description": "Welcome to Your Chess Endgame Journey!\nI’m super excited to guide you through the fascinating world of chess endgames.\nWhy Endgames Matter More Than You Think\nMany people think of endgames as boring or just a necessary evil. But in reality, endgames are crucial—and I’ve designed this course to make learning them both fun and practical. I’ve carefully selected only the essential concepts that beginners really need to know.\nInterestingly, many beginners don’t even reach the endgame phase in their games. But those who do often struggle—missing chances to win clearly winning positions or failing to hold draws in drawn positions. This course aims to help you avoid those common mistakes.\nMeet Your Instructor\nI’m a FIDE-rated player with several years of experience teaching beginners. I’ve created multiple Udemy courses tailored for new players, and this course draws on that experience to focus on what works best for learners at the start of their chess journey.\nWhat This Course Will Do for You\nWill mastering these endgame techniques skyrocket your rating? Probably not overnight. But the solid foundation you’ll build here will help you maintain and steadily improve your rating. Like any skill, chess improves with a balance of theory and practice—so the more you play and apply what you learn here, the stronger you’ll become.\nWhat Others Are Saying\nVedant Goswami (2300+ rated coach and player) — \"Good ending material for beginners\"\nSaurav Kumar Karn — \"Simplified way of teaching. It was great. Thank you.\"\nVijay Kumar — \"Good\"",

You’ll know exactly what pawn structures will occur, where your pieces will go, what pieces to exchange, and most importantly where and when to launch your game-winning attack!\nInstead of analyzing everything over-the-board, as your opponents will do, you’ll use your home preparation to get a serious edge both on the clock and on the board!\nWho is this course for?\nThe course is designed with 1500-2200 rated players in mind. The “ideal student” is a club level player who wants to add a powerful, yet “low-theory” weapon against 1.e4 in his repertoire, sufficient for outplaying 2300 rated players.\nThe course covers all the most popular responses by white including the Modern Variation, Knight Variation, and the Maroczy Bind.

Every game is analyzed from start to finish, showing you exactly how to gain the advantage in the opening, dominate in the middlegame, and convert wins in the endgame.\nWhat You’ll Learn (and Why It Gives You an Unfair Advantage)\nChess Openings That Win Games – Stop playing passive setups and start using opening strategies that put immediate pressure on your opponent.\nMiddlegame Mastery – Learn how to create strong positional play, set traps, and dictate the pace of the game against even the toughest opponents.\nGrandmaster-Level Endgames – Most players fail in the endgame. You’ll learn how to convert small advantages into unstoppable victories.\nTactical Precision & Killer Instinct – Recognize winning tactics before your opponent sees them, calculate deep, and execute with confidence.\nStrategic Thinking & Game Theory – Go beyond basic principles and understand the real reasons behind every Grandmaster move.\nPattern Recognition & Faster Decision-Making – Learn how top players instantly spot key ideas and make strong moves under time pressure.\nPsychological Warfare in Chess – Make your opponents uncomfortable, force them into mistakes, and take control of the game on a mental level.\nWhy Most Players Stay Stuck—And How You Can Break Free\nThe reason most players struggle to improve is not because they lack talent. It’s because they study chess the wrong way—watching random games, memorizing moves without understanding them, and hoping to \"just get better\" over time.\nThat doesn’t work.\nThe players who actually improve are the ones who learn from real high-level games, break down each move, and train their minds to think like a Grandmaster. That’s exactly what this course does.\nWhat Makes This Course Different?\nReal Grandmaster Games, Not Theoretical Concepts – You’ll see actual, hard-fought games where I beat top players, not just abstract ideas.\nMove-by-Move Explanations – Every single move is broken down so you understand why it was played and how to apply the same ideas in your own games.\nPractical Strategies That Work at Any Level – Whether you're an intermediate or advanced player, these ideas will immediately strengthen your game.\nA Complete Chess Training System – Openings, middlegame play, and endgames—every phase is covered in-depth.\nHere’s the Truth: If You Don’t Learn These Strategies, Your Opponents Will\nEvery serious chess player is looking for an edge.

In this unique training, you will be presented with various tournament situations and tasked with making decisions within a strict 30-second time frame, mirroring the time constraints of real tournaments. Over a hundred complex hands will be presented for your analysis, providing an invaluable learning experience.\nRenowned poker coach Alexander Fitzgerald will guide you through each question, offering detailed explanations of why certain responses are correct or incorrect. Drawing on his expertise, he will help you understand the intricacies of tournament poker and sharpen your decision-making skills.\nThis video course will cover different aspects of Tournament Poker, emphasizing the need to adjust your strategy based on your opponents' tendencies. Through the analysis of over 20 million hands, we have identified patterns and tendencies in the field that can be leveraged to your advantage. Exploiting these tendencies will enable you to elicit more folds when you don't have a strong hand and accumulate more chips when you do.\nWhen faced with the question of GTO (Game Theory Optimal) or Exploit, the answer is clear: Exploit! Imagine playing a game of rock-paper-scissors with a child who consistently chooses scissors 8 out of 10 times. Instead of striving for balance and selecting different options at varying frequencies, why not choose rock every single time and secure a win in 8 out of 10 instances? Alex will teach you how to effectively exploit the field and achieve success.\nThis demanding approach, which has proven highly effective for Alexander Fitzgerald's 2,000+ students, is now frequently used as a warm-up routine in 15-minute increments before playing.\nPrepare to enhance your tournament poker skills and develop a competitive edge.

      "description": "El Sistema Londres es un esquema de apertura que tiene fama de sólido pero que encierra mucho más veneno del que aparenta. Recientemente, ha alcanzado gran popularidad porque el propio Campeón del Mundo, Magnus Carlsen, lo utiliza con asiduidad y ha demostrado que se puede ganar con este sistema incluso a los Maestros de la élite.\nUna de las grandes ventajas del Sistema Londres es que no es necesario el estudio de mucha teoría ya que, debido a la naturaleza de esta apertura, es mucho más importante entender las ideas y los planes que surgen detrás de cada posición que aprender de memoria un sinfín de líneas teóricas.\nAdemás, el Sistema Londres es un sistema de apertura universal que puede ser empleado contra casi cualquier respuesta y defensa elegida por las negras. Esta característica permite al jugador ahorrar mucho tiempo en su estudio de las aperturas, ya que puede confiar en utilizar este sistema para casi todo. Es un sistema fácil de aprender, y que lleva a posiciones muy sólidas pero no exentas de posibilidades tácticas y combinativas. De hecho, es una apertura en la que suelen producirse pocos cambios de piezas, lo que lleva a posiciones de medio juego muy ricas estratégicamente, que permiten jugar a ganar desde las primeras jugadas. El jugador que entienda mejor las posiciones que surgen en el medio juego se encontrará en ventaja y tendrá todas las posibilidades para ganar la partida.\nEn este curso se estudian las ideas generales detrás del Sistema Londres, celadas, trucos tácticos y planes típicos enfocados especialmente en la variante clásica con un rápido ...e6 por parte de las negras. Aprenderás a manejarte en posiciones de medio juego y finales que surgen a partir de este sistema de apertura.\nNo solamente aprenderás aperturas, sino que también aprenderás estrategia, mejorarás tu visión táctica y combinativa y desarrollarás tu técnica en los finales de partida. Un curso muy completo con numerosos ejercicios prácticos e ilustrativas partidas magistrales completamente comentadas para que puedas llegar a dominar este sistema de apertura lleno de posibilidades, que te permitirá tener un repertorio de aperturas sólido para el resto de tu carrera ajedrecística.\nSi realmente estás buscando mejorar tu juego, este es tu curso.",

With its rising online usage and acceptance at higher levels, mastering the strategies against the Caro-Kann has become essential.\nThe Caro-Kann, seen by many as a structurally solid alternative to the French defense (1. e4 e6) sans the 'bad bishop' issue, often leads to strong endgames for black. Our course equips you to dismantle the Caro-Kann early in the game or secure a lasting advantage post the opening phase.\nThe efficiency of winning quickly in chess not only conserves energy but also provides more time for preparation - a critical advantage in tournament play, especially online 'all-you-can-eat' tournaments where rapid victories can skyrocket your rankings.\nOur course offers an in-depth exploration of numerous Caro-Kann variations from the White perspective, including:\nClassical Variation: 3...dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5\nModern aka Karpov Variation: 3...dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7\nBronstein–Larsen Variation: 5...gxf6\nKorchnoi Variation: 5...exf6\nGurgenidze Variation: 3. Nc3 g6\nAdvance Variation: 3. e5\nExchange Variation: 3. exd5 cxd5\nMain line: 4. Bd3\nPanov–Botvinnik Attack: 4. c4\nTartakower or Fantasy Variation: 3.f3\nTwo Knights Variation: 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 (or 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3)\nBy studying these tricks, traps, and quick zaps, you'll gain a deeper understanding of pawn structures in relation to king and piece placement. This will enhance your intuition for specific principles of play against the Caro-Kann, helping you gain significant advantages right from the opening.",

      "description": "The Vienna Game 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 is a Kingscrusher chess opening favorite, full of traps for the unprepared player with the Black pieces. Kingscrusher has played the Vienna Game many times, winning many online tournaments. It reduces the need to learn lots of opening theory for the Spanish game or Italian game which is what most players with black prepare against but not so much for 2. Nc3 - the Vienna Game.\nIn fact, players with Black often immediately go wrong very early with 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 exf4? which gives white a big opening advantage. Although 2. Nc3 seems fairly harmless, it can quickly turn aggressive because White has the interesting option of f4 later with some of the perks of the King's Gambit but without so much risk.\n\nOne inspiration for playing the Vienna game was when Kingscrusher personally watched Andrew Hon dismantle GM Van De Sterren at a Lloyds bank masters edition. Ever since then a curiosity was developed for this surprise opening weapon when Grandmasters are usually prepared for 2. Nf3. In fact, as of 2022, GM Paul Van De Sterren has played against 2. Nf3 115 times compared to just 7 games with 2. Nc3 shows the great surprise value, and actually White scores against him over a 42% win rate compared with 31.3% with the classical 2. Nf3. This statistical bias towards 2. Nf3 preparation leads to gaps in knowledge for very advanced players when they have to face the Vienna game.\n\nBut beginner and intermediate players also when faced with the 2. Nc3 will often be thrown off-balance mentally and completely unprepared, which can lead to quick opening disasters giving the player with the White pieces an easy quick win straight out of the opening. The use of the delayed f4 would have been impossible if 2. Nf3 had been played blocking the f4 pawn and this is a very dangerous attacking move with also a strong positional agenda of often helping White construct a strong dynamic pawn center as a basis for attacking chess later. A classic example of a disaster sequence for a completely unprepared player is the following:\n\n\n1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 exf4 4. e5 Qe7 5. Qe2 Ng8 6. d4 d6 7. Nd5 Qd8 8.\nNxc7+ Qxc7 9. exd6+ and black can resign\n\nThere are many pitfalls and traps that Black can fall into and this is just one example.\nAnother inspiration for the Vienna Game was in the classic book \"Play Better Chess\" by Leonard Barden who is a very strong British player. This is one of Kingscrusher's favorite chess books and the Vienna game - especially the \"Vienna Gambit\" is emphasized as a great practical opening weapon, especially for tournament players who need to rack up points for prizes - a \"proven points scorer\".\nThere are some very dangerous ideas involving an early f4 which makes use of the upside of not having committed a Knight to f3 which is the usually taught move for everyone after 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3\nThe different ways of playing the Vienna game are explored ranging from a safer King's Gambit style with f4 to more positional ways with fianchetto the King's bishop to g2.\nTranspositions to the King's Gambit or Three Knights opening are not the central focus of this course and will not be discussed except in intro videos in order to achieve maximum focus on Vienna Game core variations and ideas.",

Um dos motivos é o fato de aprendermos mais sobre peão rei (1.e4) no início da jornada do xadrez.\nA ideia desse curso é montar um repertório completo contra as linhas principais do peão dama (1.d4 e 2.c4), utilizando a dinâmica defesa Grunfeld. Hoje em dia, os sistemas para as brancas são muito populares, por isso vários capítulos serão dedicados a enfrentar esses sistemas, sendo o Sistema London o mais utilizado entre estes.\nA defesa Grunfeld tem vários objetivos, mas o principal é buscar uma iniciativa logo na fase inicial do jogo, e não deixar o seu adversário de brancas ter um jogo fácil. Assim como nos outros cursos que fiz na Udemy, teremos exemplos de partidas desde os níveis mais iniciais para entender quais as respostas mais comuns das brancas contra esse repertório sugerido.\nAlém dos vídeos, o aluno vai ter acesso ao material de apoio, onde analiso com mais detalhes e maior profundidade as variantes mencionadas.

The Englund Gambit is an aggressive attack that can gain a positional and material advantage over the opponent if played correctly. The gambit starts with white playing Queen's Pawn Opening and many times king pawn. Many chess players may have heard of the Englund Gambit and may have even seen the move order but I can guarantee you that not many players seen the move order that Maurice Bishop teaches. The move order and the way Maurice Bishop plays the Englund Gambit is flawless. He's won many OTB chess tournaments using this opening; as well as many online chess games using this opening and even defeating a National Master live on chess dot com with this opening. This opening is so sneaky that even the strongest players can even fall for it's many traps. This dynamic opening is easy to remember and doesn't have any theory. The 3 keys in learning this opening is developing your pieces as fast as possible, castling queenside as fast as possible, and attacking your opponent as fast as possible. The Englund Gambit is an exciting and fun opening and believe anyone will love the results it gives.  If you want to stomp your many opponents in chess then this video course is for you.",

We track progress with aim assessment routines, and flicking speed and first shot accuracy increasing by 15% in first week.\n\n\nFew cases:\n- Gold 1 to Plat 1 in 1 week after using methodics of the course\n- Gold 3: 100bots in 127 seconds => 107 seconds in 6 days\n- Diamond 3 to Immortal 2 - player that relied too much on his high IQ strats, after fixing his mechanics\nYou'll get framework for improving raw aim in Valorant.\nI've analysed hundreds of aiming tutorials from best aiming experts during these 2,5 years. All of them might bring you some results, but the thing that only few practice drills have best Result/Effort ratio. Students see first improvements after 1st session.

Je vous conseille aussi de n'essayer qu'un seul move à la fois pour chaque nouveau tournoi dans lequel vous vous exercerez sinon vous risquez de déstabiliser votre jeu. Par exemple, vous essayerez vos nouvelles connaissances sur le c-bet dans un MTT, puis dans un autre MTT vous ferez le focus sur le double barrel.\nLe poker est un processus d'amélioration continue sans relâche : de nouvelles notions sont découvertes chaque année et les joueurs progressent sans arret par le travail. Grâce à ce cours, vous trouverez vos propres leaks pour chaque coup et vous verrez comment les corriger en comprenant la raison et l'opportunité de chaque move.\nNe laissez aucune chance au hasard !

      "description": "Updated up to FM24! - This is the course for (potential) players of Football Manager, the famous and one and only game where you have absolute power over your favorite football club! The course, created by a very experienced and successful manager, shows you the way from buying and installing the game (get the cheapest Steam code for your area!), to setting it up, to becoming a very successful player of the game.\nThe course is based on FM20 but has textual updates up to FM24. The course is also very useful for gamers who use versions earlier than FM20 and will be useful for FM25 and over. Do you still have questions or need some help after you've finished the course? No problem - just reach out and I'll answer all of your questions personally!\n\nWhat do you get?\nThe course contains over 4 hours of video material, divided into 36 short videos. You can skip anything you don't want to watch. Or re-watch videos. There are a few quizzes you can take (never mandatory) to sharpen/test your knowledge after watching a video. And, last but not least, you'll get 5 very valuable and unique guides (downloadable in PDF) about staff, player personalities, player traits, tactics, and match shouts!\nSo: that is a lot of value! Check out all the video titles below to see what we will discuss.\nIs this the course for you?\nThe game is great but extremely comprehensive; there is a lot you have to know and do, to become a moderately successful manager. This course provides you with the tools to become more than that. You can become a great manager: a Master Manager! It is created for people who have never played the game but want to kick-start their FM career. It's also a great course for people who struggled to understand the game and couldn't become a successful manager, for whatever reason. Even if you're a fairly experienced player: there are a lot of tips and tricks you can take from this course for sure. You will only see screencast videos of the game; so it's also a fun way of learning.\nPlease like, share (and all that...) Master Manager social media; Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter/X: @MasterManagerFM\n\n\nUpdate for FM24\nUnder video 14 (Tactic building) you’ll find an explanation about a new player role, an improved player role, and the way roles work together when creating a tactic.\nCheck the text at video 8 (Hiring and Firing staff), 28 (Set pieces attacking), or 29 (Set pieces defending) to learn more about a newly added staff role.\nUnder videos 32 (Buying players) and 16 (Selling/loaning out), you will find additional information regarding the overhaul in transfers in FM24.\nUpdate for FM23\nUnder videos 21 (Contract negotiations) and 31 (Buying players), you’ll read about the more important role of agents in the game.\nUnder video 18 (Scouting assignments) you’ll find a short text about a new way of scouting. Under video 7 (Getting to know your new club & in-game settings) you’ll find information about changes in the supporter profile of your club.\nUpdate for FM22\nUnder videos 7 (Getting to know your new club & in-game settings), 8 (Hiring and Firing staff), 14 (Tactic building), and 17 (Finding players), you'll find short notes on that topic - referring to new features and things to take into account. It could also be helpful to check the notes regarding FM21 if you haven't played that game.\nUpdate for FM21\nUnder videos 8 (Hiring and Firing staff), 13 (Player Traits), 17 (Finding players), and 18 (Scouting assignments), you'll find short notes on that topic - referring to new features and things to take into account.\nIn general: please note that in FM21 the way you talk to people (individually or in press conferences) has been changed. Instead of selecting things like 'calm' or 'assertive', you're able to put an arm around a player or look at attending journalists with a 'warm smile'. You can hover over your options to learn more about what you are actually doing. I found that common sense goes a long way. Think about what you want to achieve and act appropriately.",

O mesmo acontece em partidas pensadas, onde mesmo com um tempo maior para calcular, acabamos não enxergando as linhas vencedoras simplesmente por não saber calcular da maneira correta.\nO curso está estruturado didaticamente em módulo divididos por níveis, de modo a abranger todos os enxadristas abaixo de 1900.\nTodas as aulas são no formato Teoria e Prática com resolução de exercícios táticos comentados\nNo primeiro módulo, você aprenderá a como pensar da maneira correta exercícios táticos mais elementares. A ideia aqui é que o jogador iniciante possa evoluir de uma maneira significativa simplesmente aplicando o passo a passo que eu vou ensinar. É recomendado que jogadores de todos os níveis assistam a essas aulas, pois o passo a passo que iremos aprender, será utilizado em todos os demais módulos\nNo segundo módulo, veremos situações táticas mais complexas, que é onde o jogador intermediário de xadrez (~1400 a 1700) sente que está \"travado\" e não consegue encontrar as soluções sem a ajuda do computador. Aqui trabalharemos ainda mais a visão combinatória de modo a destravar a sua capacidade de imaginar os lances a frente.\nJá no terceiro módulo, é aqui que você aprenderá a como desenvolver o feeling que todo grande jogador possuí para saber quando sacrificar, quando fazer um lance de preparação e quando tomar a atitude mais simples dentro do tabuleiro.\nAo final deste curso você com certeza terá o know-how necessário para evoluir a sua agilidade de raciocínio na visão combinatória, além de uma expansão significativa da sua capacidade de calculo de variantes.\nNão perca essa oportunidade de dar um grande upgrade em seu nível enxadrístico ! Afinal, como disse o célebre Grande Mestre Viktor Korchnoi: \"O xadrez é 99 % tática.\"",

As an extra job I am making premade servers that I sell online and I am a freelancer on multiple Services Teams. In this course, I will also teach the students how to make money off of Minecraft servers and how you guys can become a freelancer yourself. Also, all the students who attend this course will get access to the server that we will be making. This way you will have a premade server that you can use for personal use or you could use this to copy and paste some stuff for your server. Please notice that you will only receive the free plugins within the setup. I will not include any paid plugins. If you want to get the newest updates on the setup as well feel free to message me and then I will let you know how to get life-time access to the setup including all updates.\nIf you got any questions before buying this course feel free message me via the site or via discord (ItzMehMaikel#0583)!",

You will also require patience and awareness! No carry hero begins a game of DotA 2 readily strong - quite the contrary! - so picking your fights strategically is of the utmost importance.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nKnow whether you are ready to help your team fight, or avoid conflict in search of more gold\nMaster creep pulls in the safe lane to deny the enemy offlaner precious farm\nKnow when split-pushing is your best option\nCrush your enemies in decisive late-game team fights\nCarry heroes come in many forms, and all have a massive impact in the late-game. Clinkz is a hyper-aggressive carry hero with an emphasis on rushing around the map on a constant hunt for lone enemies to slay. Medusa is the opposite, favoring extremely slow games which give her time to farm the items needed to become one of the hardest carrys in the game. Some carry heroes excel at rampaging through enemy towers while others are natural fighters.\nYour instructor in this course is player and coach, SMD, author of hundreds of DotA 2 guides on GameLeap. SMD has been an authority in the carry role for years, and now brings his experience and knowledge to this course to jump-start your journey as an effective carry player.\nIn many games, your actions alone will clinch victory or incite the sting of defeat. Will you carry or throw?",

Dans ma précédente formation : \"Premiers pas en tactique\", le deuxième volet de \"Progresser aux échecs\" nous avons vu les différentes combinaisons tactiques. Cependant, il est possible de gagner d'une autre manière, en étouffant l'adversaire petit à petit à l'aide de principes stratégiques. Dans cette formation, je vous présente une série de principes stratégiques pouvant être réalisés en cours de partie, lorsqu’il reste encore beaucoup de pièces sur l’échiquier.\nCette formation est GRATUITE !\nElle est RAPIDE ! En seulement 1 heure (10 vidéos), vous aurez assimilé les premiers grands principes stratégiques aux échecs.\nElle est EFFICACE ! Le style est dynamique, avec de nombreuses exemples pédagogiques qui permettent de retenir aisément les différentes stratégies de base expliquées.\nElle est LUDIQUE ! La formation dispose de 100 QCM, avec des questions théoriques et des exercices pratiques, qui vous permettent de vous évaluer au fur et à mesure.\nLes exemples et exercices de cette formation sont extraits de livre d’échecs reconnus dans ce domaine, ainsi que de parties que j'ai jouées moi-même.\nJe vous donne aussi de nombreux conseils pratiques, venant de mon expérience de joueur de club.\nJ’espère que le contenu proposé vous aidera,\nGuillaume ROBINE\n\n\nEnregistrement audio réalisé à l’aide d’un Micro Blue Yeti\nEnregistrement vidéo depuis ChessBase 14\nMontage audio sur Adobe Audition 2021\nMontage vidéo sur Sony Vegas Pro 18.0",

      "description": "Journey through the legendary games of Emanuel Lasker, the German chess genius who reigned supreme as World Chess Champion for an unparalleled 27 years (1894-1921). A mathematician and philosopher, Lasker's innovative strategies and tactics laid the groundwork for modern chess.\nThis course, meticulously curated by Kingscrusher, focuses on Lasker's most instructive games from 1889 to 1899, a period that witnessed his meteoric rise to the pinnacle of global chess. Kingscrusher's expert analyses of Lasker's games provide unique insights, revealing Lasker's groundbreaking approach to chess as a dynamic, multi-dimensional battle rather than a rigid game of set principles.\nWitness the clarity of Lasker's ideas and marvel at his mastery over intricate chess maneuvers, tactics, and strategies. His profound influence extends to grandmasters of later generations, including chess luminaries like Mikhail Tal and Vladimir Kramnik. Kramnik, in fact, has praised Lasker for discovering 'global' chess, where various positional elements interact and balance each other out, a stark contrast to the more one-dimensional strategies of his predecessor, Steinitz.\nThe course also highlights Lasker's remarkable accuracy even in simultaneous exhibitions, with many of his moves standing the test against modern, high-tech engines like Stockfish. Uncover the rich essence of Lasker's chess philosophy, which emphasizes the game as a 'fight' and incorporates psychological insights about the opponent into the game plan, aligning with timeless strategies outlined in Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War'.\nDelve into Lasker's pivotal matches against Steinitz, revealing his smart strategy to draw Steinitz into less familiar, queenless positions, leading to his spectacular victories. This course illuminates how Lasker's pursuit of credibility, coupled with his exceptional skills, made him one of the most respected World Chess Champions.\nJoin Kingscrusher on this fascinating exploration of Lasker's games and brace yourself for a treasure trove of chess wisdom and inspiration. Whether you're a beginner, an amateur, or an aspiring grandmaster, you'll find invaluable lessons and insights in every move of these timeless masterpieces.",

Apart from information, you need to train and acquire necessary practical skills. This is true just as much for chess.\nThat is why, in these seminars, GM Smirnov provides you with a very small user’s manual that has several items you can follow, one by one, to understand chess clearly.\nCourse Content:\nThe seminar covers four major lectures with practical suggestion. In each lecture, GM Igor Smirnov answers all students' questions and provides additional tips to implement in their games.\n1. Time to Win\n2. Right thinking in chess\n3. Smirnov Gambit\n4. Art of Planning\nThe course contains around 100 minutes of video lessons and a PDF summery for every seminar topic.\n\n\nIgor is the founder of the “Remote Chess Academy\" company that has helped thousands of students worldwide to improve their chess results.\nGM Smirnov has developed lots of chess video lessons, articles, webinars and training courses, including the famous courses “The Grandmaster's Secrets\", “The Grandmaster's Positional Understanding\", and “Calculate Till Mate\".",

      "description": "Chess is a game of decision-making, and as the famous saying by Philidor goes, 'Pawns are the soul of chess.' Unlike any other pieces, pawns are the symbol of irreversible choices, moves you make that could shape your entire game. This is why understanding chess pawn structures is a fundamental skill for any player.\n' The Ultimate Guide to Chess Pawn Structures' provides a comprehensive study on pawn structures in chess. This course focuses on pivotal games from World Chess Champions and renowned 'structuralists' who have shown an exemplary understanding of pawn structures and have tailored their opening choices to exploit these structures effectively.\nThe aim of this course is to provide a balanced understanding of different structures, highlighting their pros and cons, and to guide you in predicting your opponent's moves and plans. The examples and templates in this course will enhance your understanding of openings, allowing you to employ successful plans from past world chess champions, grandmasters, and other great players.\nThis course explores key pawn structural elements through a plethora of instructive games, showcasing the advantages and disadvantages of:\nDoubled Pawns\nHanging Pawns\nBackward Pawns\nIsolated Pawns\nPawn Islands\nPassed Pawns\nThorn Pawns (inspired by Neural Networks)\nIt also delves into more specific configurations of pawns, including:\nd5 Pawn Chain\ne5 Pawn Chain\nCarlsbad Structure\nCaro Structure\nSlav Structure\nBoleslavsky Hole Structure (with special emphasis on Sveshnikov examples!)\nStonewall Structure\nAt the end of this course, you will develop a 'structuralist' mindset towards chess, recognizing the true importance of the 'little guys,' the pawns! As Philidor asserted, pawns are indeed the life and soul of the game. So, buckle up and delve deep into the intricacies of chess pawn structures with this comprehensive guide.",

MOBA是一款推塔游戏! 掌握兵线的人，掌控整场游戏!\n兵线的重要性。你家野区变成我家后院的关键。清兵速度是一项非常重要的影藏能力\n7.打团意识篇\n你清楚你自己的目标是谁吗? 看到人就打难怪上不了王者! 先搞清楚你玩的是什麽位置、任务是什麽\n每个位置的定位。打人的顺序大大影响团战的结果。团战站位如何站\n8.经济篇\n没有经济你打什麽输出? 有钱真的可以任性! 成为王者荣耀第一经济学家\n经济来源到底在哪里。有钱打没钱，就是爸爸打儿子。速刷打钱致富大法，全场最高经济教学\n9.打野篇\n全队经济的核心支柱。打野英雄介绍篇。顺翻还被翻盘，90%打野的锅\n野核与蓝领打野的差异。刺客型打野。战士型打野\n10.上单篇\n稳住军心的强力战士。上单英雄介绍篇。边路战士是带兵线的关键人物\n边路战士的职责所在。战士型边路。坦克型边路\n11.射手篇\n全队输出的最大来源。射手英雄介绍篇。没有射手参与的团战=输出减半\n边路射手的职责所在。有位移射手。无位移射手\n12.中路篇\n全图支援游走第一人。法师英雄介绍篇。只会黏在中路不游走的法师不是好法师\n法师的职责所在。大法师类型。法刺类型。炮台型法师类型\n13.辅助篇\n队伍团战的核心人物。辅助英雄介绍篇。团队增益，保护后排，开团通通来\n辅助的职责所在。肉辅类型。软辅类型\n14.总结篇\n职业战队训练系统。自主实力提升训练计划。职业选手都在用的训练方式\n一个月的时间实力提升20%以上。无需任何教学，自主就能提升实力。属于自己的训练计划制定\n15.KPL职业赛常见三大基本体系阵容\n16.阵地战阵容解析、搭配示范及英雄定位分析\n17.poke容解析、搭配示范及英雄定位分析\n18.突脸阵容解析、搭配示范及英雄定位分析\n19.排位如何应用阵容体系做BP\n我们对教学有信心，也同时希望你准备好，认真投入这个教学，而不是嘴上说说，一天捕鱼三天晒网。\n任何成就都需要时间来累积，把游戏打好也是一样的，正所谓师父引进门，修行在个人，我们用心教学，你也愿意用心学，上王者这件事情是可以被系统化训练克服的，愿祝所有召唤师可以顺利上分，每日排位十连胜。\n\nQ1.为什么需要系统化教学?\n确保每一个人都可以在0基础的条件下学会！一课一练，教学外加训练作业!不能实战的教学等于废话!搭配课堂签到与每一课的作业布置，从理论到实操全部包办！\n今天你把基础观念全部打通了，你玩什麽英雄，大方向概念都是不会错的，无论你想玩自己的信仰英雄，还是针对团队选出最合适的英雄，教你扎实的提高胜率，稳定上分，这才是竞及的目的。\nQ2.免费的教程网上一大堆，为什么我要付费学习?\n记住，免费的永远都是最贵的!我相信，如果你是有恒心且有毅力之人，如果你愿意花时间上网花时间多找一些资料和攻略，肯定也可以靠自己上王者，我当初也是这样走过来的。是这就是一个时间成本的问题，万一你没有时间呢?\n找攻略哪里找？别人教得就一定是对的？别人教得东西就一定适合我？网路上免费的教学，最大的目的就是引流、有人气，真的每一个人都会毫无保留的全部教给你吗？如果不留一手，粉丝全部免费学完就拍拍屁鼓走人，这些主播、up主要还会有人气？最重的是，为什么别人要花自己的时间，毫无保留的免费教你他的宝贵经验与知识呢？\n如果你能看懂我以上这些问句就能理解，免费的永远都是最贵的，你失去的可能是你宝贵的时间，我收这个学费也是为了确保，你不会学三天就放弃了，如果我都做成免费教学，相信我，大家也不会珍惜当做一回事。\n课程收费，代表我需要为我的课程负责，如果你真的想上王者，只是苦于没有一位伯乐指导，给我一次机会，我对你的教学肯定是用尽全力！\nQ3.你选择买代打还是教学?\n我们教你有能力自己单排打上王者。可能你在淘宝上看过同行的教学，收费至少是我们的２倍多！他们的游戏实力确实很强，都是1800分以上的高手。但是，这又关你什么事情呢?自己会玩，不代表会教学!找一个高手跟你一对一匹配，看你玩、陪你玩，简单来说就是看到什么说什么，不存在什么系统化教学的。\n讲直接一点，学完还是打不上去，他们就用课堂时间陪你双排打上去就好。你买不是真教学，你只是买陪玩顺便陪你聊天讲几句的服务。\n我们卖的不是陪玩，卖的是游戏教学，我敢给你教学成果的满意保证，你觉得他们会给你不上王者就退费的承诺吗？下一个赛季又重新更新之后，你还要再买一次他们的教学服务，每个赛季都重复消费吗？\n如果教学做不到，学完之后永远受用，真真实实靠自己的实力打上王者一次，那我觉得没有意义，我教你的是这套游戏的基础逻辑，只要你通了这些观念，每赛季重新打上王者就是时间问题，我只要你学１次，就可以解决每赛季都要上王者的问题。欢迎大家可以去淘宝买同行的服务再来和我们比较，真金不怕火炼，对于游戏教学我们有100%的信心不怕比较!",

I want to help you understand how I approach the game, and to break down every part of what makes a great Overwatch 2 player: positioning, aim, resource management, hero pool, strategy, matchups, communication, awareness, etc. By breaking the game down into manageable pieces, you can target your weaknesses and improve consistently over time.\n\n\nThe core content of the course (intended for all students) is about 6.5 hours in total. The remaining 40+ are split up into hero specific matchup guides. My intention is that students only spend time watching the guides relevant to the heroes you choose to play. Estimated total time: 10-15 hours.\n\n\nThere are many helpful tips in the course, but it's real goal is to increase your rate of improvement rather than give you patch-specific advice about the strongest heroes or the best strategies for pro-players at a given moment. We'll go over everything from in-game settings to the best ways to manage a budding professional career.\n\n\nWhile you won't often see ideal team comps at most ranks, we will discuss in detail how you can still maximize your chances to win. To rank up you don't need to win every game, you just need to tip the scales slightly in each match. If you want to become a better Overwatch 2 player, this course will help you achieve it.",

      "description": "Welcome to this complete, fun and easy 1.e4 Chess Opening repertoire course, carefully designed for beginners and improvers rated 0–1600.\nWhether you're a complete beginner or a club-level player seeking clarity and confidence in your games, this course gives you a full, easy-to-learn 1.e4 system that can be used against all of Black's common replies.\nThe legendary Bobby Fischer once declared, \"1.e4—Best by test,\" and in this course, we embrace that philosophy fully. But we don’t stop at just playing 1.e4. This course equips you with tailored, principled, and aggressive options against the most statistically likely defenses you're likely to face across real-world games. Every line has been chosen to punish common errors, deliver easy plans, and offer a powerful blend of traps, tactics, and thematic strategies.\nWhy This Course Is Unique and Valuable\nMany beginners and intermediate players get lost in complex opening theory or rigid system setups that don’t respond dynamically to what the opponent plays. This course avoids both extremes. Instead, it gives you:\nA complete and reactive repertoire starting from 1.e4\nEngine-checked lines that encourage Black to go wrong\nReal-game model examples to anchor every concept\nStatistically informed choices based on what you’re most likely to face\nExplanations of why each variation was chosen and what was deliberately left out\nYou won’t just learn moves. You’ll learn how to play with purpose and punish imprecision.\nWhat You Will Learn\nAbility to confidently play 1.e4 with a full, structured repertoire\nAbility to punish common mistakes in the Scotch Game\nAbility to handle the Philidor Defence with central pressure and tactics\nAbility to exploit early inaccuracies in the Petrov Defence\nAbility to avoid mainline overload and still play principled, aggressive chess\nAbility to apply key opening principles: development, central control, king safety\nAbility to apply development with purpose in every variation\nAbility to exploit delayed castling and uncoordinated development\nAbility to handle the Sicilian Defence with the Grand Prix Attack\nAbility to respond powerfully to the Scandinavian Defence with the BDG\nAbility to play the Fantasy Variation against the Caro-Kann Defence\nAbility to use the Reti Gambit against the French Defence\nAbility to transition smoothly from opening to middlegame\nAbility to simplify into better endgames from strong openings\nAbility to recognize and exploit thematic pawn breaks\nAnd much more across 60 \"ability to\" outcomes, structured around every major reply to 1.e4.\nWhat Makes the Repertoire Practical and Effective\nThis isn’t a memorization-heavy course. It’s built around understanding and pattern recognition. Every section starts with a statistical analysis of what you’re most likely to face, followed by:\nThematic breakdowns\nEarly traps that actually work\nSolid but aggressive lines\nEmphasis on natural development, center control, and king safety\nWe explore how to develop with threats, create central imbalances, and press early advantages when opponents neglect core principles. This makes the course especially valuable in online blitz and rapid formats, where most games are decided by poor openings and midgame blunders.\nCoverage of All Major Black Defenses\nThis course includes dedicated sections on:\nDouble King Pawn: Scotch Game, Philidor, Petrov\nSicilian Defence: Grand Prix-style setup\nScandinavian Defence: Blackmar-Diemer Gambit lines\nFrench Defence: 2.b3 and the Reti Gambit (Accepted and Declined)\nCaro-Kann Defence: Fantasy Variation\nPirc Defence and Modern Defence: Austrian-style responses with f4\nRare and offbeat systems: Alekhine, Nimzowitsch, Owen’s, St. George’s, etc.\nEach section contains a mix of model games, common tactical themes, opponent mistakes, and clean ways to gain early advantages or reach better endgames.\nPrincipled, Not Dogmatic\nYou’ll be guided by strong opening principles but never bound to rigid systems. This is not a \"system opening\" course like the London or Colle. Instead, you get tailored responses that aim to exploit the downsides of each Black move.\nIn doing so, we avoid the trap of passively waiting for a middlegame. This repertoire is designed to press early, seize the initiative, and create problems for the opponent from move one.\nLearning Through Model Games\nModel games form the beating heart of this course. You won't just be fed theory. You’ll see the ideas in action.\nFrom Paul Morphy to Stockfish to modern blitz players, each model game reinforces the course principles. You'll watch how early development, purposeful threats, and clean central control lead to practical wins or overwhelming positions.\nFor Whom This Course Is Designed\nBeginners and club players (0–1600) who want a strong yet learnable White repertoire\nPlayers who are tired of memorizing long theory and want to understand ideas\nThose returning to chess and feeling overwhelmed by the volume of opening options\nLearners who enjoy real-game learning and want to recognize patterns, traps, and principles\nAnyone who wants to build confidence with 1.e4 and become dangerous in the opening phase\nWhat Are the Requirements?\nYou should know the basic rules of chess, including how pieces move and how to checkmate\nNo prior opening knowledge needed – this is beginner-friendly and grows with you\nA desire to improve with a repertoire that combines theory, traps, and understanding\nA device to watch the video lectures and ideally an online board to test ideas\nPhilosophy and Commitment\nThis course has been crafted with care, backed by real statistical research, practical testing, and teaching experience. I’m committed to evolving this repertoire as needed and regularly adding insights that help you make the most of your time at the board.\nOnce you've gone through a few lectures, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could leave a review. It helps me improve the course and helps others take their first step in mastering 1.e4.\nThank you for joining me on this journey — let’s build your repertoire together and start winning from the very first move.\nBest wishes,\nTryfon Gavriel (Kingscrusher)",
