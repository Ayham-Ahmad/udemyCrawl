Time just flew by and they have no clue how little they accomplished that week.  Worse yet, that month.  And yet, the rent is still due in a few days, as is the car payment, heat, hydro, taxes, insurance policies (life and car), and the little beads of sweat on your forehead aren't because you've been exercising.\nLet me help.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to manage your time better.  That's it.  Time is the only asset you have and if you abuse it, it's going to cost you.  If you control your time, you have more time to sell and that means you'll earn more.  It's really that simple.\nSo if you want to sell more, earn more money AND take pride in what you do, this is indeed the right place for you to be.",

But you may find that you always feel like there is more to accomplish, no matter how much you do.\nThis is because you’re likely splitting up your focus on too many different things at once. Getting better at managing your time will allow you to work in a more intelligent manner, rather than harder. This will allow you to get more goals achieved in less time, and who doesn’t want that?\nTime management is all about the way you plan your day, organize your focus, and decide which activities to place your attention on. Though it seems almost silly to learn about time management instead of using your time to work, you will discover that it pays off.\n\n\nWho should take is course?\nWhether you are a manager, team worker, entrepreneur, office worker, business owner, product manager, agile product manager, scrum master coaching product owners, product owner, developer, business stakeholder or simply someone who wants to understand how tp manage your time effectively and be more productive, this is the place to start.  If you want a Personal Productivity or Time Management certification, this class is for you.\n\n\nWhat will I learn?\nIn this class you will learn:\nConcise overview of Productivity and Time Management - The exact mindset, principles and practices used by the experts to get more done in less time and get things done on time. This includes lectures on the fundamentals of Time Management and Productivity.\nThe facts based on the Experts - The proven methods used by pros such as Brian Tracy and Tony Robbins will make you an Excellent Time Manager and the most Productive human you know. Experience is essential to mastering these skills and you will learn from the pros so you know you are getting the best information in a concise format!\nCertification - Collect Your Productivity and Time Management Certificate - To get certified I teach you the foundation of Time Management and Productivity along with frequently asked questions (FAQs) and frequently misunderstood points. You will collect your Time Management and Productivity Certificate once you have understood these points and completed the course. You will also have an excellent foundation for use at work or at home\n\n\nWhat are the pre-requisites?\nThis course is video based with no supporting document necessary.  I go through key gotchas based  the pros/expert teachings in industry.\n\n\nHow is the course structured?\nIn each section you will be given an overview of a particular aspect of Personal Productivity and Effective Time Management such as Mindset, planning your day or avoiding Social Media.\nFinally, at the end of the course you can download your certificate one you have completed all the lectures. You can then  add it to your LinkedIn profile, show your employer, or use it towards your next certification should you want to go further.  You will have received an excellent foundation from this course,\nInspired by God, the Bible, my mother",

      "description": "Unlock Your Brain's True Potential\nAre you ready to sharpen your focus, enhance your memory, and elevate your mental performance to new heights? Welcome to my Optimising Brain Health for Peak Performance Course, where I’ll guide you through the six essential pillars of brain health that will unlock your brain’s peak potential.\nWhether you're a busy professional, corporate employee, business owner or a student, or simply looking to boost your cognitive abilities, this course is designed to help you achieve long-term mental clarity and resilience.\n\n\nIs Your Brain Keeping Up with Your Ambition?\nAs corporate professionals, employees and business owners, we spend so much time and energy climbing the corporate ladder, striving for success, and juggling endless responsibilities. But in the hustle and bustle of career and business life, there's one thing too many of us forget — our brain health.\nOne of my favourite quote is by Carl Jung who was a Swiss Psychiatrist. He said:\n“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”\nThis statement highlights the importance of bringing our unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviours into our conscious awareness. Carl Jung believed that much of our behaviour is driven by unconscious motives and desires and that until we become aware of these influences, we essentially live our lives on autopilot.\nThroughout my career, I’ve worked with countless driven professionals who are pushing hard to achieve their goals but, in doing so, neglect their brain health and mental wellbeing. Ignoring your brain health can lead to stress, depression, and even burnout. It’s time to change that.\nIntroducing my Optimising Brain Health for Peak Performance course, specifically designed to help busy professionals and business owners take control of their brain health, reduce stress, and reach peak mental performance without sacrificing their wellbeing.\n\n\nThe Problem Professionals and Business Owners Face\nIn a world where demands are constantly increasing, it’s easy to put brain health on the back burner. But here's the truth: when you’re not prioritising your brain health, it affects everything – your focus, productivity, emotional balance, and even your long-term career success or business.\nOver time, chronic stress, fatigue, and the pressure to perform can lead to serious issues like burnout, anxiety, and depression. And once that happens, it’s far more difficult to bounce back.\nThe solution? A proactive approach to brain health that helps you thrive in your career, business and personal life.\n\n\nWhy Focus on Brain Health?\nIn today's fast-paced world, the importance of looking after your brain health cannot be overstated. The statistics speak for themselves:\nDementia and Alzheimer’s were the leading cause of death in England and Wales in 2022, according to Alzheimer’s Research UK.\nMental health issues are having a huge economic impact, with mental health problems costing the UK economy at least £118 billion a year, as reported by the Mental Health Foundation and the London School of Economics.\nAround 1 in 6 adults in the UK are experiencing depression, a number that continues to rise as stress, pressure, and societal demands increase.\nAround 1 in 7 people in the UK are neurodivergent, highlighting the diversity of brain function and the need for tailored approaches to mental wellbeing.\nWhile these figures are taken from the UK, they reflect a Global Trend that affects individuals and societies around the world. Wherever you are, the need to prioritise your brain health is universal.\nThese numbers are a clear reminder of why taking care of your brain is so important. Prevention is key, and with the right knowledge and strategies, you can protect your mental health, improve cognitive function, and support your brain for years to come.\nYour brain is the most powerful tool you possess. It governs your thoughts, emotions, decision-making, and overall productivity. Yet, in today’s fast-paced world, we often neglect the practices that nurture and support optimal brain function.\nNeglecting your brain health could lead to cognitive decline and loss of memory leading to serious issues like Dementia and Alzheimer's.\nThat’s where the 6 Pillars of Brain Health come in. These pillars are scientifically proven strategies that will allow you to enhance your brain’s performance and protect it for years to come. When you invest in your brain health, you’re investing in your future.\n\n\nWhat you will learn?\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nUnderstand WHY looking after your Brain Health is important\nUnderstand the impacts of poor brain health for individuals, society and the economy\nUnderstand how an optimised brain can help you become more successful in your personal and professional life\nUnderstand how to incorporate brain-boosting habits into your daily life.\nUnderstand how to use the tools to reduce stress, sharpen focus, and perform at your mental peak.\nUnderstand the concept of Neurogenesis and how to use it\nUnderstand the different types of activities that will stimulate or harm our Neurogenesis\nLearn about the 6 Pillars of Brain Health for peak performance\nPractice a range of exercises to stimulate new brain cell creation\nGet a personalised blueprint and a 30 days action plan to stimulate your own Neurogenesis\n\n\nWho Is This Course For?\nBusy Professionals looking to improve their brain health, focus, decision-making, and productivity.\nStudents wanting to enhance memory retention and learning capacity.\nAnyone keen to future-proof their brain against cognitive decline and optimise their mental performance.\n\n\nKey Objectives for this course:\nCreate awareness of Brain Health and why it's important (Bring the unconscious to the conscious)\nHelp reduce the impact of poor brain health by helping you to take Action (this is key)\n\n\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nAn interest in how to improve your brain health\nWillingness to put the learning into practice (Action is key)\nNo previous knowledge about the brain is required\n\n\nReady to Invest in Your Brain?\nYour brain is your greatest asset – and it's time to give it the care and attention it deserves. So don't wait for tomorrow, delaying attention to your brain health can be detrimental - it's the gateway to your brightest future.\nJoin me on this course and take the first step towards unlocking your limitless potential. Your brain deserves the best; give it the tools to thrive today!\nEnrol today and take the first step towards a sharper, more resilient brain.",

      "description": "Qigong is a 4000+ year old practice that brings about oneness of body, mind and spirit. Though it has origins in China, techniques that used Qi (life-force energy) were practiced in India, Japan and other Asian countries as well. Over the years, these proven methods that use meditation, mindfulness, and movement, have come to be replaced by technology, medicine and religious dogmas. But since human consciousness has remained unchanged at the root, these techniques and practices are just as relevant today - if not more in this age of increased stress and detachment from nature.\nQigong results in enhanced productivity of the individual and increased harmony in teams. The habit of working with Qi puts the individual in partnership with the \"universal energy\" that surrounds us all. Which in turn manifests as higher efficiency and effectiveness. Since the physical level is the most tangible one we operate on, the effects of Qigong practice can be seen in one's health almost immediately. Ailments, whether commonplace or chronic, can be overcome with the use of energy. A greater sense of calm and peacefulness abides at the mental level. And relationships improve through the understanding of energy interplay.\nIn this course, Sandeep Nath gives participants a deep dive into the fundamentals so that they are able to connect different \"energy fads\" to tread a usable pathway contextualized for them. He also provides a Qigong workout that anyone can do every day. Coming from a corporate background himself, Sandeep speaks about \"workplace issues\" and \"productivity\" as an insider. Since he has had the benefit of learning from masters from across India, China, Tibet and Japan, he brings into this course an unmatched blend of foundational knowledge and practical application.

Now our relationship with Time, especially as managers, has reached a point where we are not satisfied anymore... always need more, running out of it... Yet Time won't change its behavior in the relationship. Therefore it is our perception, use, optimization of it that needs to shift. Shifting life-long perceptions and biases, habits is not an easy task. In this course, we will explore 4 concepts to start and engage in this mental transition, to send you on a transformative journey.\nThese concepts may challenge how you perceive time, how you perceive your job, your task prioritization. And that is OK. We need to be challenges to grow and change our perceptions and our habits.\nIn the 4 concepts mentioned above we will challenge the To Do list and migrate that to a To Achieve list, which will shift time from a Constraint to a Resource. We will challenge your perception of your role and function in your organization to support this transition. We will discuss the Important vs Urgent matrix in this new light, and we will put a few twists to the 80-20 rule and its application on Time.\nWelcome on the Journey!",

      "description": "“It’s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?” ~ Henry David Thoreau\nTime is the greatest leveler because no matter who you are and what you do, everyone has exactly 24 hours in their day.\nA big misunderstanding about “time management” is that people considering “time management” to be as some ‘add-on’ skill that they can have in addition to the core skills they use to earn a living and live their day-to-day lives. To me, time management is life management. Think about it… ! What is life anyways other than just trying to spend our time as much as possible, doing things and with people who make our life more worthwhile than some of the other things/ people.\nTo be most effective, time management works best when one has a clearly defined vision/ goals that they are trying to achieve, because that’s when you exactly know what’s the best use of your time at every moment.\nEven if you are someone who does not have a well-defined vision for yourself and take life as it comes, there are things that you are expected to accomplish in your days, weeks, months etc. and hence you are already managing your time, even if not in the most effective and efficient manner.\nA compelling vision is the first step for all transformation. Most people are unable to visualize their best selves and that’s the primary reason on why they don’t get there!\nGoal setting is discussed in all kinds of personal and professional development training programs. However, the focus primarily tends to be on ‘have’ goals, that is, people are encouraged to write down what they want to have in next 1, 5 or 10 years. For example: ‘I want to have one million dollars in my bank’ or ‘I want to have a Ferrari’. Having ‘have’ goals is fine, I am not against them. These goals are more linked to leading a comfortable life and that’s all about it!\nFulfillment or content comes from ‘be’ goals, that is, who you want to be in 1, 5 or 10 years. For example: ‘I want to be an accomplished author’ or ‘I want to be a successful businessman’. Creating ‘be’ goals is like creating a vision for you, hence you call also call it ‘visioning’.\nPeople who don’t have very well-defined long-term visions, still have short-term goals that they are trying to achieve on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Hence, even these people leverage the power of goal-setting. However, of course, they are not leveraging the full power of this transformational tool as used by people who achieve extraordinary excellence.\nImagine how much more you would achieve for yourself and your loved ones, if you could reduce time spent of things you find boring and meaninglessness and could have a vision that truly inspires you. In fact, managing their time well and setting inspiring goals is one of the key abilities that has been observed among people who become extraordinarily successful.\nThe objective of designing this course is to enable you to get quick yet lasting results. In this course, you will learn the most key principles relating to time management that I have gathered from my extensive reading and experience (300+ self-help/ personal development books over ~20 years).\nOnce you master these basic principles, you won’t need to read up any more detailed literature on time management and goal setting. A number of custom-designed exercises have also been included, which have proven effective for myself and many others around me. Ensure that you complete the exercises even if they feel uncomfortable/ tedious at first. Real lasting impact will come from doing the exercises. Once you learn how to do one full iteration of the exercises and are able to take yourself to the next level, you can repeat the entire iteration from your new normal, and continue to be on that upward trajectory, of hitting higher and higher levels.\nMastering time management will have a direct positive impact on all your life areas:\n\nPhysical (Health),\nIntellectual (Work),\nSocial (Relationships),\nFinancial (Money), and\nSpiritual (Soul),\nthereby significantly enhancing the overall quality of your life.\nWith this short introduction, I would like to invite you to join me in this transformational journey. I have done my best to ensure that this course delivers significant value to you. Despite that, for some reason, should you feel you didn’t get adequate value for your money, feel free to go for the 30-day money back.\nNow, take action, enrol in the course and change your life forever!!",

They use their limited time so productively that the rest of the population finds it hard to emulate.\nGood time management skills aren't about the amount of time available to implement a task. It's about making the little time you have to be as productive as possible.\nIf you are desperate to improve your time management skills, you are in the right place. This course will teach you how to multiply your time through outsourcing and deep work. You'll also learn how to eliminate common obstacles like procrastination and perfectionism that only slow you down while working.\nIf you’ve previously tried ineffective time management courses, this offers a break from that. We'll not only teach you about time management but also about \"Joining the New Rich\" as well. The new rich are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the new rich: time & mobility. This is an art and a science that Tim Ferriss refers to as lifestyle design.\nWith the practical nature of this course, you’ll almost certainly improve your finances & time management skills as soon as you start implementing the lessons from the course.\nTime management directly correlates with your cognitive abilities.

      "description": "Neurodiversity can be challenging at the best of times. Fortunately, with a phone or laptop and wifi, there are a host of tools out there that will help us navigate neurodivergent challenges.\nThis course is for anyone who deals with dyslexia, ADHD, or other neurodivergent challenges, or anyone who just needs better focus, writing, or reading.\nIt may be that you are working in an office environment daily where you struggle to focus\nor write reports, or you are a student having to deal with essay writing,\nor you have a child in school who struggles to concentrate in class.\nNot only do I have to live with dyslexia and ADHD, but I also have three children with the same diagnoses (it's a lively house, to say the least). So I am in a good position to share with you all the tips, tricks, and hacks that one learns from living with dyslexia and ADHD.\nWhat you will learn:\nI have broken this course down into three sections:\nPart one is about focusing, just dealing with getting your \"stuff\" done!\nPart two is about that dreaded task of writing. That is exactly what I am doing at the moment. Also, the tools (that I am using at the moment) will help you with the task of getting stuff on paper.\nPart three is all about reading, just helping you get through that essay, journal, paper, or report that you have been asked to read and edit.\nWhy Should You Take This Class?\nEven if you do not have dyslexia and ADHD, I bet you know someone who does. Maybe you can just get some tools to share with them. Or maybe, even though you do have dyslexia and ADHD, you may still need some tips and hacks to be able to focus better at work or polish up your writing. This course will definitely help there. Or maybe English isn't your first language (that's a word I can never spell:/). If so, simply having a tool that reads back to you or checks your writing could be really helpful.",

You don’t have time.\nYou are super busy, you have kids, you have a full-time job, and a gazillion things to do each day, so you can’t possibly make room to start learning animation.\nRight?\nI decided to create this course because I have met a lot of subscribers who would love to learn animation but they just can’t find the time to do it.\nIf this sounds like you, then you would love it if each day could just last for 30 hours instead of 24.\nThat would make every dream you have come true right? Starting with the powerful goal of being able to tell stories and sharing ideas using animation.\nBut reality check, days only provide us with 24 hours, so the question is... can we do something about it?\nWhat if I tell you that there was a way to accomplish everything you need to do, have time to learn animation and on top of that, have some time to spare?\nWould you believe me?\nWell, I am here to tell you, it is possible. I have done it and in this course, I will teach you exactly how you can do it too.\nTo give you a clear idea of what you can accomplish, let’s talk about an example we use in the course.\nSteve.\nHe is married, has a lot of imagination. He makes his buddies laugh with all kinds of crazy stories, and is thinking about learning animation to share all of his jokes through animation, and make people smile around the world.\nThe problem is that he has so many things to do each week.\nHe has a full-time job\nHe likes to spend time with his family and friends\nHe likes to go on a date each week with his wife, to maintain the intimacy in the relationship.\nGoes to the gym 3 times a week\nHe has important commitments that are a priority in his life, which are\nTo render community services on his church\nAnd help his kids with his school homework.\nHe has multiple solicitations to help his family like:\nHelp his kids to get ready for school\nPick them up from school\nGiving a ride to his son to visit his friends\nAnd sometimes, attend a meeting in his kid’s school.\nOh, and on top of all that, he is finally fulfilling his promise and is building a tree house in his backyard. This takes a lot of his time, but it’s worth it because now his kids love him more than ever, the house is 50% complete and still needs a lot of hard work to do.\nAnd Steve, on top of all of that, he is planning to learn animation?\nNo way. It’s probably better to just keep the stories and imagination to himself, and deprive the rest of the world, from knowing about his funny jokes.\nSad story.\nWell, this course teaches Steve how to exactly organize his activities, be more productive and be able to, not only be able to accomplish all of that on a weekly basis but also learn animation and even have some spare time to catch a movie on Netflix every now and then.\nThis course will give you the techniques and tools you need to accomplish all of this with your time.\nEnroll now and learn how to be more productive, have time to learn animation and even have some time to spare doing other hobbies or catching a movie on Netflix.\nSee you inside.",

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the principles, practices, and theories that shape how humans share meaning. You will explore communication as a dynamic process, learning how messages are created, transmitted, interpreted, and responded to in personal, professional, and public settings.\nThe course begins with an overview of the communication process, introducing foundational concepts such as sender, receiver, message, channel, feedback, and noise. You will examine key communication models and basic theories that explain how meaning is constructed and understood. These concepts set the stage for applying communication principles in real-life scenarios.\nSubsequent units focus on specific contexts: interpersonal communication explores building relationships, managing conflict, and using verbal and nonverbal cues effectively; small group communication addresses group dynamics, leadership, collaboration, and decision-making strategies; organizational communication examines formal and informal networks, workplace culture, and professional communication practices; and mass communication investigates media effects, communication technologies, ethical concerns, and the role of mass media in shaping society.\nThroughout the course, you will be encouraged to reflect on your own communication style and develop strategies to improve clarity, confidence, and effectiveness. Real-world examples, case studies, and practical activities help you apply theoretical knowledge to everyday interactions.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to analyze communication processes in multiple settings, apply theories to enhance understanding, and improve the quality of your interactions. This knowledge will not only strengthen your personal and professional relationships but also prepare you for advanced study in communication, media, and related fields.",

Knowing C# opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.\nC# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.\nThe C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.\nWelcome to the Certified Professional in #C Programming - Practice Test the only course you need to test your skill of coding with #C.\nThe course includes 2 Practice Test builds your programming knowledge while making real-world C# projects.\nIn this course, you’ll be exposed to fundamental programming concepts using C# and to help you practice and test your knowledge using quizzes.\n\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\n\nmethods\nvariables\narrays\nif statements\nloops\nClasses and Objects\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nand much much more!\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\nC# basic knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\nThis course consists of 3 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

      "description": "How do you conquer that endless reading list? And even if you do get around to reading, how do you process all that new information? In this course I will teach you a system for extracting information from the books you read, so that you get more reading done, learn more, and make that information more useful to you in the future.\n-------\nThis was the course I was searching for, for a long time!…This course should be seen by all starting students or (like me) all struggling old students who missed this in the past. — Udemy review\nDanny, does a great job laying the foundation of \"batch\" reading as well as offering many great pointers to facilitate and maximize the process. If you desire, or need to, do lots of research reading (business or academic) you will love this course. — Udemy review\n\n-------\nI will help you implement a system to read books faster and get the information you want from them.\nFind more time for making reading a life-long habit\nLearn to read faster\nLearn more from the books you read\nSet up a system for making information more useful to you later\nConquer your reading list!\n-------\nThe information is not just for students or academics, but also for anyone who is trying to learn a new topic for personal or professional use. There is so much information available out there, this course provides tools to read and then extract and organize info in a meaningful way, such that you do not inefficiently duplicate work by reading twice…I can definitely apply many of the topics in this course immediately to improve my efficiency. — Udemy review\n-------\nGet More Out of Your Books\nThe endless list of books that you want to read sometimes stunts us from even beginning. And even those who do read regularly do not have a great system for actually getting the most from those books. By implementing the system this course teaches, students will begin to conquer their reading list, and feel confident that the information that they learn will be close by for the rest of their lives. Even in the age of blog posts and reddit threads, people still know their is value in reading the books of experts. Students who take this course will have a system in place to learn from those great minds who put the best of their knowledge into the books they write.\n-------\nThe course is well structured and extremely informative. Prof. Zacharias delivery kept me engaged. I have been searching for this type of course for years. I highly recommend this course to anyone that enjoys reading, but more so to students. My next semester starts on Wednesday and I look forward to implementing this system. Thank you! — Udemy review\n-------\nContent and Overview\nThe course begins with providing you some tips and encouragement to make more time for reading. The more intentional someone is about reading regularly, the more it will become a life-long habit.\nAlthough not a speed reading course, a section of the course is devoted to helping students to read at a faster pace. I cover both hard copy and eBook reading.\nThe actual system of information extraction is thoroughly presented to the student, so that they clearly understand the steps taken through a book to get the information you wish to retain.\n-------\nYou will find no hyped up claims of doubling your reading speed in this course. It's a breath of fresh air. Reading can be hard work, but I appreciated the simple, no-nonsense approach of this course. — Udemy review\nI wish I had this information back in high school and college. Perfect system for teachers and public speakers to organize topics and information from textbooks. Thanks Danny! — Udemy Review",

My name is Chase and I've been studying self-development and productivity for a while now but while conducting my research I ran into a major problem. That problem was that it was easy to learn about self-development and productivity but no matter how much I learned it was still impossible to implement or too difficult to be consistent.\n\n\nI ended up with a massive to-do list full of great ideas from the top minds in the space but I was unable to take action on that list. It wasn't until I studied how our mind works that I was able to have a breakthrough that changed everything for me.\n\n\nOnce I learned how the mind's operating system works I was able to focus on 4 subjects that strengthen your ability to do difficult things. When you study and practice these 4 subjects anything that was difficult for you becomes easy.\n\n\nStarting a business, exercising, eating well, dating, public speaking, studying a high-income skill or going for a promotion. When you study these four subjects you strengthen the part of your mind that makes it easier to do anything difficult.\n\n\nSince learning this I have been able to get multiple promotions at work, get over my fear of public speaking, start an online education company and be comfortable being on camera. This knowledge has allowed me to have deep, uncomfortable conversations with my spouse which have been extremely fruitful for our long-term relationship.\n\n\nEverything in my life is better after understanding how my mind works and educating myself on the four subjects so I know it can greatly increase the quality of your own life.\n\n\nThis course will help you level up no matter where you are, unlock your true potential, and make difficult things easy so that you can create the life of your dreams.\n\n\nIf you are still on the fence please check out the first few free videos as there is enough information there to get you started.\n\n\nI'll see you in video one!",

Managing time is a very complex process and self-assessment provides some measures of your strengths and weaknesses.\nProject 2: DISC Profiling and Time Management\nOur hard-wired DISC style does not explain everything about our views on time management. Our beliefs impact how we view time in general and how we view time management. For example, many of us have heard the saying, \"time is money\". There are others who believe time is about enjoying every moment. Our culture also impacts how we view time. What country and region we live in impacts our attitudes and values about time. There are some places where meetings are scheduled for 10:00 a.m. and expected to start on time. On the other hand, there are other places where meetings have a start time of \"roughly 10:00 a.m.\"\nWe judge ourselves based on our intention, but we judge others based on their observed behaviors. For example, we scheduled a meeting at 10:00 a.m. with the expectation that it will start on time, and someone shows up late. We may see that as being disrespectful of others, but the person showing up late had to finish up a few things and did not view being late as disrespectful.\nProject 3: Self-Assessing Your Work-Life Balance\nThe purpose of this assessment instrument is to heighten your awareness of the behaviors that are affecting your work-life balance. The quiz will also provide a means to rate your collective behaviors and present a score that can give you insight into your effectiveness in achieving work-life balance.\nHere’s how to use this assessment questionnaire. For each question, circle the number that best describes your answer. If you don’t have an opinion or you feel you do not have sufficient data to draw an opinion, then mark “0” (No comment).\n\n\nAdditional Workbooks\n1. Activity Workbook\n2.

      "description": "What is Lean?\nLean is not a tool, it is a way of thinking. Lean can be applied in all walks of Life. So simply Lean is a way of life\nLean is a strategy that focuses on relentless elimination of wastes with the objective of making every step, task, & activity creates value for the customers.\nLean also means doing more with less – Less Time, less space, less human effort, less machinery, less material – while giving customers what they want\nThough the principles are derived from Japanese Auto maker TOYOTA, the name Lean is the term was first coined by John Krafcik in his 1988 article, \"Triumph of the Lean Production System,\" based on his master's thesis at the MIT Sloan School of Management.\nAfter a team from MIT under the leadership of Jim Womack published the Book named “The Machine that changed the world” in 1990s, the black box of Toyota production System was opened for external world. Today Lean is used as No 1 Strategy for Operational Excellence by most of the leading organizations throughout the world. Initially the application of Lean principles was limited to engineering particularly automotive industries but during the last decade lean is adapted by many other Industries including IT, Education and Healthcare.\nWhy lean a powerful strategy for Operational Excellence?\nØ  First reason is its simplicity.  It does not require any special knowledge except Conviction, Discipline and Commitment.\nØ   It is a very good cultural transformation tool. Makes every employee to recognize waste and contribute for its elimination\nØ  It helps in Reducing lead-times to the extent up to 90 % which makes customer delighted\nØ  It helps to find and solve problem in a fastest way before it becomes very expensive.\nØ  It allows decision making at the bottom most level in the organization\nØ  It helps in reducing  inventory and effective utilization of space\nOverall it improves Business results significantly, including profitability.\nMyths and Facts about Lean\nØ  Myth: Lean is intended to reduce man power\nFact: Lean is intended to eliminate waste not people. In reality, lean provides lot of opportunities for people to grow both intellectually and financially.\nØ  Myth: Lean works only in Mass Production/Automotive Industry.\nFact: Lean can be applied to any Industries. Lean is a proven concept even in Industries like IT, BPO, Healthcare, Pharma, Banks, Education, Hotels etc... Lean can also be implemented on high impact public sector projects like Traffic Management in Metro cities. Lean works equally well in Low volume; High variety environment\nØ  Myth: My organization is already lean.\nFact: No organization is perfect. Even Toyota says “Today’s perfection is tomorrow’s mediocrity”. Lean is a Journey and not a destination.\nØ  Myth: Lean will not work in unionized organizations ( with Trade unions)\nFact: Lean works equally well in unionized environment. But it needs to be communicated properly and buy-in should be obtained before starting the journey.\nPrinciples which helps in successful implementation of Lean\nØ  Leaders at the top level should lead by example\nØ  Lean is not just tools. It is a Culture, development of people.\nØ  Employees should be allowed to stop production to solve problems as and when they occur. Solve the root cause not symptoms\nØ  Quick response to any problems/abnormalities\nØ  Lean is not a quick fix. It should be implemented with long-term results in mind\nØ  Encourage employees to solve problems using Kaizens (Continual Improvement ideas)\nØ  Focus on both process and Results\nØ  Hate all Seven Wastes and work towards eliminating them ( Overproduction, Inventory, Waiting, Motion, Extra Process, Transportation and Defects)\nØ  Respect for people and Time\nØ  Commitment to continuous learning.\nØ  Lean is not a tool , it is way of thinking",

The concept is towards making Using Voice to Make Technology Disappear. The module actively provides Private-By-Design, DecentralizedVoice Assistant Technology and Solutions. The file once created is further deployed to  to your Raspberry Pi, in particular for the normal distribution. It is well explained how we go doing about it.\nThe educational experience is delicately woven into the fabric of the module, which also provides a practical plan for the establishment of a chatbot service that is on par with that of ALEXA. The educational experience can be found throughout the program. The end aim is to get to a stage where you can get rid of any requirement for technology help by only using your voice. Reaching that point is the ultimate goal. A proactive offer of technology for decentralized voice assistants is made accessible by the module, in addition to solutions that are meant to be kept a secret. As soon as the procedure of creating the file is finished, it is immediately sent to your Raspberry Pi so that it may be subjected to further processing, in particular with the intention of achieving standardized distribution. It is not difficult to understand what course of action we need to follow if we are going to be successful in fixing the issue that has been brought to our attention as a result of the fact that it has been given to us.",

      "description": "Introducing Notion\nNotion is a productivity tool that provides users the ability to create databases with multiple views and various methods to organise information. These facilities are not just limited to single users, but teams as a whole as well. Common uses include note taking, personal task management, project management, amongst others.\nNotion's unique selling point is that it is an all-in-one workspace for individuals or teams, allowing everyone to concentrate all their information on one platform rather than having multiple platforms and cluttered information. Additionally, organising and beautifying information has been made extremely user-friendly and seamless.\nWhat you can expect from Notion - From Head to Toe\nThis is truly a complete Notion course where we bring you every feature available in Notion, right from the basics to the advanced. You will be studying our content in a chronological fashion as our videos are arranged to bring you through Notion step-by-step. Some of the topics that we will cover in this course are:\nBlocks, Pages, and Table Properties\nDatabases (and multiple views)\nRelational Databases\nFormulas, Relations and Rollups\nTeam Collaboration\nReady-to-use templates\nAutomations (coming soon)\nAnd much much more!\nWhat makes our course special?\nThere are several tools out there that help teams and individuals get acclimatised to Notion. So what makes our course stand out from the crowd? Well, we offer the following as well\nDatabase Demonstrations\nWhen we teach our content, we focus purely on the logic of the feature first to ensure you understand what it means. However, we know that it might be confusing to apply logic to real-life situations, and hence at the end of major milestones in the video, we included Database Demonstrations to better facilitate our teaching.\n\n\nThe Miscellaneous Section\nIn our videos, we go the extra mile to provide Notion templates that we use on a day-to-day basis to help organise our teams and individual workspaces. However, these templates are not very straightforward and require some prior setting up. Our videos will bring you through a detailed walkthrough of how these templates are set up and how you can use them to empower your lives.\n\n\nConstant Updates\nWe are always trying to improve so we welcome any feedback that you might have for us. Thereafter, we are willing to reshoot particular videos to allow for better teaching. Secondly, as Notion updates particular features, we will update our videos to match these features to ensure consistency. Lastly, as we develop more templates, we will update the Miscellaneous Section with new templates and updated videos.\nAutomations (coming soon)\nAutomations are extremely tricky to get right, and most enterprise automation systems are not affordable and simple enough for consumers. We will show you the right way to build automations into Notion. What's better is that it is extremely simple, efficient, and best of all, no coding is required.\nOverall, we have made this course for you. In one line, this course is Made by students and entrepreneurs, for students and entrepreneurs.\nIt's your Choice!\nTo conclude, we are entrepreneurs who began using Notion together and understood the applications facilities incrementally. As we went around educating our friends on how they can empower their journeys, we received several remarks that we should make videos on how Notion is used and upload them on learning platforms for worldwide accessibility, bringing us here.\nWe'd like to thank you for considering our course and we hope to see you soon!",

      "description": "Emotional intelligence has been attributed as the skill most associated with both personal and professional success. Yet, how often do we think about our emotional intelligence and the impact it has on our lives? How often do we practice emotional intelligent skills? Emotional intelligence is often mistaken for how friendly a person can be with others; however emotional intelligence is much more complex than that. Emotional intelligence is actually the ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others. It is also the ability to be able to respond in the most productive manner for our highest good as well as the benefit of the other person or people involved. Emotional intelligence focuses on both self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, and relationship management. During this workshop, we’ll delve into specific skills to increase emotional intelligence, and the real-life applications of emotional intelligence in your day-to-day life. Skills covered during this workshop include emotional literacy, ability to respond vs. react, and empathy. As a result of these skills and the awareness and management of emotions, we are able to make a difference by being rational, mindful, purposeful and realize the desired results we seek. People begin to notice that their influence increases, they're able to inspire themselves and others, they're recognized as leaders, and they are sought out as mentors, coaches, and teammates.",

It gave me not only the tools to be more productive immediately but also the confidence I needed to hit the ground running. I’m looking forward to completing a few projects before Christmas that I’ve been putting off constantly. Thanks, Tam! This is exactly what I needed.\"\n\n\n\"I love all of Tam's courses! This one is short and sweet, but super helpful. As a mom to teens and caretaker to parents, I so appreciate the permission to not hustle all the time. I'll definitely be using her Trello organization and list tips to be productive in the short blocks of time I have available.\"\n\n\n\"This course was perfect for me, and it came just at the right time. I'm just starting my freelance writing business, I have two newsletters and an ebook floating around on the internet.\"\n\n\n\"I love this course! Your fusion of science, short practical videos, and steps helped close the 101 tabs. I felt seen when it started with all the productivity tools and books I've tried before and questioned why they didn’t work for me. This course delivers what it says on the tin - it's perfect for messy minds with unpredictable lives. I loved being prompted to take action and set up a project plan during the course. Very helpful, I'm looking forward to checking in on my progress at the end of the week.\"\n\n\n\"With a ton of stuff to do and scraps of paper with notes all over the place, I needed something to organise my work and get my mind into some kind of order. I now have lots of tools and resources to organise my projects so I can spend more time on my writing and the things that matter.\"\n\n\nDON'T LET ANOTHER YEAR SLIP BY WONDERING \"WHAT IF?\"\nJoin Make It Happen! — Personal Productivity for Frazzled Scatterbrains today and start turning your messy ideas into real, valuable projects to boost your personal productivity and enrich your life.\nDon't let another year slip by wondering \"what if?\" Ready to stop letting your ideas sit on the shelf?

There are many people who are good presenters but they lack the skills to adjust to questions or lead discussions in a positive direction. Teteak’s concepts are fundamental to becoming a dynamic communicator with more energy and less anxiety. In the day and age of communicating through texts and emails, people have lost the art of face to face communication and explaining their ideas clearly and confidently. Dynamic communication leads to productive interactions and expedited decisions. Dynamic communicators can solve problems and facilitate decision making faster than a person who struggles with communicating in an ever changing industry. If you only have time to attend the class, do so and without any distractors. If you practice the skills learned, you will begin to notice the pickup in your energy and productivity.”\nRichard Welton -- Project Manager\n\"Tremendously profound, explaining how to be perceptive of the needs of your audience while projecting the confidence necessary for an entertaining, informative presentation.\"\nTravis Vroman -- Software Developer\n“Jason’s advice is practical, straightforward, and incredibly helpful for anyone looking to greatly improve his or her presentation skills.”\nRyan Anderson -- Director of Instructional Design and Development\nAbout the Instructor\nInternational Public Speaking Coach, TEDx Speaker and Best Selling author Jason Teteak has taught more than one million people how to flawlessly command attention and connect with audiences in their unique style.\nHe’s won praise and a wide following for his original methods, his engaging style, and his knack for transferring communications skills via practical, simple, universal and immediately actionable techniques.\nOr as he puts it “No theoretical fluff”.\nJason gained recognition at EPIC Systems in the medical software industry, where he was known as “trainer of trainers of trainers.”\nHe has developed more than fifty presentation and communication training programs ranging in length from one hour to three days that serve as the basis for The Rule the Room Method.\nIn 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 he was named #1 Best Selling coach on Public Speaking for his on-demand video teaching tools that quickly took off for over 100,000 online students around the world.\nTeteak has flipped the model and changed the approach to great Public Speaking for even the most seasoned veterans.",

      "description": "Unlock the Secrets to a Stronger Immune System: Public Health Strategies for Lasting Wellness\nAre you ready to make the ultimate investment in yourself? Your immune system holds the key to safeguarding your well-being, and understanding it is your first step to a healthier, resilient you.\nDuring the pandemic, millions of people lost their lives. This prompted me to take action by gathering credible information about strengthening the immune system—primarily to protect my family. I then decided to share this knowledge hoping it could help others during a critical time. But its value didn't end there and it is relevant today. Whether you want to stay informed about public health or build lasting habits for a healthier life, this course delivers practical, science-backed strategies that stand the test of time.\nYour immune system is the frontline defense against the unseen invaders that enter your body. It's an intricate network of cells, organs, and tissues, working tirelessly in perfect harmony to shield your body from infection. While it won't make you invincible, a robust immune system can be the difference between a brief bout of illness and prolonged suffering. It's the ultimate game-changer when it comes to survival!\nBut here's the kicker: Your immune system isn't just your guardian against the common cold or flu; it's a superhero that can fend off foes as formidable as cancer. By annihilating rogue cancer cells as they emerge, your immune system is your ever-vigilant protector. Even minor nuisances like the common cold could turn into threats without its watchful eye.\nYet, the immune system remains a captivating enigma.

I quickly found myself pausing in between sections to engage in effective new actions and habits! Highly recommended!\"\n\"The course is only 1.5 hours but in roughly 10 days that I've been following his recommendation, I've returned the time invested 2-3 times.\"\n\"Quality execution, rich in content, good English.\"\n\"It's a very clear compendium for time management. \"\n\"I especially like the section on how our brain functions which you don't normally find in time management books.\"\n\n\nTime is precious.

In all this, they usually do their best to get stuff done and also help their colleagues.\nThis course will help you with those issues.

All comes from a teacher passionate about the topic, who has over 10 years of experience in large corporations and smaller companies and spent over 6 years in learning and development.\n\n\nI believe this is a missing piece in our education system, so we will learn:\nHow our brain functions and why we sometimes need lists. Also how to form sustainable, long-term habits.\n4 common mistakes that people make with their task lists and how to solve them.\n7 strategies to overcome distractions.\nOver 30 best apps and plugins that support everyday organization.\nHow to effectively plan our days in under 5 minutes.\nHow to effectively prioritize in short-term, mid-term and long-term.\n\n\nWhen you finish the course you will:\nBe able to stay organized, even with changing priorities and distractions - this will lower your stress and give you the feeling of control.\nBe more effective and have more time and energy for things that are important to you - family, friends, hobby, development, leisure.\nBe able to focus on what is the most important and make progress\nBe able to understand various time management techniques and how they fit together.\nBe able to create your own productivity system that fits your personal style and way of living - this will help you live your own way, instead of copying others and waste your time on things that won't work.\n\n\nYou will also:\nBe much more focused and feel better work satisfaction.\nHave much better prioritization skills and more easily say \"no\" to less important things.\nSpend less time on distractions, social media, multitasking.\n\n\nThis course is for professionals who want to organize the chaos, have better work satisfaction, while having more time for family, friends, hobby, development and relax.\nThis course is not for highly organized people, that successfully implemented GTD - they need an advanced course. This course is also not for people who hate organizing because we will have to give some structure to our tasks and projects. If you hate organizing, you will quickly get tired.",

This is not just another SMART goal course, but an in-depth course that will give you the most profound techniques and tools to use in any life situation, and for any life area: finances, weight loss, career, family, relationships, health and so on.\nNeuroscience discovered how law of attraction works, and we have designed specific strategies for achieving your goals in a practical, realistic and achievable way. You will learn advanced techniques like SCORE, SET and Timeline techniques, how to deal with blocks and limitations and how to set a wellformed outcome so that your goals can soon become your reality.\nHave you ever asked yourself how is it possible for some people to succeed and achieve their goals, and not for others? Do you know people in your life who seem to easily accomplish their desires? And do you know people that always seem to have everything go wrong for them? Would you like to know the difference between them, and how it is possible for two human beings to have such different life results and therefore realities?\nBecause achieving goals is something you are doing everyday anyway, only you are probably not aware of the strategies you use for the goals you achieve easily, and the strategies you use for the goals you may not have achieved yet. And that's the trick. How is it perfectly logical to you to achieve certain things in life, and how is it perfectly logical to you not to achieve other things in life? Among all the advanced techniques that you will know how to apply, you will also learn about spotting blocks and limitations and how to deal with them. Since this is not always the easiest part, I will show you how you can help yourself to become a super proficient achiever.  You'll be able to put those learnings into practice and if you need more help, I am always there for you.\nThere is a lot of information in every lesson so you may want to take one step at a time, and not binge the entire course. Let the information settle down before you move on, so you can be fresh and ready for new learnings and resources you are about to receive. And very important – do the assignments. Only going through the course won't do the trick. This is an action oriented course, so if you are ready to take action, then you will find a lot of value in this course.\nAfter the course – the sky is your limit – if you choose to use the learnings I give you - wisely. And before we move forward, be warned that after this course you will achieve your goals, so be careful what you wish for – because it might just become true.\nWith these words in mind, and if you are ready to change some things in your life, I'll see you in the first lesson.",

      "description": "Most time management and productivity books or courses present generic or one-size-fits-all methods for facilitating the process of managing time. But similar to going on a diet or starting a new exercise regimen, these methods work for only a short period of time; for the majority of people these approaches are impossible to maintain long term.  In fact, you’ve probably even considered the possibility that maybe it’s you. Maybe you are the failure. Maybe you are simply destined to be terrible at managing time, prioritizing your tasks and completing your projects.  Maybe you should give up now. Or maybe the problem with time management techniques is something you never even suspected.\nIt’s understandable that you’d feel discouraged with all that you’ve tried before. The reason that you feel like such a failure is NOT because you are inherently flawed. It’s NOT because you are permanently disorganized or a poor manager of your time.  It’s NOT because there is anything wrong with you at all. The reason that you haven’t been successful thus far is simply because time management is NOT a one-size-fits-all situation. What is drastically successful for one person is not necessarily a maintainable process for another person.  Yet most self-help books and courses treat time management as though it is.",

It helps to break the barrier of unfamiliarity and helps to form a better connection with the recipient of a message.\n\n\nI’ll teach u in this class how to correctly decipher body language messages, how to recognize lies and deceit from non-verbal cues and how to use positive body language to your advantage in your everyday life.\n\n\nWe will start by learning the basics of body language.\nThen we will try to understand how each of our body parts can influence our body language and send non-verbal messages to our interlocutors.\nStarting with hand arm and thumb gestures, then how our eyes and smiles can talk, then how our feet and legs can convey how we’re feeling. We’ll also learn how to attract attention, how detect lies and deceit and to address listeners in public speaking. And of course we will see how cultural differences can influence our body language.\n\n\nAt the end of this class you will be able to use positive body language to your advantage to better convey your message, avoid negative body language in order to minimize to then chances of misunderstanding and with a bit of training how to recognize signs of deceit, stalling and lies in your interlocutors.",

      "description": "Hi, my name is Anne Bolsius and I am really glad you are reading this! When you start this course, you will notice straight away that you are implementing practical tools that have a major cross-cutting impact on 15 key management skills. This course is very different from other management skills courses out there since you will certainly change your behaviour, in comparison to learning theoretical frameworks that are hard to apply. The tools in this course are relevant to any managerial position (line management and project management), easy to implement and will deliver an enormous impact on your management skills. Your colleagues and team will soon experience you as a manager who is calm, in control, who is building an engaged team and who is delivering results.\nProfessionally, my career has been a mix of line management and project management roles and I have worked in various industries and various countries and have managed teams of over 100 people. I know what it is like to work in a demanding environment! During my career my interest grew in what successful managers have in common and what the bad ones are lacking, and that in combination with my passion for having a positive impact on people’s lives, I added all my knowledge and experience in this course on the Udemy platform.\nTo sum up, I am absolutely and utterly passionate about helping managers to take away stress and worries, and to grow their confidence and joy at work!\n\n\nThe tools of this course have a cross-cutting impact on the following key management skills:\nDecision making\nProblem solving\nPeople management\nPerformance management\nListening\nCoaching\nMotivating\nDelegating\nCommunication\nStrategy planning and execution\nTime management\nConceptual skills\nAnalytical skills\nRelationship building\nStress resilience\n\n\nEach section contains three downloadable pdf’s:\n1. A document with an overview of the tools discussed\n2. A document that contains the assignment and self-assessment, that will guide you towards successful implementation of all tools\n3. A document that contains links to relevant studies, research, articles of experts to justify my program, and other interesting resources for further reading, if you’d like to dive deeper into the topics of that section\n\n\nThis course contains:\n- All required tools to boost your people and performance management skills\n- A complete Time Management system\n- Multiple time-saver tools\n- Proven and simple stress management techniques\n- Lean principles that every manager needs to know\n- Powerful Lean and Six Sigma tools that everyone should, and CAN utilize\n- Standard language to conduct the performance dialogue\n- Standard language to give feedback about behaviour and performance\n- Everything you need to know about performance dashboards\n- And so much more!\nThe tools of this course are real and practical things that will change the way you work, in contrast to vague management models or theoretical frameworks that you find in too many courses out there. Examples of tools that I will give you are digital apps that I recommend using, step-by-step processes to achieve a wanted result, standard language you should use to achieve a certain response or outcome, specific meetings with a specific agenda you should conduct, checklists you can apply in any business environment, and so on.\nCopyright 2021 Anne Bolsius, All rights reserved",

      "description": "Time is a funny thing - an abstract concept, yet it plays such an important role in all of our lives. It's one of those rare things that cannot be bought, bartered, traded or negotiated for - at least not in an absolute sense. Yes, we can trade portions of our time for other things - this is something that most of us already do by working. However, the total amount of time a person has to live his or her life is finite and fixed. Period. Yet, it is something that we all long to have in greater abundance.\n\nMyths and legends abound with tales of men who wasted their entire lives on the hopeless quest of trying to cheat Father Time. Reality, however, also has similar stories to tell; one good example is that of Juan Ponce de León, a Spanish conquistador and explorer in the 15th century, who, it is rumoured, spent a great deal of his life searching for the Fountain of Youth - some even claimed that he found it.\nAlbert Einstein, on the other hand, believed that the past, the present and the future all exist simultaneously. For him, time was a relative concept and existence was the only thing that mattered\nThe man we felt got it right was Henry David Thoreau when he said that \"I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better.\"\nBuilding on the premise set forth by Thoreau, that is exactly what this course aims to teach you; How to make your days better by utilising your time more efficiently.\nIn the first part of the course you are introduced to 50 simple, yet effective time management tips that you can implement in your everyday life.\nIn the second part of the course you are taught how to overcome procrastination - that great enemy of efficient time management. Here, you are firstly provided with a series of lectures that focuses on getting you into the right mindset for getting things done in a timely manner on a consistent basis. Secondly, as a special bonus, you are provided with your own personal 12-month goal achievement system that will help you to transform your life.\nWhat are you waiting for? Come join MindMekka in this course and start making your days better. Why not start today?",

Yet more and more organisations and managers are struggling with the impact of email on day-to-day work. When it comes to productivity, Email might as well be known as the \"serial killer application\". It has become our single most important business tool yet we pay little attention how to properly use, and not use, email. We believe this is a shame, as everyone spends increasing time on email and teaching yourself some basic principles can save you valuable hours every week.\nSpeedmailing specializes in short yet powerful workshops to make your use of email more effective. Consider the following achievable benefits:\n- An empty inbox every single day.\n- Have more control over your tasks and commitments.\n- Being able to trust that you are not overlooking things.\n- Have peace of mind so you can make better decisions and spend more time on important tasks.\n- Be quicker (and thus spend less time) on email\nWe also have a book available which is called \"Speedmailing: Turn your work enemy into your best work tool\" by Richard Wolfe (Author).\n\n\nSurvival kit for 100+ messages a day\nAre you struggling with the constant overflow of email and other messaging apps? Do you feel your email keeps you from the “real work” you should be doing?\n\nBecoming better at managing email will give you more oversight of your tasks, an increased level of concentration and a sense of calm in your workday. Speedmailing is a simple and practical method that allows you to handle email and your productivity apps like a pro.",

      "description": "Do you want significant and faster results with your clients? Do you feel like you need to understand how your client's mind work?\n\n\nPsychological science is the scientific study of the mind and behaviour. It provides us with reliable information and tools to understand, predict and change behaviour. However, most coaching courses don't offer psychology or neuroscience as part o their curriculum. As a result, coaching professionals are left with little, if any, basic knowledge on how the mind works. So, it's not a surprise why so many career coaching professionals are unsuccessful.\nAfter learning from world-renowned scientists and professors at the University of Cambridge, I have decided to share what I have learned. I have carefully designed this course to address challenges faced by executive/career coaching and self-development professionals. Some of these challenges include:\n- Increasing productivity\n- Adjusting to transitions\n- Managing stress\n\n\nIn this exciting and easy-to-follow course, you will learn topics such as personality types, attitude change, forming habits, heuristics as the key to decision-making and much more. You will also have access to tools and questionnaires that allow you to understand your client's behaviour and decisions (backed by science).\nI will continue to update this course with topics relevant to professionals like yourself. You will stay up-to-date with the latest research in psychology and neuroscience, useful to you. I want your clients to see significant and faster results, and therefore, feel satisfied with your work.\n\n\nLet's get started.\nRenato Boemer\nA member of the British Psychological Society (MBPsS)",

But how many of them plan and work towards the same? It is unfortunate that how many of them, first of all know how to prepare a financial plan and work towards the same?\nSchools and Colleges provide them excellent education to earn good amount of money, but nowhere it is taught how to manage their money to live well today and plan for their family’s good financial future.\nPersonal Financial Planning solves this problem. It helps you and your family to live well today and ensure your family’s good financial future.\nFinancial Planning is based on the fact that every individual has certain basic financial needs to meet at various stages of life such as getting married, buying assets, creating funds for children’s higher education, daughter’s wedding, and for a comfortable retirement life.\nTo have a financial plan, you don’t have to be mega-rich or to be old and approaching retirement. It does not matter how much you earn or what your age is.\nFinancial planning enables you to develop strategies to achieve all your financial needs / goals and deal with unforeseen needs that may arise in life.\nThe best part is that it ensures right amount of money is available at the right point of time in the future to achieve life goals.\nThe flow of this course is designed for easy learning and clear understanding through step by step simple approach. It is like learning a, b,c, d…., no fuss.\nI have prepared a Financial Planning booklet in pdf format, and the charts in excel sheets for you to complete your Financial Planning for your family.",

If you're like most people what's limiting you from the next step isn't really your main skill area - whether that's programming, writing, or otherwise - it's about learning how to use your time in a way that adds up to something releasable.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use a simple process to avoid indecision or wasted effort while making continual progress towards achieving your bigger goals. No more feeling demoralized over hard work that never seems to go anywhere. You'll learn to plan effectively and stay on track to launch your long-term projects, every time.\nWhether you want to start your own YouTube channel, set up a podcast, develop a video game, or something else entirely, the strategies you'll learn here can be applied to nearly any kind of project. Even better, you'll learn how to adapt your plans as you go, so instead of feeling anxiety around predicting the future you'll move forward with confidence that you're prepared to make the best of how things are playing out.\n2 Full Productivity Audiobooks/Ebooks Included (Additional 7 hours 24 min Audio)\nTo help you even more, at the end of this course you'll receive two full productivity audiobooks (including the ebook transcripts!): Self-Command (run time 4 hours 54 minutes) and Self-Doubt (2 hours 30 minutes). These audio programs teach techniques and effective ways of thinking to help you follow through on the current task, as well as the tools to give yourself a chance doing something you've never done before. By combining those techniques with this course you'll have everything you need to not only set up a plan, but act on each step of it, and target your plans at goals you never thought possible.\nThese 2 audiobooks were developed separately, sold as a bundle for $41 with a 5/5 rating, but will be yours with this new video course at no extra cost. You'll be able to simply download the audio or ebook versions as the resources attached for the final section.\n\n\nStop letting indecision or wasted effort hold you back - enroll in this course today and start achieving the bigger results you've always wanted.\n\n\nResponses to Self-Command and Self-Doubt, my two productivity audiobooks/ebooks both fully included with your purchase of this course (downloadable as the resources for the last section):\n\n\n\"Ever since I started Self-Command, I get so much more done in a day than ever before, with less unintended side tracking. I'm so very grateful for Chris' wonderful work. I highly recommend it.\"\n-Sang Nguyen\n\n\n\"Several years after listening to Self-Command, Chris’ whiteboard technique continues to be central to my daily productivity. Having already been a bit of a nerd for productivity hacks and techniques, I found the techniques and mindsets Chris discusses to be really fresh and incredibly practical.\"\n-Praneil Kamat\n\n\n\"I have diagnosed ADHD, so it's always hard to make decisions about how I should be spending my time. Self-Command gave me new tools to help cut through the noise and spend more of my time on things that matter... the things that I want to be doing.\"\n-@Spriteborne\nGame Designer\n\n\n\"Veteran shoutout for Chris's book Self-Command. Talks about solving a meaningful problem many of us have. If you find yourself struggling to start, I can not recommend it higher. We all know service jacks you up, especially with setting independent, meaningful goals. Check it out\"\n-@RethinkJeff\n\n\n\"Great book (Self-Doubt), even better than Self-Command - A++. Excellent format. Loved the often snappy-answers/reality checks for the quick answer, followed by the longer explanations. Truly great compilation of questions.\"\n-Joe Cassavaugh\nPuzzles By Joe\n\n\n\"As a mid 30's career changer, these addressed deep seated fears I have but didn't really want to articulate. I thought this [Self-Doubt] was great! A lot of value added for me, the answers had some great nuggets of wisdom. Especially because the ask is a little over 2 hours this is an easy recommendation I'd make to others as an addendum or expansion pack for Self Command.\"\n-Jeremiah Franczyk\nMMO Associate Systems Game Designer\n\n\n\"The last part - 'what if I don't see or feel myself making progress?' - was really good. The language is very understandable for me (English is not my first language). The pacing of the speech is spot-on.\"\n-Barış Köklü",

      "description": "Make the most of EVERY second, because when it is gone, you can NEVER have it back!\nWouldn’t it be absolutely liberating if you could decrease your hours and increase your productive output at the same time?\nIs life not too short to waste your precious seconds on unproductive endeavors, feeling stressed, overwhelmed and asking yourself how it is all worthwhile?\nAre you tired of feeling tired, overworked and on the verge of burning out because you have too much to do and to little time in which to do it?\nDon’t you think it is time you win back your life, crush your goals and master your time?\n\n\nYes, yes, yes and YES! Every single person reading the words I have written here are absolutely unique, but I can say with almost perfect certainty that we all share the following:\nWe all said YES as we were reading the questions.\nWe all have only 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week and 52 weeks in a year.\nWe all want to get the most out of life. We want to spend time with our loved ones, reach our professional goals, make time for our extra curriculars and just feel like we are beating the game of life.\n\n\nThis course was designed with the single purpose of empowering you to not only say yes to the abovementioned questions, but also to live yes in answer to these questions. You will learn how to exponentially increase your productivity and manage your time with that perfect blend of effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe course is the culmination of 10 years of personal and professional development, research and personal experimentation, and it is in my opinion, the first step you need to take if you want to take back not only your time, but also your life.\nTime management and productivity is not as simple as learning a few techniques and mindlessly force fitting them to you, your life and your circumstances. Yes the techniques are important and they do work, but in my experience you can only really unlock the potential of these seemingly simple truths about life and time, if you really understand why they and how they work.\nTo really master time management and become a productivity ninja, you need to adopt a mindset not just apply techniques. The best way to foster a new outlook is by means of perspective. The course therefore starts off with background aimed at informing the thinking that will aid you in better using your time. Then once the foundations have been laid, the course dives into proven productivity management techniques and practices.\nThis course is structured in a way that will help you to build your time management mindset and then teach you how to channel your new mental energy into ultra productivity.\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE:\nNOTE: This course is eligible for 5.5 PDU’s\nSection1 serves as introduction to the course and the instructor.\nSection 2 lays the foundation for time management by taking a closer look at some of the core aspects of managing your time.\nSection 3 dives deep into what the course provider refers to as time leeches, the things that steal our time both noticeably and unconsciously.\nSection 4 explores the human factor in time and productivity management. What role does your body and mind really play and how can you get them to work for you instead of against you?\nSection 5 is the big one. Once all the necessary background information has been provided, you will learn the trailed and tested productivity techniques that will help you take your productivity and success to the next level.\nSection 6 covers some final nuggets of truth that can further improve your comprehension of the theory and some additional tips on really maximizing the use of your time.\nSection 7 is a course assessment required for claiming your professional development units.\nSection 8 wraps up the course and send you out into the world with new perspective, ready to win back your time.\n\n\nMESSAGE FROM INSTRUCTOR:\nThis course was created to share with you what took me more than ten years to realize, refine apply and master. I deliberately kept is as short as possible , because at the end of the day time remains our most precious resource and even when applied for the purpose of learning, speed and optimization remains an important requirement.\nI am confident that this course can start you on an absolutely life changing journey and I cannot wait to be the one to get you started.\nSo, time to stop the procrastination and start mastering your time and productivity!\n- Gerrit Fourie",

What’s stopping me?!”\nIf you’ve landed on this page, then something inside of you is tired of your procrastination, sick of your hesitation and READY to finally GO FOR YOUR DREAMS! You have this one precious life and you deserve success, happiness and a deep sense of contentment so you can finally live the life you imagine for yourself.\nIt’s time for you to connect to your purpose, set achievable goals and learn how to stay motivated along the way, and I can show you how.\nMaybe your desire is to build your own online course.\nOr finally lose those nagging ten pounds (again).\nOr put yourself out there - on video - so you can share your vision with the world.\nIf you’re tired of watching others achieve success while you seem to stay stuck in the same old patterns, then this is the course for you.\nI’m Alexa I’m a best-selling Udemy instructor. I’ve taught tens of thousands of students to speak with confidence - on camera, at work, on stage and IN LIFE. As a former actress on hit TV shows like Lie to Me, NCIS and Bones, I have honed a methodology to help people connect with their inner light - something I call their 1000 watt presence - to light up a room and light up your life.\nI’ve shared my expertise on The Today Show and have been featured in publications like Fast Company, Forbes, Entrepreneur and Thrive Global. With over 2,000 five star reviews, my students have shared the impact my insights have made in their life.\n“The teacher is brilliant and the lessons are truly motivational! I am so thankful for this course. It changes your life.” - Luciola Zamprogna, Udemy student\nIn this master class, I breakdown the teaching into three primary areas\nFINDING YOUR PURPOSE\nIDENTIFYING YOUR GOALS\nSTAYING MOTIVATED\nEach section addresses the critical steps for discovering deep insights into exactly what you have secretly wishing to achieve and what’s stopped you in the past. Next, you learn specific exercises to take those insights and put them into action so you finally achieve those lasting results you have always wanted.\nEach lesson is short, inspirational, and specific - with guided exercises every step of the way. In addition to the video lectures, a 70+ page workbook is available with worksheets provided with every lesson.\nIn this master class, I cover:\nFINDING YOUR PURPOSE: Helping you identify the work that matters to you.\nMaking Meaning: Why Finding Your Purpose Matters\nGaining Perspective: How the Messages You've Received Shaped You\nFinding Focus: Dig Deep and Start Discovering\nTaking Action: Your Path to Progress\nIDENTIFYING YOUR GOALS\nDefine It: The Power of Clarity\nSneaky Thoughts: How to Release Negativity\nName It: Your BIG AWESOME Goal\nBreaking It Down: Small Steps Create Massive Results\nSTAYING MOTIVATED\nThe Attitude of Success\nLearn From Others: Seek Advice + Inspiration\nBest Practices For Staying on Track\nPep Talks on Demand (I’ll lift you up when you feel down!)\nEach section includes additional video Question + Answers and I’m always connected to my students as they have questions and comments along the way! Curious to see more, please check out the preview lectures available and see for yourself.\nOne Udemy employee shared that she always watches one of my videos when she feels stuck or overwhelmed to help her go from thinking that “she can’t” to “I can”. That one comment was the inspiration for this course! It was time that I shared my personal tools and techniques to help my students make their big dreams come true.\nThis is your time, my friend. You can do it. In fact, the only regret you will ever have in life is never trying.\nSee you in class!!!",

      "description": "You have a lot of goals and ideas. You are confident they will work. However, finding the time of day to make those goals and ideas happen is close to impossible. Open time quickly gets filled up with other tasks that steal our attention from our best goals and ideas.\nOur time matters. We can either use three hours in a given day to surf the TV or achieve a big goal. For a long time, I struggled with being productive myself. I found myself surfing TV and playing video games throughout the day. Even though I wasn't even a teenager at the time, I knew something had to change.\nI created my first blog before I was a teen. Just like any blogger, I wanted more traffic but never found the time to get the traffic. I blamed it on my \"busy\" schedule which consisted of doing homework, watching TV, and playing video games.\nMy schedule has gotten much busier since then. I have so much homework from advanced level classes and standardized tests that I didn't have time to watch the TV. On some nights, I stayed up past midnight. Not because I played video games and watched TV, but because I put in meaningful work that mattered.\nEven as my schedule got filled with more work, my blog blossomed. I switched over to digital marketing and quickly loved it. My blog now gets thousands of daily visitors and I have emerged as one of the most followed digital marketing experts in the world. I have created over two dozen different products that range from books to training courses.\nThe difference? I stopped making excuses and made my productivity my priority.\nThroughout my journey, I came across some of the best methods to increase my productivity. Those methods are the same reason I am where I am today. Productivity is the key to getting anything done such as writing a blog post or creating your own training course. The more productive you are, the faster you are going to become successful.\n\nIn this course, I will reveal the methods I used to go from being unproductive to writing books, creating training courses, and pursuing the life I want to live while in high school on the cross country and track teams.\nIf you are ready to take your productivity and your life to the next level, then click \"Take This Course\" now.",

      "description": "Learn Easier Study Better was created with middle and high school students, online learners, and adult learners returning to a student role, in mind. Typically these types of students are the ones who most need to learn how to develop their ability to learn independently, boost their confidence in their abilities and basically learn easier and study better. However anyone who feels that they could improve their learning and study abilities will benefit from this course.\nThis course helps these students accomplish exactly this in two main ways. First, it will increase students' meta-cognition. This is the ability to think about one's thinking. Thus students will learn to recognize what it is that they do that helps their learning as well as what they do that hinders their learning. Secondly, this course encourages students to develop a growth mindset. A growth mindset includes perseverance and a \"can do\" attitude. A growth mindset is more indicative of success than IQ!\nIn this course you, you will learn to improve and maintain your motivation and attitude toward learning, understand the learning process, increase your confidence in your learning, and learn an assortment of tricks and strategies to help you learn and study more effectively. This is taught through standard videos, narrated slideshow videos, handouts, reading texts, and key concept visuals. Students will learn through repetition, reflection, and using the three modes of learning (auditory, visual, and kinesthetic).\nIt should take a student 4-5 hours to complete this course. This time lime includes watching the videos, reading and viewing the text materials and doing the handout exercises. The benefits of the work that you will do in this short time will be felt throughout your life!",

      "description": "ADD and ADHD can make it hard to focus & get things done. You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school & career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.\nFor some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT one of those handicaps. ADD & ADHD can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called hyperfocusing, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!\nYou may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get extremely zoned in to one thing (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.\nThe good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually want to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.\nMeditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).\nMany of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!\nBy the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:\n- breathwork\n- mindfulness\n- mindfulness of breathing\n- concentrating on a physical object, and\n- concentrating on an activity,\nYou'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!\nThe skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall & Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?\nDon't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs.

This routine is inspired by the habits of high-achievers such as Oprah Winfrey, Tony Robbins, Tim Ferriss and more.\nIf morning routines are a new concept to you, I will guess that this morning, you grabbed your phone before you even had breakfast. You probably checked your messages, caught up on the news, or checked in to see what your friends had been up to on social media... Fair assumption?\nThe best morning routines are about intentionally preparing your body and mind for the day ahead. They're about protecting your focus and feeding your brain with empowering emotions that will ripple throughout the day.\nIf you want more control over your life, whether it is to beat anxiety, lose weight or simply be happier, you need a solid step-by-step morning routine that activates your brain and energizes your entire body.\nA morning routine is a mere 30 minutes that you can crush daily. It is something that you can look back on and be proud of at the end of the day, no matter how chaotic and turbulent the remaining 23.5 hours might have turned out.\nReady to start the course?

I couldn't compete at work and my grades were never even close to where I wanted them.\nI was getting pretty desperate, so a few years ago I started reading about the psychology of motivation, productivity and procrastination.\nI got a little obsessed with it. I spent hundreds of hours reading and over $700+ on books...\nAnd it took me about a year, but eventually I developed a system to stop procrastinating permanently without forcing myself or using extra willpower.\nNow, I've taken the golden nuggets from that experience and crammed it into a short course you can watch in just a few hours.\nI've done all the legwork for you already, so you just need to watch the course videos to get all you need to escape the procrastination habit for good.\nI discovered there are 4 steps to stopping procrastination, so the course is organized into 4 'Modules' - Watch the first video above where I explain what the 4 steps are and what you need to do to make sure you stop procrastinating.\n\n\nHere's what you'll learn in this course:\nHow to stop using willpower and trying to force yourself to get things done (which just backfires!)\nThe hidden subconscious reason you procrastinate (I take you through an unusual, but effective process to find these reasons).\nA simple-yet-elegant time management schedule that actually works for procrastinators (most scheduling systems work for people with ORGANIZATIONAL problems but are not targeted at the PROCRASTINATION problem).\nHow to stop perfectionism from creating procrastination problems.\nHow to break down projects and goals into almost insultingly-small chunks so they're simple to complete\nHow to manage your energy throughout the day\nHow to prevent burn out\nHow to use time management software effectively, and a selection of the most effective software you can use (but still keep it simple)\nWho is this course for?\nStudents, freelancers and entrepreneurs who have to motivate themselves to work, but constantly get stuck\nStudents with open minds\nAnybody who puts important things off, but isn't sure why\nPeople who are ambitious, but can't find consistency\nWho is this not for?\nAnybody who never puts important things off to the last minute.\nAnybody not willing to change their habits and routines a bit in order to get results\nRemember, if it doesn't work for you, you have 30 days to get your money back with Udemy's Guarantee.\nI don't believe I deserve your money if you aren't absolutely delighted with it, anyway.\nClick \"Take This Course\" now, and I'll see you on the other side!\n- Richard\n-------------------\nThe course has been online helping students for about a year now at StartYourWorkNow-com.\nHere are a few STUDENT EMAILS:\n\"I just wanted to write to you and say how much of a big help your procrastination videos helped me with procrastination. I’ve been to a lot of self-help sites but none of them were quite as helpful as yours. I learned a lot of stuff in listening to your videos and whenever I need a boost in motivation I watch your videos and it’s like magic.\"\n\n- Heidi W.\n\"Hello Richard. Let me introduce myself, my name is Daniel Aljure and I'm a 31 years old online marketer from Bogota (Colombia). I saw your ad in one of my FB profiles and I decided to register myself because I was aware that for a long time (maybe my whole adult life) I've had a procrastination problem that has caused me a lot of negative consequences (although, eventually you learn from everything, and that is a positive consequence itself). Anyway, I tried a lot of stuff, I even hired a business coach that offered to help me and she actually did, but not as much as I needed, and your offer appeared interesting to me and I decided to give it a shot. I have to say now, that it was a very good decision, because I enjoyed the course very much, and I decided to apply most of the stuff contained in the modules. I wanna thank you for that, and congratulate you on a job well done.\"\n- Daniel Aljure, Bogota, Columbia\n\"I watched all your modules a few days and they have given me new hope to break my current pattern of procrastination. It's the best resource I’ve found, and really spoke to me! ...\"\n- A.R., San Diego\n\"Hello there Richard! Firstly, I would like to thank you for this awesome website and the things you’ve shared – they’re amazing. (: ... Your information has given me lots of inspiration.\"\n- Adel R., Singapore\n\"I really like the information! I found this program yesterday and finished watching it just now. I might go through it again, most of the information is new to me. I hope that it will make changes in my work habits. Can’t wait to try the advises! Thanks again!\"\n- Ada M.\n-------------------",

      "description": "After having written over one hundred novels, tens of thousands of articles, and tens of scripts, I have developed a method of breaking down anything and easily writing it in the fastest way possible.\nThis course is designed to make the process more about the writing than trying to figure out what happens next. The number one problem that I have noticed many veteran and new writers have when they either want to write something else, or something new, is that they have always relied on their creativity to get the work down.\nI was like this as well, but I needed more work and I had noticed that I had a natural talent for breaking down articles for different subjects. I applied this to my writing and honed this technique over the years to where I can write 4 80,000 word novels in a month.\nThis course will go over the techniques that I use on a daily basis to deliver entire movie scripts, novels, articles, and even dissertations. This select set of organizational methods will work with any subject and many will find this course is very simplistic by nature, easy to learn and grasp, and is easily deployable in current work.\nThe course is just a little over a half hour, but is so impactful that it will entirely change how most writers go about their work. Each video covers a different part of the writing and is divided between fiction, and nonfiction, to cover both topics.\nIf there was ever a moment where you simply had to take a few days to try and find inspiration instead of actually writing more, this course is most likely for you. It shows you how to find more content within the content that you already have and how to organize the book so that you will almost never have a moment where you need to rely on a moment of inspiration that can take hours to months to have. This is the method I use to have a continous source of creativity and how I am always able to cover any topic that is handed to me.",
      "target_audience": [
        "Anyone who is seeking a way to speed up their writing with proven organizational methods should take this course. This course is for everyone, from an individual just starting to learn how to write to a person who has been writing for years."

That’s why improving time management skills has never been more important to your success.\nIn this Time Management training course, you learn to develop a clear sense of purpose, structure priorities, overcome negative behavior patterns, and leverage practical strategies, tools, and techniques to develop better time management skills.\nTime management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. It involves the balancing of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finite nature of time. Using time effectively gives the person \"choice\" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency. Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to manage time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually, the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any project management as it determines the project completion time and scope.\nThe benefits of learning time management:\nTrain yourself & your team to be proactive, not reactive.\nGet people to stop and think about their time to prevent them from working in auto-pilot.\nImprove yourself and your organization’s productivity by getting people to focus on the most important tasks and then getting them done.\nReduce stress by completing tasks on time and cutting procrastination.\nImprove the quality of tasks completed by ensuring you are not always rushing to finish projects on time.\nImprove work/life balance by ensuring time is used as efficiently as possible. No more working late simply because time was used poorly.\nGet these benefits and more when you use our professionally created time management course.",

      "description": "Document your thoughts like a genius.\nSo why the title?\nWell, take a close look at people we regard as ‘genius’ characters over the centuries. The way they documented their thoughts, took notes, drew and sketched for inspiration and the format they chose when putting pen to paper had a remarkable similarity to what we now call ‘mind mapping’. Doodles, sketches, linking-lines, pictures, images, groupings, relationships; big picture and fine detail. There was less color than the classic modern day mind map, but crayons and felt tip pens were hard to come by, so the humble quill had to sufice.\nThis course is about mind mapping - a slightly more formalised and researched form of note taking, that has huge benefits over traditional note taking or thought documenting techniques.\nMind mapping is being adopted in schools and universities by thousands of students who find this method of note-taking to be amazingly easy and beneficial. These same students take mind mapping into their professional lives to organize, memorize, manage and communicate.\nMind mapping is extremely fast , very intuitive and amazingly easy to re-visit and understand.\nMind mapping can be used by anyone who, at any point in their daily lives, needs to make a plan, take clear and readable notes, or explain concepts or projects to others - everyone including C level executives, management consultants, project managers, engineers, writers, poets, students, designers, teachers, stay at home moms or dads.\nThe uses for mind maps are only limited by imagination itself. Imagine documenting one of Shakespeare's plays - the plots, sub plots, characters, major and minor - the relationship between the characters within the play and even with characters in other of the bards plays. Maybe the relevance of the storyline to a particular time in the life of Shakespeare. To document all this information in a word document for example, might end up as a book in itself. Imagine having all this information on a single sheet, radiating out from a single central topic (i.e the name of the play) - all the information at a glance - imagine using this as the tool to explain every facet of the play to a class of students for example.\nMind maps have awesome power to map, distill and convey information, and explain relationships and ideas in a way the written word cannot. We are visual beings, and a good mindmap gives us an instant picture which is far easier to understand and remember than any other method.\nThis course covers the theory and principles of mind mapping and then gives you an in depth look into the fantastic market leading mind mapping software XMind.\nThe course consists of five hours of video tutorial and supplementary materials and the occasional quiz. Depending on your time commitments, the course can be completed anywhere between a day and a few weeks.",

      "description": "Look, I'll cut the small talk.\nI created this productivity course as a complete resource on time management of productivity for professionals everywhere.\nI've been passionate about time management for over 10 years and placed all that practical experience and documentation into this 3 hour course.\nThere's nobody blocking you more from achieving your goals than yourself.\nAnd it doesn't really matter if we are talking about personal or professional productivity. Goals are goals and achieving or failing to achieve them follows the same principles.\nSo HOW DO I PLAN to get you from \"wanting\" to \"doing\"?\nFirst we go over the productivity of you where we look at things like willpower, motivation, habits, goal setting, decision making and of course your comfort zone\nThen we go over your patterns that include everything you do and how you do it. We look at the 4 quadrants of productivity, at the Pareto principle, analyze the grey zone and the pomodoro technique. We also look at enemies of time management like multitasking, information overload and procrastination\nThen we shift focus from you to building a team, because once you've mastered yourself it's time to grow. We look at recruiting, managing your team, effective meetings, reports and even company culture.\nNearing the end we look at a wide range of productivity tools either focused on maximizing your output by being productive or by making communication more efficient\nThen although not central to business we look at some very influential factors to your productivity like exercise, nutrition, stress, sleep and the people around you.\nAnd we wrap everything up with a simple and actionable battle plan that will allow you to go from knowing to doing\nSo HERE'S MY PROMISE:\nIf you watch this productivity course and APPLY at least one time management technique you learned from it, you will get significant improvement in that area of your life.\nIt's as simple as that. No secret recipe, no magic.\nThe only variable that I have zero control over and you are the only one that has, is YOU TAKING ACTION.\nThat's all.\nRight now you might lack some productivity concepts, tools or strategies to achieve your goals, but after watching this time management course all you'll lack will be ACTION.\nMy ONLY MISSION with this course is to get an email from YOU, 4 weeks from now, saying:\n\"I did that thing you said in Lecture X and got these results. Thank you.\"\nAnd that THANK YOU is MY WIN.\nSo, Enjoy!\nAnd remember what's essential....DOING!",

So when the pandemic hit, I was lucky, because I’d already been there, done that - and the good news is I’d come through it.\nIn fact, learning the right way to work remotely has actually allowed me to be happier, less stressed, more productive and hugely more successful in my work.\nAnd now I want to share with you everything I’ve learned.\n\n\nWorking Remotely: How To Succeed In The New Workplace is your short, sharp introduction to the new way of working.\nIn it, you'll pick up powerful tips and techniques for making your daily work more productive, fulfilling and suited to your personal work style.\n\n\nLearn from someone who's 'been there, done that'\nI’m Dr Clare Lynch, founder and director of Doris and Bertie, a London-based consultancy with a particular expertise in helping teams communicate more effectively.\nThis experience matters because - as you'll discover in the course - being able to communicate effectively with your colleagues is one of the most crucial factors for happy, successful remote teams.\nIn my decades-long career, I’ve worked with executives at a wide range of global organisations - from tech start-ups to global banks to national and international regulatory bodies.\nAs a tutor at the University of Cambridge, and a Udemy instructor since March 2015, I’ve taught over 18,000 students how to communicate more effectively.\nBut above all, as director of my own company, I've worked remotely for over 15 years. And in that time, I've discovered the hard way all the perils and pitfalls of working remotely - such as:\nfeelings of isolation and cabin fever when you're not going into an office every day\nthe risk of being 'out of the loop' on key projects\nfailing to establish clear boundaries between work and home - and so feeling constantly 'on call'\nfeeling demotivated by a lack of a daily regime\nBut in that time, I've also learned the most effective ways to work remotely in order to reap its life-changing rewards!  Rewards such as:\nincreased autonomy during the working day\nmore variety in when and where to work\ngreater scope to pursue creatively satisfying projects\na massive reduction in work-related stress\nspending less on day-to-day travel, food and clothing\nsaying 'Goodbye' to the soul-destroying commute\nWhat you’ll learn in this course\nWorking Remotely: How To Succeed In The New Workplace, covers the key things you need to know if you're considering - or are already - working remotely.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a deeper understanding of remote working - its benefits and the pitfalls to watch out for.\nI'll also be exposing some of the myths that surround remote working and remote workers - like the idea that remote working is the easy option for slackers and slouchers (nothing could be further from the truth!)\n\n\nBecome an expert communicator\nEarly on in the course, you'll be armed with techniques for communicating and collaborating more effectively with your colleagues (and clients), so everyone's pulling together on a day to day basis.\nYou'll also learn ideas and techniques for recreating those 'water cooler moments' that are so essential for bonding with your colleagues, even when you're not going into an office each day.\nArmed with these tips, you'll have a clearer understanding of how to stave off the feelings of isolation that are always a risk when you're working remotely.\nIn this part of the course, you'll also learn how to build a support group of fellow remote workers and expand your network by 'working out loud'.\n\n\nSkyrocket your productivity\nThe autonomy that comes with remote working can be utterly liberating.\nBut the flipside of that autonomy is the strong self-discipline you need to maintain your focus even when you don't have a boss breathing down your neck.\nSo a section of the course is devoted to productivity and motivation. In this part of the course, you'll learn how to beat procrastination and get tons more done - so you don't end up spending all those hours you've saved on commuting trying to catch up.\n\n\nAchieve the perfect work-life balance\nOne of the dangers of working remotely is that the distinction between work and home life can become blurred - leading you to feel like you're always 'on call'.\nThe final part of the course, addresses this danger head on - by considering boundaries and work life balance.\nIn this part of the course, you'll learn how to carve out a working life that makes you happy, productive and fulfilled - without having your work overtake your life. You'll also gain a framework for identifying the times and places where you'll feel most inspired and energised.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to:\nEnjoy the benefits of remote working - while avoiding its perils and pitfalls\n\n\nBanish any feelings of isolation and 'cabin fever' when working remotely\nAdopt the most effective and appropriate ways to stay in touch with your team when you're working remotely\nParticipate in online discussions and video conferences with clarity and confidence\nBeat procrastination, maintain motivation and get more done when working remotely\nChoose the right kit for effective remote working\nProtect your work when working remotely, by following best-practice standards of security\nIdentify the types of workspaces that will make you happiest and most productive - from coffee shops to co-working spaces and more\nCreate - and stick to - an effective morning regime to kickstart your day and set you up for maximum productivity\nCrush those feelings of cabin fever that can set in when you're working from home\nEstablish - and maintain - an evening ritual that will allow you to wind down effectively at the end of the day\nHands-on practice\nThroughout the course, you’ll get opportunities to put theory into practice with exercises and assignments designed to set you up for more effective remote working - from setting your communication goals to reflecting on your work style to creating a timetable for building in everything from deep work to down time.\n\nEnroll now!\nBy the end of this course, you'll be armed with a slew of tips and techniques for being a happy, productive remote worker.\nI can't wait to see you inside the course!",

Learning what to say 'yes' to, and when to say 'no' means getting the right things done. You can achieve more... by doing less.\n\n\nBut, do you find that tiny little word 'no' alarmingly difficult to use?\nDo you worry that 'no' sounds a little bit negative? Or that people won't like you? Or you'll miss an opportunity or something will go wrong if you say 'no'?\nIf that's you, then you need this course.\n\n\nBecause these fears mean that you are no longer in control of your life.\n\n\nLearn when to say NO, and how to say NO\nIf you don't, you'll regret it every time you feel trapped into saying 'yes'.\n\n\nThis course is delivered entirely as high-quality videos delivered by author and professional speaker, Dr Mike Clayton.

Because the Worst Regret in Life is Wasted Time!\"\n\nIf you really need to get things done, and have tried to motivate yourself but still can't be bothered, or you find yourself doing everything else other than your important tasks, then this course is for you.\nThis course is designed to be as short and effective as possible, it only contains proven methods that will immediately help you to stop procrastinating and get things done right now.\n\nSee if you can you relate to the following story...???\nDave needs to finish an important project that he’s been putting off...\nHis thought process starts with...\nOkay, I have to sit down, get all the papers out, will have to do some reading and typing by that time it will be 30 minutes, I only have 40 minutes to spare right now, so by the time I start doing actual work, I will have to pack up...\n\"You know what I’d just rather not think about it right now… instead, let me just quickly check my emails...\"\nEmails to say Dave has Facebook notifications, plus YouTube recommends a video (click) LOL that’s funny reminds Dave of film…. Dave feels like watching something now, and starts browsing Netflix……………..\n45 minutes later of browsing Netflix…… Dave can’t decide on anything good to watch…Arghh\nLooks down at the bottom right of the screen to notice 2 whole hours have just gone past, when Dave said that he had only 40 minutes to spare, Dave feels guilty for putting off the project assignment once again, and he says to himself “I could have done some work all that time!!!... Dave then goes to promise himself \"I'm going to do it tomorrow….” ------------------------\nTomorrow Arrives...\nDave sits down all prepared with the best of intentions to get some work done today...\nBut he feels he just needs to research something quickly online...\nNext thing you know..\nDave finds himself checking email..... followed by Facebook.....then twitter..... Dave then finds himself watching a quick few videos on youtube.... plays a quick game online...... then does some actual work for 10 minutes before Dave feels the need to check email again.... followed by Facebook..... then twitter and emails once again, before coming back to doing some actual work.\nTotal time spent 3 hours, actual time spent doing work 20 minutes...\nDave doesn’t feel so bad because at least he did some work today, but definitely, tomorrow he says to himself…. \"I'm going to do it tomorrow...\"\nDave's story is a funny one that we all can relate to, and every-one of us has their own version of this story,\nHowever…\n\"Imagine waking up one day feeling that you're stuck in a loop and your life is not going anywhere, you feel a midlife crisis coming on and or depression.”\nIf this is a scary thought, think about how drugs can have serious negative consequences over the long term for someone who regularly uses drugs, similarly habitual procrastination can also have serious Life consequences if you regularly procrastinate.\nOne of two things happen when we regularly procrastinate;\n1) In some areas of our life, whether that be financial, relationship-wise or health, can suffer badly because we procrastinate way too often, and break promises to ourselves as well as others.\n2) Or we are always just trying to keep up with life’s chaos, just so we can make it through the week. We don't have time to concentrate on our hopes, dreams, big goals, health, relationships or anything else. We already have far too much going on already, small and big things \"to-do\" that we are constantly juggling in the back of our minds that we have been procrastinating on lately.\nEither way, procrastination ultimately can lead to a day, where you wake feeling that you're stuck in a loop and your life is not going anywhere, this can result in a midlife crisis and or depression.\nThe more you use the \"I'll do it tomorrow\" phrase on a daily basis...The more and more things start piling up quickly, as you try to juggle everything from the unimportant to the important in the back of your mind.\nYou either become scattered all over the place, or you just avoid tasks altogether by not thinking about them until you have no choice but to complete them, but by that time more small and big tasks have already piled up…. including stress and anxiety!!!\nHere's what you may experience the longer you procrastinate on something important that you've been meaning to get done.... first you may start to feel guilty for not completing it, but as the deadline draws near you feel stress and anxiety as more and more small and big tasks start to build up in your mind, its complete chaos and in the end you either fail to deliver on time or you deliver much poorer quality than you could have .\nThis Cycle repeats itself day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year....\nProcrastination does this to the best of us, who always have the best of intentions to get things done.\nSo if you are finding yourself procrastinating too much, you should want to get a handle on it as soon as possible in order to take back control, and to avoid this ultimate depressing outcome and downward spiral.\nBy getting a handle on procrastination and staying on top of things, you'll feel better that you actually did something productive at the end of each day. You’ll feel more in control and organized. You’ll also feel a sense of accomplishment every-time you achieve one of your tasks.\nAs you begin to notice these positive changes starting to happen within your life, you’ll find that more and more doors tend to open for you, you'll be presented with better financial and career opportunities, as well as experiencing better health and having better relationships as a extra side benefit over time.\nThere are many good motivational videos, articles, and speeches to get you motivated. In fact, you may have already read, heard or watched some of these. After a few hours, these things can help you feel motivated for 1hr, 2 hrs or maybe even for the rest of today.\nBut the problems with these types of articles and videos is that motivation is short lived, as it does not provide a clear strategy you can apply to your unique situation immediately or how to track your own personal progress on the tasks you are currently procrastinating on. So as soon as tomorrow comes there's a high chance you'll be back to square one procrastinating again.\nSo this is why I’ve created this video course \"Quick Proven Methods to Help You Stop Procrastinating & Get Your Life Back on Track Starting Today!!!\" This course is created using only the most powerful and proven methods that actually work, that you can learn and apply instantly to your own unique situation to experience immediate progress and long-term transformation.\nBy the end of the course;\nYou'll Feel more Mentally Organized\nYou'll Find Yourself taking Action on your tasks Automatically, without any extra mental effort or needing to spend hours motivating yourself,\nYou'll Feel a Fresh Boost of Mental Energy,\nYou'll Feel More in Control and more Focused than you have been Recently,\nYou’ll know exactly where to start, and in which steps to do your tasks in.\nYou'll find yourself completing your tasks much earlier, and rewarding yourself with extra free time that's stress free to enjoy anything you want to do without worrying about deadlines.\nBefore you know it, you'll back on track ticking off those important tasks that you've been procrastinating on in no time. You’ll feel more fulfillment and a sense of accomplishment every-time you complete one of your big tasks, by doing this you will naturally find yourself moving towards more of what you really want.\nIf you're looking for an in-depth course on procrastination explaining hours of procrastination theory and the science of procrastination, then this course is probably not for you...\nHowever if you're looking for a short effective course, with proven techniques and powerful strategies that you can apply immediately to your very own unique situation, then this course is for you.\nThis video course has been designed differently;\nTo Help you stop procrastinating & get things done starting today, using only the most effective and powerfully proven methods stacked upon one another.\nTo help you get back on track quickly, and help you stay on track for the weeks, months and year ahead.\nWith 8 easy to watch videos, this video course has been distilled to make it as short and effective as possible in order to get you Fast results in your unique situation within the shortest space of time\nEach video is easy to follow along, with step by step instructions that you can apply to your situation immediately as you watch each video or immediately after watching\nNo extensive long hours on the theory of Procrastination or unnecessary repeats, this course is just pure valuable content, with proven techniques and strategies you can apply immediately as you watch, to get you results fast.\n\n\n\n\nTry this course Risk-FREE for 30 days either you’re back on track, mentally organized with more focus and clarity than ever before, making progress and getting things done on autopilot mode, or your money back.\n“Procrastination” is the ultimate thief of time, don’t let procrastination continue to steal your days away from you that you could be using to get to where you really want to be…\n\nBecause the worst regret in Life is wasted time...\nSo click the \"enroll\" button now to get started, as this will be the most valuable investment you can possible make on yourself this year…",

      "description": "Performance Under Pressure - The Full Course includes all the three courses already published:\nThe Right Attitude\nTaking Action\nEffective Human Interactions\n1. The Performance Under Pressure - The Right Attitude section helps you recognize the events and situations that cause you to feel pressure. It explains how you can understand your reaction to pressure, and how excessive stress can impair your performance.\nFinally, it covers the principles for managing your attitude so you stay in control and maintain a success-oriented mentality. Because, meeting high-pressure challenges is an opportunity for you to excel and build your reputation as someone who can be counted on.\nProfessionals and all who want to develop their abilities to manage the stress that comes with working under pressure and anyone who wants to develop or refine their skills for performing under pressure.\nAfter completing this topic, you should be able to:\nidentify the factors that in a situation are likely to trigger pressure,\nrecognize how your response to pressure can impair your performance,\nconduct a stress profile, and\nmanage your attitude in pressurized situations.\nThe section includes video lectures, quizzes, examples and exercises and a small optional course project. All should take you not more than 2 hours to finish.\n2. The second part of a series of three courses on Performance Under Pressure and focuses on Taking Action. And, in this course, you are going to learn not only how to take action under pressure, but also how to avoid over-thinking and over-confidence, and understand what exactly the challenge is.\nActing effectively in high-pressure situations is not easy. Over-confidence can lead to poor judgment, and over-thinking the situation can lead to paralysis. Also, your perception may become clouded by negative thoughts and emotions in times of pressure. But it's exactly at these times that you need to perceive the challenges most clearly so that you can set appropriate goals and take effective action to achieve them.\nThis course sets out some principles to help you avoid the dangers of overconfidence and overthinking, which can impair your performance when under pressure. It then teaches a technique for clarifying your perceptions in such situations and creating an action plan to optimize your performance under pressure.\nProfessionals who want to develop their abilities to manage the stress that comes with working under pressure, and those who want to develop or refine their skills for performing under pressure will benefit from this course.\nAfter completing this section, you will be able to:\navoid over-analysis and over-confidence in high-pressure situations,\nunderstand the challenge in a high-pressure situation from emotional reactions,\nmanage automatic thoughts to optimize perceptions in high-pressure situations,\nuse appropriate steps in the process of taking action in a high-pressure situation, and\ntake action in pressure situations to match every challenge.\n3. The third and last part of a series of three courses on Performance Under Pressure and focuses on Effective Human Interactions. And, in this course, you are going to learn to prevent and deal with negative pressure, manage your reactions, deal with colleagues and stressful situations.\nHigh-pressure environments can be hard on professional relationships. You can so easily get caught up with a major project or looming deadline that your interpersonal skills slip. Under pressure, you may start to make instinctive emotional reactions as your awareness of others' feelings fades.\nThis course helps you develop skills you need to recognize your personal reaction to pressure and how it impacts your relationships with others. It shows how you can consciously control your interpersonal reactions when under pressure and how to avoid unnecessary tensions.\nAnd it details a step-by-step process you can use to stay in control when you're faced with a high-pressure interaction. This all enables you to recognize the importance of professional relationships, and it helps you to stay in control and make the right moves when you're performing with others under pressure.\nProfessionals who want to develop their abilities to manage the stress that comes with working under pressure and anyone who wants to develop or refine their skills for performing under pressure.\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\nunderstand negative reactions to pressure in the workplace and not only\nuse a step-by-step approach for managing your reactions in pressure situations\ndeal with a colleague, a friend or anyone else under pressure\nbe prepared to manage potentially stressful interactions\nThis course includes video lectures, examples, quizzes and some learning support documents, and it will take you not more than 3 hours to finish. And, as usual you have the 30 days money back guarantee, no question asked. (HARVEL-CW95F)\nNow, if this is something that will help you, go ahead and press that \"Take This Course\" button.

These elements are supported by factors such as determination of objectives, environmental analysis, business analysis and performance appraisal. As we have already mentioned, it is not right to say that all of these elements exist in every business, but every organization fulfills these elements explicitly or indirectly.\nIn this course, as an employer or employee, the subjects that we need to know fundamentally for our work, the job to be selected and our current job are explained and taught with video lessons, understandable and applicable information and examples in our business life.\nThe information presented in this course is constantly updated.

Increasing the lessons by continuously adding the information in this course by your teachers, academics and expert technical team requires you to check your course at frequent intervals. This course, which is your lifelong access, will continue to provide you with more up-to-date and different approach.\nBefore looking at what the human resources unit is, it would be correct to look at the word meaning of the concept of 'human resources'. Because when we understand what this concept means, we more or less understand what this unit actually is.\nHuman Resources; It is a business approach that accepts people as a resource and takes people as a basis within the scope of corporate culture. It is an understanding that cares about the relationship between employees and has an innovative management system.\nIn the competitive environment created by globalization, institutions and organizations need human resources in order to do efficient work. For this reason, human resources are becoming an indispensable career department in the global world day by day.\nHuman for institutions; it is now perceived as a resource that uses its potential, rather than just an employee doing his/her duties. This understanding is also accepted in today's institutions and it is starting to move from personnel management to human resources management.\nAs the 'personnel unit' under the responsibility of personnel management leaves its place to the 'human resources unit'; The understanding towards the employee is also beginning to change. Employees are no longer considered just as people who do routine jobs like 'officers', but as a value that can be improved. Employees who used to only do routine work are now consulted to analyze problems and find solutions.\nThe information presented in this course is constantly updated.

      "description": "Are you struggling to keep up with your endless to-do list, feeling overwhelmed by emails, or simply not getting to the tasks that matter most? It’s time to change that! Enroll in this Time Management Short Course and learn proven practical strategies to maximize your productivity, reduce stress, and make time work for you, rather than against you. This course is designed to equip you with the skills and tools you need to not just manage your time, but to take complete control of it, so you can achieve both your personal and professional goals more effectively.\nIn this course, you will discover practical, easy-to-implement methods to transform your daily routine. Whether you're a busy professional trying to balance work and personal life or someone who simply wants to be more organized, this course will help you take the steps needed to regain control. Say goodbye to the chaos of feeling constantly behind and hello to a more structured, productive, and fulfilling day.\nWhat's Inside the Course?\nFocus on Your Most Important Task: Start your day by choosing one important task that will make the biggest impact on your progress. By focusing on this single, high-priority task first, you set the tone for a productive day and ensure that your most important work gets done before distractions arise. This approach helps you build momentum, reduce procrastination, and feel a sense of accomplishment early on, which makes tackling the rest of your day more manageable.\nStop Doing List: Not all tasks are created equal, and some activities are simply draining your energy without adding value. In this lesson, you will learn how to create a \"Stop Doing List\" that helps you identify time-wasting activities and systematically remove them from your routine. This practice alone can significantly boost your productivity and free up time for more meaningful pursuits.\nDon't Break The Chain: Use a simple yet powerful method to build positive habits that stick. This technique helps you to stay consistent and motivated by achieving big results in daily small incremental steps. The results is better productivity and a greater sense of accomplishment over time.\nEmail Best Practices: End email overload once and for all. This lesson will guide you through efficient habits to manage your inbox, minimize distractions, and keep communication flowing smoothly without letting emails dominate your entire day. Learn actionable strategies you can easily implement immediately.\nDo It Now (Quick and Easy Tasks): We often procrastinate on small tasks, and they end up taking up valuable mental space. Learn how to adopt a \"Do It Now\" mindset that allows you to quickly tackle easy tasks as they come up. This simple shift in approach can dramatically reduce clutter, both mentally and physically, allowing you to focus on larger, more important goals.\nFocus on Your Strengths: Discover how to spend more time doing what you’re best at. We will help you identify your unique strengths and show you how to design your schedule in a way that plays to those strengths. By aligning your tasks with what you excel at, you can increase your efficiency, productivity, and satisfaction.\nThe 80/20 Rule: The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 Rule, teaches you how to identify the most impactful 20% of activities that generate 80% of your results. Learn how to pinpoint these high-leverage activities and focus your time and energy on them, allowing you to achieve more by doing less. This powerful principle can change the way you approach work, helping you get maximum results with minimum effort.\nEat The Frog: Mark Twain once said, \"Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.\" In this lesson, you will learn how to conquer your biggest challenges early in the day, so everything else feels easy in comparison. By tackling your most daunting tasks first, you’ll reduce procrastination, gain momentum, and experience a sense of achievement that sets a positive tone for the rest of your day.\nAction Steps to Take Now: Knowledge is only useful if you act on it. This course is packed with action steps that you can implement immediately. Only need one technique to make a big difference and this last lesson encourages you to take the next step.\nWhy Take This Course?\nThis course is designed for busy professionals and anyone who wants to:\nGet more done without feeling overwhelmed.\nEliminate distractions and focus on what really matters.\nMaster simple but effective time management strategies that are easy to implement.\nRegain a sense of control over your daily schedule and create a more balanced life.\nLearn practical techniques that can be applied immediately to both work and personal settings.\nWith practical examples drawn from the instructor's personal and business experiences, you’ll learn exactly how to apply each concept in your own life to see real results.

This system will encourage your desired behaviors and leverage automation when possible.\n\nStep 4 → Implement: This is the technical part of getting your system up and fully functional, transferring any files as needed.\nWhen all is said and done, you will have a proven system that you can use to get your digital life together — and keep it that way.\n\n\nHow This New Course Will Dramatically Increase Your Quality Of Life:\nWhile you probably aren’t fully aware of it, your digital life is a silent chaos that is wreaking havoc on every area of your life.\nThink about it for a second:\nUnlike having a messy room where YOU’RE the one controlling the mess coming in, your digital mess is an entirely different animal.\nYour digital mess will keep accumulating whether you like it or not.\nLook:\nAll of that chaos comes at a cost - to your productivity, your health, and your happiness.\nWhether you like it or not, the endless flood of digital mess and disorganization is taking a toll on your subconscious (and maybe conscious) mind almost every day.\nIn fact, research has shown that our digital interactions are not only distracting us and destroying our productivity…\nThey’re also making us less happy, less healthy, and less grounded.\nPlus, with so much digital noise around us, even if you tried “cleaning it up” in one sitting, you know that you’d just be facing the same unruly mess a few weeks later.\nWith this course, you’ll say “goodbye” to your digital mess for GOOD. You’ll have everything securely backed up and organized, and you can finally be more present without the constant distraction.\nSo join us today to learn how you, too, can achieve Digital Zen.",

Goals are goals and achieving or failing to achieve them follows the same principles.\nSo HOW DO I PLAN to get you from \"wanting\" to \"doing\"?\nWe'll start with your willpower because that's what we lack most of the times. We'll take a look at the science of willpower, how it works and train this \"muscle\".\nThen we go over motivation. But not the old fashion way where all I do is get you hyped. That doesn't last. We analyze your WHY and give you a reason to be motivated.\nMoving on we have your habits. And as the saying goes: \"We first make our habits then they make us.\"\nThe next obvious step is goal setting. Once you have the willpower, motivation and habits to achieve them, it's necessary to make sure they are the right ones. \"You don't want to climb to the top of the ladder of success and realize it's leaning against the wrong wall.\"\nOnce goals are out of the way, we go over your decision making process because this is what most often blocks you or slows you from achieving your goals. And we'll focus extensively on you not lying to yourself, because nobody can exploit your weaknesses more than you.\nAnd last but not least we cover your comfort zone and how you can consistently expand it and achieve bigger and bigger things each time you put your mind to it.\nSo HERE'S MY PROMISE:\nIf you watch this productivity course and APPLY at least one thing you learn from it, you will get significant improvement in that area of your life.\nIt's as simple as that. No secret recipe of productivity, no magic.\nThe only variable that I have zero control over and you are the only one that has, is YOU TAKING ACTION.\nThat's all.\nRight now you might lack some concepts to achieve your goals, but after watching the course all you'll lack will be ACTION.\nMy ONLY GOAL with this productivity course is to get an email from YOU, 4 weeks from now, saying:\n\"I did that thing you said in Lecture X and got these results. Thank you.\"\nAnd that THANK YOU is MY WIN.\nSo, Enjoy!\nAnd remember what's essential....DOING!",

      "description": "Development Methodologies is one of the most widely used programming languages, and following best practices is essential for clean, efficient, and maintainable code. A core best practice is to write clear, readable code. Variable and function names should be descriptive, revealing their purpose within the code. Additionally, consistent formatting, including indentation and spacing, enhances readability and helps other developers understand and maintain the code.\nModularization is the vital practice in Development Methodologies . By organizing code into small, reusable functions and components, code becomes more manageable and testable. Each function should serve a single, clear purpose, adhering to the principle of single responsibility. This modular approach also facilitates debugging and makes the code easier to scale.Error handling is another area where best practices should be observed. Always anticipate potential errors and handle them gracefully with try-catch blocks or by checking conditions before executing critical code. Moreover, logging informative error messages can aid debugging and help in tracking issues without interrupting the user experience.\nDevelopment Methodologies best practices focus on clear, modular, and well-documented code that anticipates errors and maximizes readability and maintainability. Following these principles not only leads to better performance but also fosters a collaborative and efficient development environment.  leveraging JavaScript tools can improve code quality.",

      "description": "UPDATE January 2021: Free Electronic Shorthand dictionary download (find it in Section 6, Lecture 27).\nThe course is in the process of being fully updated. All the replacement & new lectures will be uploaded by the end of January. If you have any requests for additions or clarifications, please let me know.\n=========\nHer name was Angela.\nShe came into my training center, ashen-faced, asking if we taught shorthand.\nWe did ... but when she found out that the quickest course took 40 hours to learn and the shorthand could only be done with pencil (or pen) and paper, she burst into tears.\nOver a coffee, she shared that she was terrified she was about to lose her job as a medical administrator.\nShe was responsible for taking notes during multi-disciplinary team meetings composed of all kinds of health professionals (surgeons, physicians, nurses, nutritionists, physiotherapists, etc.). She had to type the notes on a laptop, while the team members were talking - then produce the notes to be circulated to everyone the next day!\nThat would be a tough job even for a 1950s 160-wpm shorthand-taker.\nFor a harassed administrator with tons of other work to do, bucket loads of stress on her shoulders, and multiple people demanding her attention, it was an impossible feat.\nHer hands shook with the pressure when she tried to type the notes that the medics were calling out to her. She gave up completely when they started talking over each other.\nShe was on anti-anxiety medicine from her doctor.\nHer Line Manager had called her in to ask if she was up to the job. He said she was starting to look like a rabbit in a car's headlamps.\nShe was at the end of her tether.\nBudgets had been slashed, there were no secretaries to take the notes; security/confidentiality was tight, there was no option to write 'proper' shorthand on paper that could possibly be lost, she had to use the encrypted laptop; jobs were scarce, there were other people waiting in the wings for her to screw up, to take her job.\nWhat could I do to help?\nI had learned shorthand back in high school (when I had wanted to be a reporter - I ended up in PR, journalism's little brother!). And I taught several shorthand systems in our training center. But Angela didn't have 40 hours spare to learn, and she wasn't able to use pen and paper during meetings. Traditional shorthand wasn't going to help her.\nI rang a friend who taught journalism. Surely they had faster ways of learning shorthand?\nNo. They didn't even teach it anymore. They advised students to try to find courses in community colleges. Most couldn't find any and generally tried and failed to learn from books.\nBut he also said something interesting ...\nLots of reporters had switched to using electronic devices for note-taking. He said a method of taking fast notes on an device or laptop was sorely needed.\nI set to work to invent something new.\nMy first system - created to prevent Angela's nervous breakdown - wasn't perfect but it enabled her to type quickly and produce comprehensive meeting notes without it taking up her whole day. It eased her stress and saved her job.\nHer efficiency and serenity also impressed - and surprised! - her colleagues and managers.\nI worked on the system over the next two years, working out kinks, refining and honing down the method to the four simple steps that it is today.\nIt is now used by:\nReporters when out in the field - and then back at their desks, transcribing audio recordings faster than their colleagues could believe was possible! They even use it in a way I hadn't thought of ... pen and paper! They aren't allowed to take devices into courtrooms, so they simply use electronic shorthand on paper, then type it up when they get back to their desks.\nCollege/University Students - taking notes during lectures helps keep them awake and alert. Note-taking is known to improve concentration and focus. It also gives them valuable tools for revising. Many use the Cornell system with electronic shorthand, to further improve understanding/recall.\nHigh School Students - this method helps in schools, too.\nOnline course takers - taking notes improves understanding and memory. It's too easy to just watch/listen to a course and not be actively involved. The act of jotting down important points really helps with learning.\nBusiness people - lawyers report their satisfaction at being able to take extensive instructions from clients; entrepreneurs love having the ability to jot down ideas as fast as their brains come up with them!; attendees at conferences and trainings find that they are very popular with colleagues, because they have extensive notes of all the good stuff.\n\n\nDo you wish you knew how to do shorthand?\nWe all have smartphones, tablets, and/or laptops now and those squiggles don't transfer to electronic devices. Yet the ability to do digital note-taking has become more and more important to many of us.\nPerhaps you need to take fast, accurate notes for your job; maybe you're a student who would love to be able to get down more of what a lecturer/professor is saying during lectures; or you could be one of the thousands of people who struggle with their memory or concentration.\nThe ability to take notes quickly and accurately is a valuable skill. It's brilliant for journalists and students, of course, but it is also a huge bonus to anyone who enjoys studying online courses, attending webinars, or just jotting down ideas. It is also a vital skill for professionals who need to take instructions from clients. It makes the workload easier and the stress lighter.\nWhile traditional shorthand takes many, many hours to learn, this course in electronic shorthand will take you just couple of hours of study and practice to become comfortable with the system. Then it's just of matter of adding to your own personal abbreviations dictionary (included in the course) and building your speed naturally as you use your new skill.\nIt's fun, useful, and great for the ego to learn this skill because you'll be thrilled you picked it up so quickly.\nThis course is designed to help you learn quickly and easily and enable you to take notes on any device that has a keyboard or onscreen keyboard.\nIt is taught via four main 'Super Simple Rules' with activities, quizzes, and dictations throughout. There are also tons of downloadable materials in the form of worksheets, dictionaries, and PDFs. Unlike traditional shorthand methods, there isn't a whole new language to learn. My digital note-taking method uses the alphabet - which you already know if you're reading this!\nIt is a little like the 'text' language so many people use on smartphones, where they leave the vowels out. But try reading back some text language, it's like gobbledy-gook! That's not something you want to risk if you are taking important notes.\nThis method teaches simple principles of which letters to leave out and when, then adds in other principles to make sure that you will be able to read back everything you write using digital note-taking, even if you come back to it six months or a year or more later. Even master shorthand practitioners can't always do that!\nYou'll love it!\n\n\nEnrolling in this course will:\nEnable you to learn a new skill - quickly and easily.\nGive you the ability to write notes on an electronic device MUCH more quickly than you could using the standard alphabet.\nEnable you to increase your note-taking speed and accuracy as you use the skill in your everyday life.\nImprove your productivity - being able to take all the notes you need to and knowing where to find them can ease stress, improve concentration, and give you better recall and understanding.\nCopyright (c) 2018 Michelle Campbell-Scott All rights reserved",

      "description": "In Writing Productivity Habits, a course for self-published authors, I will show you the steps you need to take in order to increase your writing productivity.\nYou will learn Planning Habits, to ensure that you are writing regularly; Writing Habits, to ensure that you write quickly, Learning Habits, to ensure you stay ahead of the curve in your niche or genre and finally Health-related Habits, to ensure that you remain healthy and avoid a sedentary lifestyle.\n***** Last UPDATED in November 2017 *****\n\nWrite More Books Each Year Using the Methods Taught in this Comprehensive Course\nEver wonder how some self-published authors manage to write as many as 10 books each year, while you are hard pushed to publish even a couple?\nOr are you a part-time writer, struggling to balance your writing career with your regular day job?\nWriting productivity really is a key component towards whether or not you will ultimately be successful as a self-published author.\nThe more books that you are able to write, the more promotional opportunities are available to you and the better chance you have of making a substantial income from your writing.\n\n\nA Simple Formula For Increasing Your Writing Productivity\nWhen you think about it, a simple formula for writing productively could be:\nThe amount of time you actually get to sit down and write multiplied by the number or words you are able to write in any given session.\nIn the course we’ll look together at how you can find the time during your busy schedule for your writing. And also how you can increase the number of words you write each time you sit down at your desk.\nIn the section on Planning Habits, you will learn:\nHow to plan your time effectively, so that you are able to dedicate certain periods of time to your writing, each and every day.\nHow to create a medium to long-term strategy for your writing\nHow to best manage a part-time career as a writer\nWhy writing daily is so important\nHow to plan your daily work schedule\n\n\nIn the section on Writing Habits, you will discover how the writing tool, Scrivener, can help transform your whole mindset towards writing. And in particular, I will show you:\nThe importance of writing quickly\nHow I personally increased the number of words I write every day\nHow Scrivener can help you increase your own writing productivity through Distraction Free Writing, Project Statistics and The Setting of Writing Targets\n\n\nAlthough this course is primarily focused on writing productivity, it is also concerned with productive habits for self-published authors in general.\nIt is important that you do not neglect non-writing tasks, which are important in your life as a self-published author, and so I will also show you how you can incorporate marketing, learning and even health-related tasks into your daily routine.\n\n\nAt the end of each section of the course, I have included:\na Quiz - to test your knowledge of what you have just learned\na PDF - with links to the resources and tools mentioned in the section, as well as some further reading on the topic.\na Task Sheet - which sets out a number of tasks for you to complete in order to practice what you have learned.\nAnd by completing the quizzes, the extra reading material and the tasks I have set, I believe you will take even more from the course than if you just sit and watch it, so I highly recommend that you do so.\n\n\nBy the end of this course on writing productivity habits, you will be in a better position to write more books each year and will also be more focused in achieving success in your career as a self-published author.",

He made a lot of sense about how to be productive and how to get started on the goals you want to accomplish! This really helped me in a lot of ways and I can't wait to get productive and start my goals in life! Thank you Jellis Vaes for such a energizing and wonderful course! This was an awesome one and hope you make more like it!\" - Jane Courtois\n\"The course is interesting. I was aware of only some of the techniques, software and guidelines, so I am now that more closer to being more productive :) \" - Yuriy Protsiuk\n\"I highly recommend this course. The material is presented in a concise fashion, and the instructor is a great & fun teacher. I love the practical nature of all the tips. You can implement them right away, and with some small changes in habits, you can completely change the way you work. I have implemented the tips and have really improved my productivity and feel so much more on top of my work now.\"  - Filip VH\n\"This is a very engaging course, especially if you like to take notes. One of the highest quality courses I've taken thus far. It touches on very real things that I was not aware of, while offering solutions to each problem.\" - Daniel Hensley\n_________________________________________________________\nDo you want to become extremely productive?\nGreat! Then let me welcome you to the course: The ULTIMATE Time Management & Productivity Course.\nIn this productivity and time management course from The IPS Project, taught by Jellis Vaes, you will learn how to truly master your time.\nThis is the course where you will not only learn about the killers of productivity and what to do to avoid or get rid of them, you will also learn the most fundamental productivity tools and techniques, as well as a system to put it all to use — namely, The Action Plan.\nThe system of The Action Plan is designed to keep you disciplined, motivated, and to give you a clear map towards achieving your vision and your goals.\nThis system that you are about to learn — mainly directed at entrepreneurs, freelancers, those who are self-employed, or anyone else working on big projects and goals — is one that I have designed and formed out of various systems from other highly successful businesspeople.\nWhat makes this course different from so many other courses on productivity is the fact that it is less focused on the theoretical and more on the practical side. Yes, indeed, this is a course that you can actually do something with.\nMeaning that, by the end of this course, you will know the tools, techniques, and the system that you can start using immediately to become extremely productive and to be able to start achieving your goals, projects, dreams, and the life you are trying to build.\nWith that, let me not waste any more words here. Let us begin. The course itself will speak loudly and clearly enough of its own value.\nNote: The Action Plan is a highly efficient system to help you along the process of achieving your goals and dreams. Obviously, though, you still have to sit down and do the work yourself. It can’t do that for you. Nothing can. Only you.\nThroughout the course, be sure to take notes so you can more easily review everything you have learned.\nHave fun becoming a productivity master,\nJellis V",

      "description": "Welcome to the course ‘Liberate Your Performance- Karuu’. This course aims to make you a Magnet for Results.\nWe all have same amount of time. People who were successful had the same number of hours available to them, just the way it was for the people who were unable to do anything in their lives. The only difference was the productivity of their time, the amount of value they created in their available time. The successful people put their best to get outcomes from their time, while losers keep inquiring “Where did all the time go?”\nWe all know about the people who work hard and seems to put their best, but they are unable to get results. What is happening there? They should be getting something for their efforts, but if our endeavors are not leading to required outcomes then it is not adding any value to anyone, not even them. These people are not productive and they cannot manage their time to generate value. We know that value and success are directly related to each other. This equation is valid for all types of success definitions.\nAs our daily quota of energy and time is limited, we must focus our attention on the required action to get results.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTime is constant and equally available to everyone, but some utilize it to achieve success in their lives, while others watch it passed by. Time never stops, it keeps moving forward with constant speed. We have the option to either utilize it or waste it without extracting value out of it. People who are unable to find success in their lives have common pattern of managing their time. They do not utilize it to get concrete results, which can push them forward.\nIn-depth research and observation of successful people have been instrumental in developing this course. We found that the ability to get results is the necessary factor for getting success, whatever it maybe. Everybody has their unique definition of success which requires their own contextual outcomes. For example, the business success for an entrepreneur can be to gain market share and for a doctor it can be to save lives and reduce pain. That is also the difference between failure and winning. Winners get results by utilizing their energy and competences in the right way.\nThe objective of the course “Liberate your performance – Karuu” is to create a personalized performance system for the learners so that they achieve the required outcomes in an efficient and effective way. People can represent the Performance System with different expressions like Time Management System and Productivity Enhancement System. We will explain the basic philosophy of Karuu and would guide you to develop your own system or techniques to enhance your performance.\nWe have attached a workbook to facilitate the learning of the concepts and to develop your performance system on the template of Karuu. You will also find several posters of important concepts, attached with different sections.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE\nAre to\nTo understand the concept of Performance Management and its myths.\nTo know about your own productivity and identify the problem areas.\nTo understand Karuu system, which can help you to make you a doer, a person who get things done.\nTo design and refine your own personalized performance system.

Find out in The Book Factory!\n• Is life getting in the way of you completing that novel?\n• Ever think there’s not enough hours in the day to find time to write?\n• Have a full time job distracting you from your real passion of being a novelist?\n• Are family responsibilities weighing you down and interfering with your writing goals?\nI’m here to tell you that YOU CAN DO IT ALL and DO IT SUCCESSFULLY!\nIn 2009, I successfully managed one husband, two jobs, three children, a difficult pregnancy, AND still managed to write twelve books, sell ten of those books (including all the editing and promotion), and coped with other various life challenges thrown in just for fun!\nHow did I do all of that and still find time to eat and sleep?\nI developed a method of writing known as “The Book Factory Method\"--that's how! It does require commitment and desire to get it done, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you can produce multiple books in one year.\nWhat’s the benefit of completing multiple books in one year?\nThe more books you have ready to submit, the more chance you’ll receive contract offers on one or more of those books. Or, the more books you can independently publish and get those consistent (passive) income dollars rolling in.\nWhy shouldn’t you just focus on one book and continue polishing that book all year long?\nThe cold, hard truth is that you might not ever sell that one specific book. You should always have more than one project in the works at any given time.\nAre you one of those writers who starts multiple projects but never finishes any of them?\nThen this class is for you as well. We’ll talk about how to finally see those projects through to completion.\nHave trouble with time management or procrastination?\nWe’ll address methods for getting organized and staying focused. Plus much, much more!\nIf you want to learn how to get started, stay on track, and get those books ready to submit…this workshop puts a method to the madness of novel writing.\nWHAT'S INCLUDED WITH THIS COURSE?\n1.

      "description": "What this Course is All About\nIt is sometimes difficult for us to be able to get on top of all of the things we need to do. Even worse than this we end up filling our days with useless tasks in order to feel busy but at the end of the day we still feel inside that we've achieved nothing. I've used my own simple tools, all of which are available online or can be created with a simple pen and paper, to achieve an incredible amount of progress in the last two years. I want to share with you today how you can work less and yet achieve more than you ever have before. These techniques will help you to get your life moving in the right direction without giving up your personal life.\n\n\nThe Best Part?\nI'm going to show you how I managed to cut my work down to four hours per day or less and never work weekends while still being able to achieve the following in the last 18 months:\n\n\n- I became an author, publishing my first book\n- Built a suite of courses on Udemy\n- Created a business selling high end courses to businesses\n- Created two websites that receive a combined 20,000 visitors per month\n- Automated my business income and increased it while working less.\n\n\nWhat Can I Expect?\nI will give you all of the tools you need in order to simplify your work flow, while increasing productivity. This means that if you still want to hustle and work 12 hours a day, then your success will go through the roof. However if you want to work 4 hours a day and spend the rest with family, like me, then you can at least 3x your output with half of the time.",

      "description": "To start off, let me ask you a question: What are mind maps to begin with?\nStarting with the brainstorming:\nWe all know how important it is to brainstorm. Whether you have a school project, a product launch, a job interview, a presentation, or any type of learning material you want to emphasize or present, brainstorming is the first step to take.\nYou want to gather as many ideas as possible, details and information. Then you want to organize them properly, and finally, draw a guideline out of them.\nIt is one thing to brainstorm and have numerous ideas rushing through your head. It is another thing to put those ideas on a piece of paper, and it is an absolutely different thing to mind map those ideas.\nHere is another way to look at it:\nMind mapping can be also known as “clustering ideas”. It is a way of collecting and grouping certain ideas focused on a specific topic and defined by correlated connections.\nLet’s explain the concepts more:\nWhat you will be doing, is representing those ideas visually, for your personal and interpersonal presentation and understanding. The way toward making a mind map is more creative and engaging than a standard diagram or table; the visual quality licenses clients to feature and audit key focuses effectively and more rapidly than with standard arrangements of notes.\nThey also encourage review, on the grounds that the relationship of thoughts reflects the manner in which the cerebrum works.\nSome of the main guidelines for mind maps is that you need to avoid criticism and throw in as many ideas and thoughts as possible. You also need to expand your cognitive horizon by thinking in an exaggerated creative way. This is where originality starts. Mind maps are built around a cluster of random yet specific ideas, to be later on organized through the mind mapping process.\nI’ll give you a simple metaphor of mind mapping. The idea you are trying to develop is in your mind. Once you start mind mapping, an explosion happens, a Big Bang.\nAt first, nothing makes sense, ideas being tossed around randomly just like atoms were tossed around randomly when the Big Bang happened.\nThen what? You start organizing your ideas, coordinating the correlation, making sense out of it, this is where planets started to form, galaxies were built, the universe started to work in a coherent matter.\nThen you get to the end, you finished your mind map. This is the part where life started on earth. Lastly, you need to execute, this is where revolution took place. The pinnacle of the evolution of the evolution of us, human beings, and to reflect upon mind maps, it is getting to the end result of your mind map after following the execution plan.",

And usually these are folks who set goals that are almost impossible NOT to achieve.\nWhy don't more people achieve their goals? It's not like we set out to fail. It's not that there aren't plenty of plans.\n2 Out of 5 Is Bad\nWhen it comes to goals most people take 2 out of the 5 steps critical for achievement.\nStep 1: Set the goal and write it down.\nStep 2: Create a plan and follow it.\nThat's not enough. It never has been.\nIt sounds like enough. It's logical. It makes sense. But it simply doesn't work for most people.\nWhy?\nSteven Pressfield calls it resistance.\n“Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance. Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were mean to be? Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.”\nResistance is what keeps us from our goal.\nAnd get this...\nWriting the goal down & making a plan will NOT defeat it.\nIntroducing...\n5 Stones : Slay Your Giant Goals!\nThis program is designed to help you tap into the power of the 3 goal achievement components that have been virtually ignored.\nWith 5 Stones you will...\nDiscover the FIVE essential stones of achievement.\nTap into the strength of the 3 essential stones that every program on the planet ignores.\nLearn the three roadblocks you face with ever goal you pursue.\nFace the #1 reason you and billions of others may never reach a particular goal. Conquer this and every goal is virtually guaranteed.\nUse a simple system to stay focused and on fire.\nAnchor your Firestones so you can generate motivation and momentum at will.\nLet's admit that within a few days of setting a goal our passion drifts. What will happen when it doesn't?\nFinally set, track and accomplish the goals you set out to reach.",

What began as a simple college lined notebook that I used to plan my goals has turned into my mission to helping as many people as possible find their TRUE PATH and to start living the life they’ve always wanted by being more productive, healthier and happier!\nThe system is \"TRUE PATH\" a 13-week all-in-one goal setting guide that is designed to give you Direction, Structure, and Accountability. It does this by assessing what you really want in life (Goals), and then developing, defining and breaking those goals down into manageable monthly, weekly, and daily action steps.\nSetting 13 week goals gives you the ability to see the finish line. Goals are like staircases…you don’t get to a staircase, take one step, and you are at the top. You need to take one step at a time, and before you know it, you are at the top…same with goals. Breaking your goals down and having that 13 week mark allows you to see the top clearly. This also allows each step (daily/weekly) to have more impact on your journey giving you more motivation to keep climbing.\nThis 13-week system was designed using neuroscience principles which allows you to get the most out of your day, week, month and life through learning about yourself, how habits are developed and changed, as well as learning to strengthen your brain through mindfulness practice which increases your mood, memory, focus, emotional intelligence and immune system while decreasing stress and anxiety.\nWhen you complete the 13-weeks of TRUE PATH, you will have a new perspective, not just on your goals, and what you want in life, but a better understanding of yourself and how YOU work from day to day.",

      "description": "Description\nKnowing how to negotiate effectively, and with confidence, is a skill that can make a huge difference to your career, your day-to-day work life and your personal wellbeing. Whether it’s negotiating the starting salary for a new job, getting that pay rise you know you deserve, agreeing on deals and contracts with suppliers and customers, or dealing with a difficult colleague - knowing how to negotiate properly is essential in every single area of work. Negotiation is everywhere - in our private and professional jobs, we sometimes negotiate without even knowing it. As sociable beings, negotiation is part and parcel of the way humans interact, so it’s well worth mastering.\nThe Course is a guide to create and becoming a Great Leadership Talent developed by the flagship competency development framework of Great Leaders Institute and HandE Learning. The important business communication processes will be covered in a step-by-step approach for all management professionals to nurture and develop the most important organizational, leadership and managerial communication, approaches and business transactional activities.\nThe course has engaging video lectures, real life examples, case study analysis and different frameworks for the leadership development. The proper structure and process of leadership development is explained in the most easy and short way for the learning of the individuals.\nUsing tried and tested techniques, this course will give both clarity and efficiency to the way you go about negotiating. Not only will you learn how to structure a negotiation correctly, but you will also be taught about the concept of collaborative negotiation, which hinges on understanding the other person’s feelings and viewpoints.\nThe negotiation skills you will develop during this course will allow you to head into intense discussions without stress or worry. You’ll become a master of the art of negotiation and learn practical insights that can be applied throughout your life (including outside of work!), whether that’s buying a new home or selling a car.\nOf course, money is often the focus of many negotiations, and small wins can make a huge difference to your organization's performance and how seriously you are taken in the workplace. Maybe you need to be stronger in contract negotiations, or tow a harder line in procurement? Perhaps you’re getting passed over for promotions, or you feel like new and exciting opportunities are passing you by. Poor negotiation is a weakness that can be taken advantage of, but this course you will turn your negotiation skills into a superpower.\nThe course is useful for both Individual professionals and Organizations for the leadership development process, management communication or client communication. The methodical approach can be implemented to any size and nature of organization. The course explains the method, framework, and process in a structured manner.\nBy the time you finish this course, you will have developed fundamental skills that are essential to successful negotiation. You’ll know how to enter negotiations from a position of strength, and how to navigate your way to an effective result. First, we’ll cover the basics of negotiating, then we’ll apply these principles to real-life examples using a step by step process that you can use in any situation. These practical skills will spill over into all aspects of your life, allowing you to know your worth and how to leverage negotiations for a win-win outcome.\nThe course overview includes:\n· Complete step by step approach to learn Negotiation.\n· The basic concept and process of Negotiation\n· Applying negotiation theory to 8 real-life work scenarios\n· Planning your negotiation toolkit and Processes\n· Setting your Walk Away Point and better understanding.\n· How to make a suitable Opening and closing Offer\n· 21 Different Negotiation Tactics, Styles\n· Negotiation style assessment and a complete behavioral interpretation\n· Getting a pay rise, or negotiating your hiring salary\n· How to negotiate when either buying or selling at work\n· Role based negotiation as a Recruiter, Salesperson, Project Manager, People Manager\n· Creating a non-confrontational conversation between a difficult colleague or boss\n· Common techniques that will be used against you - and how to combat them.\n· How to rid yourself of excuses and worries around negotiating\n· Simple negotiation phrases that will get you a brilliant price.\n· And lots, lots more!\n\n\nFramework\nThe first steps of the course will focus on perfecting your negotiation strategy. This will involve an appreciation of the ‘power of variables’. Within this section, you will be taught exciting new concepts such as ‘the WIN matrix’ and all common principles of negotiation that will have you haggling and bargaining like the very best!\nThe middle of the course will be focused on the concept of discussion. There are a lot of different exercises within this section to fully solidify your understanding of how to maneuver a negotiation in the direction you want it to go. By putting this together, you will then know how to create a discussion agreement statement – an excellent tool that gets you exactly what you want during the negotiation process.\nAs well as focusing on other negotiation phases and tricks, examples including proposing and agreeing, the course will focus on the psychology of dialogue, and how you need to overcome yourself before persuading someone else to agree to your conditions.\nBy concluding with a list of common pitfalls that negotiators trip themselves up on, this course is truly a robust source of negotiation knowledge that will help you master the art of persuasion with ease and clarity.

It's when you know you should do something but still don’t do it. And why don't you do it?\nSimple. At some level you believe that taking the action to do the task right now, will be more painful than putting it off. Its not life threatening when we put something off is it? At the time it doesn’t seem to be all that important. And at the end of the day, if you have let a few things slide that’s OK isn't it? I mean it doesn’t seem such a bad day does it? But if you keep piling these days up it can become a disastrous year and after that a disastrous life.\nYour attitude about procrastination is totally changeable and controllable. Its all a matter of choice.\nYou can choose to be PROACTIVE or DEACTIVE. And what do we mean by that? This is covered in detail in the course.\nIts all about taking action\nEverything we have around the world started with a thought or an idea, but that thought or idea only became something because someone took action on it. An average idea which is actioned is 100% better than a great idea that never gets actioned and subsequently dies with no follow up.\nThis is an amazing program and beating procrastination is an integral part to success, fulfilment and happiness. By the end of this course you will understand the true nature of procrastination, openly analyse the negative effects that long term procrastination has had on you, discover that it is just too costly to put up with any longer and we will give you some tools and strategies to change this pattern and leave procrastination behind so that you can Live your life to the Max.",

      "description": "The module actively defines and dwells on the definition and the implementation of the concept of Adaptive Leadership in particular. It manipulates and addresses the need of the leadership in style of framework and deviation on ground which delivers the new age spectrum of challenges and approaches of the uncertain and taking immediate decisions out of the stream keeping the experiential venture in view. Adaptive leadership is a leadership approach that focuses on navigating and thriving in complex and rapidly changing environments. It was developed by Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Adaptive leadership recognizes that traditional leadership models may not be sufficient to address the adaptive challenges that organizations and societies face today. Here are key principles and concepts associated with adaptive leadership:\nDistinguishing between Technical and Adaptive Challenges:\nAdaptive leadership begins by distinguishing between technical challenges and adaptive challenges. Technical challenges have known solutions and can be addressed with existing knowledge and expertise. In contrast, adaptive challenges are complex, often lack clear solutions, and require organizations and individuals to adapt and learn as they confront them.\nLeadership as a Process, Not a Position:\nAdaptive leadership views leadership as a process that can come from anyone within an organization, not just those in formal leadership positions. It encourages distributed leadership, where people at all levels take on leadership roles to address adaptive challenges.\nRaising the Heat:\nAdaptive leaders understand that addressing adaptive challenges often involves \"raising the heat\" by confronting the discomfort and resistance that come with change. This can involve challenging long-held beliefs, norms, and practices.\nManaging the Work Environment:\nAdaptive leaders create a safe environment where people feel empowered to experiment, learn, and adapt. They manage the work environment to foster a culture of innovation and risk-taking",

      "description": "Do you have a system for taking notes?\nDo you have a system for organizing your notes?\nCan you reliably find notes you took on a book or at a conference from 5 years ago?\nWhat about a creative idea you had 5 years ago?\nFor most people the answer is no.\nFor most people, they would have a very hard time finding something from 5 months ago, or even 5 weeks ago.\nAccelerated learning is about becoming more efficient in your learning.\nBut another way to look at is just a methodology so that you stop wasting huge amounts of time.\nAnd one way we waste time is that we come up with the same ideas over and over again because we never write them down.\nOr we write them down, but then we never do anything with them.\nYou may have heard about the idea of an ideas bank before.\nOr something similar. A place to keep all your random notes in one place.\nBut it turns out that if you consistently do this for months and years, you end up with the equivalent of a spreadsheet with 10,000 + rows.\nYou may have started out thinking you would look over your list of ideas every month for 10 or 15 minutes. But after a year or two, it's more like 3-5 hours to read a list that long.\nIt's not a SUSTAINABLE system.\nIt turns out that the only smart way to use an ideas bank is to get stuff out of the ideas bank as quickly as possible.\nIt's called project based thinking.\nAny idea that you have, at least 95% of them, are actually ideas that belong in a larger project of some kind.\nYou may not have a project set up yet, (and if you aren't sure how to do that, check out my vol 8 course in the learning the hard way series and my course on one pagerr project management) but that doesn't change the fact that most of the ideas you have are really just leaves on a tree. And that tree is a project.\nEach project is a tree. And each idea you get is a leaf.\nYou need an ideas bank so you can get those \"bags of leaves\" that you collect in your phone or notebook or sticky notes and get them on the right tree where they belong.\n\nThat's why this course isn't just about building a place to store stuff and then never look at it again.\nThe ideas bank is the HUB of a larger system.\nThis system is design for keeping your micro-notes well organized.\n\nIf you've taken my courses on note taking and learning projects organization and information organization, you know how to organize your information. But only when it is a known quantity.\nWhat about all those micro notes that don't fit into that system easily?\nThat's what the ideas bank is for.\nIt's kind of like the huge sorting facilities that UPS uses.\nAll the packages in a region get sent to a central sorting facility, and then they get shipped off by truck or plane to their destination city.\nThe ideas bank is that hub that will bring everything in one place so you can then send it off to it's final location.\nFuture courses in this series will cover specific types of structured notes you can keep for things that don't fit neatly into existing categories. For example, a mistakes journal, dream journal, physical object inventory, intellectual property inventory, etc.",

He gets right to the point which allows me to learn a lot in a short span of time! His course content, text visuals, and presence is so engaging that I find myself feeling more energized after watching his videos. I highly recommend this course and instructor!\" - Rachel Shriver, Udemy student\n\n\nJoin internationally renowned coach and top-rated Udemy instructor TJ Guttormsen as he shares the productivity techniques used by Fortune 500 CEO’s, Olympic athletes, and overachievers around the world.\nIn this 97-minute, no-fluff course, TJ will walk you through several of the most efficient productivity techniques and habits he’s learned, used, and taught through his work with world-class high-performers over the last decade.\nTJ’s thousands of students have ranged from billionaires and award-winning artists to entrepreneurs, creatives, homemakers, the regularly employed, the under-employed, and basically everyone else. And these techniques have served them all well.\nHis other courses on Udemy have several times been the highest-rated courses in their categories, and the positive feedback from students getting real-world results keeps flowing in.\n\n\n\"Excellent content and presentation. Well structured and easy to follow. As on all TJ's courses there are suggestions of activities easier to implement that could make an impact on our life. Highly recommended!\" - Doina Munteanu, Udemy student\n\n\nWhat you'll learn.\nThe content of this course is applicable both to your professional and your personal life, and most of the techniques can be used in both areas. Some are also specifically designed to improve the efficiency of your workspace, or cut down on the time and energy you spend on routine, everyday tasks at home.\nThe things you’ll learn include:\nHow to stay fully focused on the work you’re supposed to be doing.\nHow to reset your brain between tasks in order to keep it working at its best.\nHow to be “lazy” and get more done by working smarter, not harder.\nHow to use “chunking” to organize your day better.\nHow to optimize your surroundings and the external stimuli that help you perform at your best.\nHow to overcome procrastination – no matter what’s causing it.\nAnd lots more.\nIt doesn’t matter what your life looks like today. If your goal is to be more efficient, more focused, or more productive - to get more things done in less time with better results – this is the class for you.\nThe techniques and habits you'll learn are uncomplicated and easy to use. They require very little energy, time, and effort to work - otherwise, they would defeat their own purpose!\nThere are no complicated models, intricate interconnected bits and pieces, or abstract philosophies you have to learn and practice to make this work. Each chapter is fast-paced, with clear explanations for how to use the techniques. And many of the chapters have practical exercises that will help you apply them to your life as well.\nNearly all of these techniques are plug-and-play. Once you've watched the course, you'll be able to apply them instantly to any kind of task or work.\nYou'll also be offered a way to interact directly with TJ, who will personally help you with any questions you have about what you're learning.\n\n\nSo if you're ready to make your life even more productive from now on - sign up now.\n\n\n\"I initially gave 4 stars because the advice seemed too basic at first. Then I decided to come back to give a 5-star rating after trying some of the techniques. They really work! You just have to apply them. The instructor explains everything clearly and concretely so you never have to go back and think about what he meant and how to apply his advice. As a student of theoretical physics, I thought I was stupid but in reality, I was just highly inefficient. The course also helped me become more aware of what I'm doing with my time and, perhaps inadvertently, almost completely eliminated any distracting desires like mindless YouTube browsing and video games.\" - Rasmus Veikko Juhani Turkka, Udemy student\n\n\n\"This is an excellent course to help you develop techniques and habits to be more productive and procrastinate less. Unlike many of the other resources I found, this isn’t a one size fits all course, and it helps you identify methods and techniques that works best for you. I love the way TJ delivers his courses, he’s very engaging and always very informative.\" - Mohamed Joffe, Udemy student",

      "description": "Sketchnoting is a recent name given to a method of taking notes that involves text and simple images. Some people refer to these drawing as doodles!\nResearch has proven that when we write notes with our hands and draw images about things that we are listening or observing, the learning happens faster and retention of that information is much higher than taking notes on a computer or just writing textual notes.\n\nSketchnoting involves using our left brain, right brain and our hands to take notes. This means that we are more present in the moment, are paying more attention to things in front of us, synthesizing the information gathered and are then representing it on paper using text and and sketches.\nIn this class we look at simple ways of sketching  or drawing things using few simple shapes and easy ways of emphasizing text to make our sketchnotes much more interesting, readable and memorable.\nYou do not need any artistic skills to start sketchnoting as we are capturing ideas and not creating \"ART\".\nI also give you tips how to organize content on a sketchnote and how to make sketchnote more presentable using bullets, boxes, icons and arrows.\nAnybody who wants to  draw, sketch, doodle more effectively, learn to listen more effectively, learn new things at a faster pace and wants to present their ideas more effectively to others, will benefit from this course. It does not matter if that person is a student or a teacher, a doctor or an engineer, a consultant or a business owner, a freelancer or a home maker. Anybody who has ideas, can learn to make sketchnotes and reap it's benefits along the way.",

      "description": "Master course : boosting resilience with mindfulness\nIn the workplace, how can resilience help?\nIt's because resilient people recover from adversity without losing their confidence or morale. In the world of work, there will always be setbacks; never does anything go according to plan, and sometimes things go wrong out of our control. These things can get the best of us if we don't have the resilience to handle them.\nResilience: how do you build it?\nBecause resilience is so much about outlook and response, it's a special skill. In addition to techniques for improving one's initial response to something bad or unwanted, it's an adaptive mode of thinking. The short-term solution to negative thoughts is to use relaxation techniques - like deep breathing or even exercises - before tackling them more deeply through self-exploration and discussion. Having a support network in place where you can disclose anxieties and find solutions is crucial.\nLiving in the moment and mindfulness:\nBeing mindful means living in the moment. Living a more aware and awake life is what it's all about. Basically, it's about being fully present in every moment, being fully engaged in everything that happens. Instead of habitual patterns of judgment and criticism, it involves bringing an attitude of curiosity, acceptance, and friendliness.\nThe five major topics I'd like to cover in this master's course are:\n1. Introduction and the importance of resilience and mindfulness\n2. Benefits and pillars of resilience and mindfulness\n3. How do you build resilience through mindfulness?\n4. Resilience: Types, causes and how to develop it\n5. Mindfulness: Types, causes and how to develop it",

Four of the lectures include active learning activities integrated into the lectures, and the course also includes 13 additional exercises and topic understanding checks you can use to evaluate and hone your computational thinking skills.\nThe course includes lots of practice because computational thinking is a  set of skills that most people need to develop by applying those skills rather than just hearing someone talk about them!\nWhen you finish the course, you should be able to develop detailed step-by-step solutions to a variety of problems, think about and interpret data, and understand how different techniques improve problem solution efficiency.",

While AI tools are good and are improving, they still have a questionable track record when it comes to correct information outputs/responses. Also AI tools (currently) lack the ability to extrapolate meaning from historical context that has not been entered into the prompt.

It is hard to believe at first glance, but it is our fears, limitations, and limiting beliefs about ourselves and the world around us that prevent us from doing the activities we know we have to do to obtain the results we want to achieve.\nIn this course, we will focus precisely on recognizing what procrastination really is, in such a way that we can identify what are the personal factors that are leading us to procrastinate and leave aside what we consider important for our life.\nAfterwards we will focus on creating habits that allow us to complete our tasks more easily and be more productive in each of the areas of our life in which we have set ourselves a specific goal.\n\n\nThis course has been created by a procrastinator for procrastinators, in such a way that it does not become a course that repeats textbooks and self-help, which offer express techniques that in the long term are not useful.\nMoreover, this course is for those people committed to creating a powerful and radical change in their lives, eliminating those habits that do not allow them to advance in their lives and replacing them for those that are going to take them to the next level.\n\n\nIf you are willing to work on yourself and commit to a process that will transform your live and yourself, I welcome to the course!",

There are four DISC behavioral styles: Dominant, Influencing, Steady and Conscientious, each with their own set of emotional drivers, motivators, and predictable behavioral patterns.\nWhy DISC?\n1. It's very easy to understand. Unlike other behavioral assessments, the DISC uses only 4 archetypes which are easily remembered and free of jargon. These behavioral patterns are seen every day in our friends, family and coworkers, and you will be able to identify each of the types in this simple training.\n2. DISC doesn't require an assessment. DISC is 100% observable by using a person's words, actions and body language as an assessment tool.\n3. DISC is a proven and effective model that is applicable to 100% of the population with a high degree of validity. DISC assessments have been given to over 50 million people and 70% of Fortune 500 companies use DISC to develop solid and effective teams.\nThis course is a fun and exciting way to learn more about human behavior.

      "description": "Unlock Your Potential: Overcome Limiting Beliefs with Neuroscience\nDo you often find yourself stuck in patterns of self-doubt or negative thinking? Have you ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly achieve their goals while others struggle despite their best efforts? The key to success often lies in the beliefs we hold about ourselves—and many of us are unconsciously trapped by limiting beliefs. These beliefs, often formed in childhood or early life, shape our thinking and influence our behaviours, affecting everything from our careers to our personal relationships. But here’s the good news: Neuroscience shows us that we can change these beliefs and rewire our brains for success.\n\n\nIn this powerful and transformative course, we’ll explore the Neuroscience behind limiting beliefs, understand their impact on our minds, and learn how to use the latest insights from brain science to break free from the shackles of these beliefs. By leveraging your brain’s Neuroplasticity, you can reprogramme your mind, replace negative thought patterns, and adopt empowering beliefs that will help you unlock your full potential.\n\n\n\"Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.\" – Henry Ford\nThis famous quote by Henry Ford encapsulates the core truth that beliefs shape our reality. If you believe you are not good enough, your brain will seek out evidence to confirm that belief. If you believe you can achieve anything, your brain will actively look for opportunities to make that belief a reality. By understanding how limiting beliefs are formed and how they affect our brains, you’ll gain the tools to change them.\nThe Bible puts it like this \"As a man thinketh so is he\"\n\n\nWhat Are Limiting Beliefs?\nLimiting beliefs are deeply ingrained thoughts that we often accept as truth, but they do not reflect our full potential. These beliefs typically stem from past experiences, childhood programming, cultural influences, or societal conditioning. They often sound like,\n\"I’m not smart enough,\"\n\"I’ll never succeed,\"\n\"I don’t deserve happiness,\" or\n\"I’m not worthy of love.\"\nSuch beliefs often lead to feelings of inadequacy and helplessness, trapping us in a cycle of fear and self-sabotage.\n\n\nHowever, thanks to the study of Neuroscience, we now know that these beliefs are not set in stone. Your brain is malleable, capable of growth and change at any age. Through the concept of Neuroplasticity, we can rewire our brains to form new, positive neural connections that help us break free from limiting beliefs. This course will guide you in using scientifically backed techniques to change your mindset and achieve your goals.\n\n\nWhat’s Holding You Back?\nYou work hard. You set goals. You try to push forward.\nYet, deep down, something stops you from taking that next big step in your career, business, or personal life. A voice in your head whispers:\n“I’m not good enough.”\n“I’ll fail if I try.”\n“I don’t deserve success.”\n“Other people are smarter, luckier, or more capable than me.”\nThese thoughts aren’t facts. They are limiting beliefs—mental roadblocks that keep you stuck, erode your confidence, and hold you back from opportunities you’re more than capable of seizing.\nBut here’s the truth:\nYou weren’t born with these beliefs.\nThey were learned.\nAnd what is learned can be unlearned.\nThe latest research in neuroscience proves that your brain is not fixed—it can change, adapt, and form new neural pathways. That means the beliefs that are keeping you small can be rewired—and that’s exactly what this course will help you do.\n\n\nWhy Should You Invest in This Course?\nBecause your mind is your most valuable asset.\nImagine where you could be if self-doubt, fear, and hesitation no longer dictated your decisions. What would happen if you had the confidence to apply for that dream job, launch that business, or finally take action on that long-standing goal?\nMost people let limiting beliefs steal their potential for years—even decades. Don’t let that be you.\nThis course gives you the exact tools you need to break free from the mental patterns that are keeping you stuck and unlock the success you deserve.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Gain From This Course\nThis isn’t about fluffy motivation or temporary feel-good advice. This course is based on proven neuroscience-backed strategies that will help you rewire your brain for lasting change.\nHere’s what you’ll walk away with:\nA Deep Understanding of Limiting Beliefs – Learn how and why your brain forms them, how they affect your behaviour, and most importantly, how to break free from them.\nPractical Brain Rewiring Techniques – Use Neuroplasticity exercises to replace self-doubt with self-confidence and create new thought patterns that work for you, not against you.\nMindfulness & Self-Awareness Strategies – Spot limiting beliefs as they arise and stop them before they sabotage your progress.\nCognitive Reframing Tools – Shift your perspective and turn negative thoughts into empowering ones that drive success.\nThe Power of Affirmations & Visualisation – Learn how to train your subconscious mind to believe in your success before it even happens.\nA Growth Mindset for Lifelong Success – Move from a fixed mindset to one that embraces challenges, resilience, and continuous improvement.\nThis course isn’t about temporary confidence boosts—it’s about permanent transformation.\n\n\nHow Will This Course Change Your Life?\nRight now, your brain is wired to keep you in your comfort zone. That’s why every time you try to push yourself, you feel resistance. But imagine if:\nYou walked into interviews with unshakable confidence—knowing you deserve the opportunity.\nYou stopped doubting your abilities and took action on the things you’ve been procrastinating.\nYou stopped comparing yourself to others and started believing in your unique strengths.\nYou no longer hesitated to ask for a promotion, increase your prices, or pursue your dream career.\nThis is what happens when you rewire your brain and remove the mental blocks that are keeping you stuck.\nThe truth is, people don’t struggle because they aren’t talented or hardworking enough—they struggle because their own mind is getting in the way.\nDon’t let that be you.\n\n\nWho Is This Course For?\nProfessionals who feel stuck in their careers and want to break through to the next level.\nEntrepreneurs and business owners who struggle with self-doubt or imposter syndrome.\nStudents and high achievers looking to overcome mental blocks and boost their confidence.\nAnyone who has ever felt like their own mind is holding them back from success.\nIf you’ve ever felt like you’re on the verge of something great—but just can’t quite get there—this course will give you the push you need.\n\n\nThe Cost of Not Taking Action\nLet’s be honest: If you don’t change something, nothing changes.\nRight now, your limiting beliefs are costing you:\nMissed career opportunities because you didn’t feel “ready” to go for them.\nStagnation in your business because self-doubt stopped you from taking bold action.\nLack of confidence that makes you second-guess yourself at every turn.\nFrustration and regret because deep down, you know you’re capable of more.\nYou can keep waiting for confidence to magically appear—or you can take control and create it.\nYour future is shaped by what you believe. And right now, you have the opportunity to reprogram your beliefs, transform your mindset, and unlock your full potential.\n\n\nYour Mind is Your Most Powerful Tool\n“The mind is everything. What you think, you become.” – Buddha\nThe way you think shapes your reality. If you believe you’re not good enough, your brain will find evidence to confirm it. But if you train your mind to believe in your own abilities, your brain will start working for you, not against you.\nThis course gives you the scientific strategies to take back control, reprogram your subconscious mind, and finally start achieving the success you know you’re capable of.\nDon’t let another year pass by feeling stuck. Join the course today and start unlocking your true potential.\n\n\nAre you ready to break free from limiting beliefs and create the life you deserve? Enrol now!",

Learn time management fundamentals.\n\n\nEveryone faces the question of \"What do I want to achieve?\" at some point in their lives, and this is where goal setting comes into play. Setting goals is a planning process that helps you to clearly identify what you wish to achieve in your priority life areas, such as your career, relationships, finances, health, personal development, and the manner in which you contribute to the world.\n\n\nResearch shows that a large number of professionals fail to execute their action plan successfully. The problem often isn’t with planning but with executing the planning. It is very important to take a well-structured approach to implement and execute what is planned.\n\n\nGoal setting is a highly beneficial process for envisioning your ideal future, and also for motivating you to turn this vision into a tangible reality. You can determine your general direction in life through the process of setting goals. Having a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve will allow you to focus your efforts accordingly. Also, you will quickly identify factors that can easily lead you astray.\nGoals are concise expressions of what you hope to achieve within a specific time frame. As well as providing structure and definition to your life, they are distinctly more specific than vague dreams or aspirations. Whether you are a CEO, self-employed, unemployed, or working through a life transition, having clear and attainable life goals will empower you to continue to grow and develop as a person.\nBy establishing goals, you can gain long-term vision while also gaining short-term motivation. The process enables you to define and focus your learning, as well as to organize your time and your resources so that you can maximize your potential. In addition, you will gain greater self-confidence as you recognize your own ability and competence to accomplish the goals you have set.\n\n\nThe following are some of the topics you will learn during this course:\n\n\nVisualizing what you intend to achieve with your life.\nDiscerning what is important from what is irrelevant.\nSetting inspiring goals and positively framed outcomes\nThe values and priorities that guide decision-making.\nDifferent categories of goals and how to manage them.\nTransforming ideas into goals, and goals into a reality\n\n\nThe Art of Being Productive: Planning & Effective Execution is an online course, that will help professionals to overcome their most challenging execution obstacles on a working day and execute their tasks effectively to achieve better results.\nA business leader's job is to successfully move the organisation forward and improve business performance. This requires a continuous process of reflection, analysis, planning, and execution. There is no better way to learn/practice these skills than “by doing”. It doesn't matter how good your strategies and tactics are if you don't execute them well it won't really matter.\nWe designed an engaging course for you, You will learn all the aspects of how to create a plan for your objectives and various techniques to effectively execute your plan. Along with learning concepts of being productive, you will get multiple exercises for practicing the skill.\nIf you are a working professionals or student who want to learn the art of getting things done, this course is for you.",

I have created this course to aid people from every area of life that find it difficult trying to get everything done in one day.\nThis course is going to be split into three sections. Each is designed to build on the other, but each lecture is labelled by concept clearly, so you will also be able to come back and hit specific topics that are most helpful for you.\n\nThe first section aims at introducing you to time budgets. These show you where your time is being spent at the moment and then shows you where you can save time.\n\nIn our second section, we build the foundation for a new level of productivity - this starts with reviewing and rewarding ourselves. This means that we will cover the fundamental principles of creating long lasting time management habits that will transform your productivity.\n\nAnd finally in our last section we will build on the foundation we created by examining our plans for our time, why we never stick the plan and how we can create a plan that actually works for you.\n\nHere is what some of my students have to say about the course.\nGreat course!\nChris is great at explaining complicated ideas in simple ways. The techniques and tools in this course have sky-rocketed my productivity; I finally see where my time is going and have taken the appropriate steps to change my habits 'to make time for what matters to me'. All the way through the production quality was great, he has the best voice, and is always an engaging speaker. I would highly recommend this course if you want a productive way of life and want to get more done in less time (as the slogan says haha!) by Jason Wood\nLoads of great information in this course. I feel one step closer to success in my business goals because I finally have some great productivity and time management techniques. The instructor doesn't keep it all focused on him either he points to different apps that he thinks are important and that will help. 100% recommend. by William Ferris\n\nAmazing course\nThis course is great! There are fun exercises sprinkled throughout - they really help bring the course to life. Have recommended it to my friends. by Rishi Mistair\nGreat, let us not waste any more time. Jump in and get started!\n\nWho this course is for:\nThe course is for students who are overwhelmed and feel like they have too much to do in too little time.\nThis course is intended for the self-employed who want to be able to milk every minute of their work life so that they can live the life they have always dreamed of.\nThis course is designed for those that know they are capable of getting better results with their productivity but don’t know where to start.\nThis course is not intended for students are satisfied with their levels of productivity or are just looking for a fun course to take.",

      "description": "The right productivity method can make a huge difference in your work. The most successful people focus specifically on enhancing their personal productivity rather than just striving to get more done. Personal productivity involves strategically planning your tasks and schedule to maximize the time spent on your priorities - both professional and personal. If you want to get stuff done more efficiently to be better, faster, smarter, richer, or just to free up more time for things you enjoy. This course is for you. However, there’s one more crucial reason that you should learn to improve your personal productivity starting today.\nAccording to MIT economists and Leaders of research into the implications of digital technology Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew Mcafee, We are at the early stage of a Great economic restructure. Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind. For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire new machines or technology instead of new people. And when machines can’t help and only a human is required, improvements in communications and collaboration technology are making remote work easier than ever before. Motivating companies to outsource key roles to the best. leaving the local talent pool underemployed. In a global market, it no longer makes sense, for example to hire a full time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when one can instead pay one of the worlds’ best programmers, for just enough time and money.\nMcKinsey’s say “Automation and Artificial intelligence will lift productivity and economic growth, but millions of people worldwide may need to switch occupations or upgrade skills.”\nIn this great economic restructure, if you have to do more than surviving, you need to improve your personal productivity, your ability to focus, your ability to do more in less time, your ability to learn more in less time, your ability to produce more in less time without compromising the quality. Think about this, If everyone has the same number of hours in a day, How do some people do more, achieve more, earn more than others? Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus, how efficiently you manage your time and how prepared you are. In this crash course you will learn all essential aspects to quickly master new skill sets and produce at an elite level both in terms of quantity and quality. Unfortunately, our formal education system does not teach these skills. This is why we’re here. This crash course will not only enable you to increase your productivity exponentially you will be able to build momentum toward your goal, dial down the stress, revive your energy, find more clarity and positivity.\nI’m always here to help you.

      "description": "When you ask someone how they're doing, they typically say \"busy...crazy busy\".\nThis might sound like a badge of honor, but when people say they're busy what it means is that they're out of control.\nAnd when they say they're time poor, what it typically means is that they're decision poor.\nThe Time Rich productivity course has been designed to help you become decision rich when it comes to how you manage your time and attention so that you can get closer to your goals faster, sans 12-hour-days, and free up more time for your family, your friends, your health, and your personal interests.\n--\nIf you value your time at over $50 an hour, then this course will repay itself many times over in your very first week, just by applying some of what you learn.\n--\nDon't settle for cut-rate instruction from boring and unqualified teachers when it comes to managing your most precious asset...your time.\nThis course has been developed and is instructed by Steve Glaveski - an established productivity thought leader who brings his unique energy and personality to this course.\nSteve is the author of the 2020 Wiley book, Time Rich: Do Your Best Work, Live Your Best Life, and Harvard Business Review contributor on all things productivity, including the viral article, The Case for the 6-Hour Workday.\nHis work and wisdom have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fast Company, CNBC, European CEO, Australian Financial Review, Tech in Asia, The Irish Times, Entrepreneur, and countless other high-profile outlets, and he has inspired audiences to approach work differently on stages all over the world, including SXSW, Startup Grind Conference, Innov8rs, CPA Congress, as well as for corporate audiences at IBM, PayPal, Australia Post, Li & Fung, Ayala, and Charter Hall.\n--\nPraise for this course's companion book, Time Rich\n\"Steve Glaveski understands something that few leaders have figured out: it's possible to do less and get more done.

      "description": "Welcome to this course on getting started with reflective practice. The importance of reflective practice is something that has been emphasized for quite some time now, although the strength of this emphasis is not generally matched by the degree of clarity about what reflective practice is, why it is important or how to actually do it. This course has therefore been developed specifically for people who are new to reflective practice or are familiar with reflective practice but want a better understanding of what it is all about.\nThe course contains a short video introduction, four video-based lessons and a video conclusion, accompanied by a workbook. The three lessons cover:\n1. Myths about reflective practice Unfortunately, reflective practice is characterized by a number of myths and misunderstandings. In this lesson I clear up some of the obstacles to understanding.\n2. What is reflective practice? Having clarified what reflective practice is not, this lesson provides a clear picture of what it is all about.\n3. Reflective writing This lesson explores the value and limitations of the practice of reflective writing.\n\n\n4. Making it happen In this third and final lesson we look at some strategies for actually doing reflective practice.\nThe Module Companion is a workbook that you will need to print out before you start the course. It contains space for notes plus an exercise relating to each of the three lessons. This is an important resource for you, as it will help to extend and consolidate your understanding and provide you with a set of notes to act as a reference source for future development.\nReflective practice, when done properly, can make a huge positive difference to the quality and quantity of your work, your job satisfaction and your continued learning and development.",

We are overscheduled and constantly distracted, leaving no room for us to find more intelligent ways to deal with the challenges presented to us. Quality time for basic leadership behaviours such as reflection and acknowledgement succumb to the impulse of jumping to the next thing. Fortune 500 company executives, leading government authorities and academics have now recognised that mindfulness, the art of being fully present, is the key to overcoming the complexity and relentless pace of our world which can take a toll on our mind and physical health.\nMindful leaders are extremely focused, have clarity of mind and are naturally inclined to be of service to others. They have the ability to achieve their goals with effortless ease without feeling overburdened. Mindful leaders are able to improve the way they work and lead by breaking away from habitual patterns of behaviour that are no longer useful. They feel connected to their values and those of their organisation. Others around a mindful leader see and feel that presence.\nIn this course you will learn in practical ways how to develop a mindful state, so that you can become a better version of the leader you are today.",

What would happen if you could use 25% of your mind? Or 50%? Would you like to effortlessly increase your comprehension level five times or even ten times?\nRichard taught high school math for 5 years before becoming Head Instructor for Speed Reading Toronto, Canada. He next became a certified Master Hypnotist/Relaxation. Combining the two professions, it dramatically shortened his student's learning curve for Speed Reading.\nIn this experiential course (Yes, you have to do the exercises and practise), Richard unlocks the secret of your mind in a gentle, effective manner that will have you whipping through memos, emails, technical manuals and, yes, even reading and enjoying your favorite books in record time!\nUntrained readers use the central focus of their eyes, but not \"Horizontal Peripheral Vision\" as they read losing about 50% of their reading speed. In this course, we will show you a easy method to essentially doubling your reading speed, by removing this loss.\n\nThe untrained reader tends to consciously re-read lines and back-skip (subconscious rereading due to their eyes jumping around) for up to 30% of their reading.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n1) The importance of Hand Motion. This fundamental of Speed Reading in discouraged in schools, oddly enough. Yet you will double your speed simply because this active reading secret prevents your eyes from doing the one thing eyes like to do that slows your reading to a snail's pace. (Lecture 7)\n2) How to Super-Charge your Memory. What is the point of reading faster if you forget faster. (Lecture 12)\n3) Relaxation and Visualization. Stress interferes with your mind's natural brilliance. Our society is so stressful, you don't even know you are stressed out and that your mind is performing at extremely low efficiency. Do you run faster carrying a 50 pound backpack or without it? You read carrying a 50 pound 'backpack'. Time to let it go. (Lecture 16)\nThis course is perfect for you if you always thought there was a better way to acquire knowledge and keep it.\nBut, if you want my personal \"insider\" information - remember I've helped over 125,000 readers, just like you, dramatically increase their reading speed and retention - you need to get this course now ... right this minute.\nEvery minute you delay is actually COSTING you time and money....\nRegister for Speed Readnig Simplified Today!",

      "description": "Getting lost in ideas\nMost people do not think with a step-by-step method - and they rely much on their natural brain skills.\nA lot of us end up feeling overwhelmed and stuck, or simply afraid of tackling certain challenges.\nWe start and stop projects, we collect ideas in notebooks and never execute, we feel at a loss when presenting an idea, and even offering the right gift to our friends takes weeks of back-and-forth and mental rut.\n\nStep-by-step techniques to think like a professional\nBut thinking, generating ideas and making decisions is a muscle to train and this course introduces 2 of the most advanced techniques to practice confidently.\nThese techniques originate from advertising, an industry that sells for more than 1.2 trillion dollars a year of ideas. A sector where waiting to be struck by lightning and \"get an idea\" would be completely irrational.\nSo we adopted professionals' best methods to create simple but highly efficient techniques to gain enough confidence to present an idea to our clients.\nThis course helps anyone acquire two fundamental techniques in less than 2 hours:\ngenerating ideas faster, by putting ourself under time pressure\ngetting confidence in the best idea to solve a problem by using a simple and rational model\nThanks to these two techniques, anyone can then go on tackling problems that seemed insurmountable, from starting a business, keeping a habit, or changing career.\n\n\nWho should take this course?\nThis course has been taught to thousands of participants in real life before being adapted to digital.\nEntrepreneurs have seen a direct increase in their earnings in the weeks following the use of better decision tools, and we have helped hundreds of them.\nStudents of Master's degrees have picked up better career choices in less than 60 minutes because they could compare their options rationally.\nDigital Nomads have improved their work-life balance by generating more options.\nDiplomatic staff in 20+ countries have generated better campaigns to reinforce their presence in the country.\nSocial entrepreneurs and refugees in Uganda have planned business ideas after being exposed to the training.\nIllustrators and professional creatives have seen their techniques of work sped up to deliver better work to their clients and find new ones\nThe course is extremely practical and thanks to the included exercises it will be easy for you to do the work while following along.\nYou both learn and practice, so by the end of the course you already have solved an important challenge of yours AND adopted a new skill.\n\n\nThe trainer:\nCharlelie Jourdan, 39 yo. French - living in Spain\n\nFor the last 8 years, Charlelie has facilitated more than 200 brainstorming sessions, sometimes for up to 150 people at the same time. He has trained 2000+ people on techniques of fast ideation and decision-making, developing blueprints for thinking faster.\nHe was the founder and creative director of a 10-people advertising agency for 6 years and has launched 2 other businesses. He started his career in international politics and worked for the European Parliament.\nCharlelie is currently a consultant and trainer working for organizations such as the European Union, Google EU, Intel, BNP-Paribas, EU diplomatic delegations, and various tech startups.

      "description": "In today's highly pressurized workplaces there is much to be gained by developing our knowledge, skills and confidence in relation to time and workload management. This course, equivalent to a full-day's continuous professional development, provides opportunities to learn how to manage our pressures as effectively as possible.\nThe course, presented and developed by author, Dr Neil Thompson, is based on four principles of Time and Workload Management:\n·Too much work is too much work Trying to do more than we reasonably can is unhelpful. If we are overloaded we need to think strategically about how we can deal with the situation, rather than simply work faster or harder.\n·Managing energy as well as time How much work we can get done in a given amount of time will depend on levels of motivation and morale, so these are important factors to consider.\n·Skills not qualities No one is born well organised or focused; these are skills we can learn, skills that can be developed over time.\n·Investing time to save time Not taking time to think, plan, analyse and get a sense of control is a serious but sadly not uncommon mistake.\nDivided into six main lessons, the course provides a clear and helpful introduction to this important subject matter and offers an excellent foundation for developing your knowledge, skills and confidence in tackling the challenges of managing a heavy workload.\nThis course will help you to feel more confident in making sure that your workload pressures remain within manageable limits so that you can keep stress at bay.\nThe course has been designed to be flexible so that you can dip into it when it suits you within your busy schedule. In keeping with one of the important lessons put forward by this course, the time invested in it will be handsomely repaid by greater confidence in managing your pressures efficiently and effectively.",

However the course walks you through how mind maps and the mind mapping process can be used to easily and quickly prepare, rehearse and deliver talks and speeches. For those that don't know mind mapping yet, this course is a great introduction to show you one of its greatest benefits.\nIn the course you'll be following a case study where you are taken, step by step, through an easy-to-use and effective process to plan, rehearse and deliver a lecture.  Plus there are two short projects that give you an opportunity to put your own learning into practice.\nFor Mind Mappers: Do you just use mind mapping for occasional brainstorming exercises rather than to USE it everyday with practical business applications like planning and rehearsing presentations?\nFor Non-Mind Mappers: Have you avoided learning this technique because you can't readily see any useful practical applications? Well here is one very practical application\nSpeaking Skills: Can you present confidently to an audience without notes? Are you already a confident Public Speaker or do you require help?\nSpeaking Skills: Do you need to present effectively in front of a camera with a conversational style? Would you like to quickly construct audio recordings like podcasts for example? This course will help you become a better public speaker both to a live audience and in front of camera.\nSpeaking Skills: Do you need to reduce the time it takes to prepare and learn a new speech or present a new workshop?\nSpeaking Skills: The course shows you how to massively reduce your preparation time, overcome writers block, and if necessary memorise your talk, all using one simple technique on a single sheet of paper.",

Speed reading is the process of quickly recognizing and absorbing phrases or sentences on a page all at once, rather than identifying individual words like we all do in the old ways. The concept of speed reading is done on a key specific purpose, now there are so many information available daily that we need to read and get the detail information to inform our decisions. When we currently  look at the social media, books and even magazines there is much to do within a few minute, now the average reader can read almost 250 words per minute (WPM) all this is done in other to learn and get the information quickly without wasting no time. For some years back we all read and later pronounce what we have read through our mouth or in our head but this strategy impede progress and lower our desire to read faster.\nThe individual ability to read faster and still understand it is a very great skill that need learning and practicing it. We must understand this clearly that you cannot read speedily and still get the detail information like you are reading slowly let all establish that fact first, assuming you are reading legal document its clear that you need to take your time to assimilate the information. To speed read faster and still get the understanding is a very big skill. One need to create the required environment that is conducive to learning, avoid distraction and interruption so that you can be focus and get the necessary skills and information, its always important that to read well you must know what you want from the text.

The formation of these big planets will create a certain energy pattern. The year, month, day and hour of our date of birth can be translated into these energies. In Chinese Metaphysics, these energies are wood, fire, earth, metal and water, and each of these energies have its quality of Yang and Yin.\nIn the Arts of Destiny Analysis, these energies pattern are called as the Natal Chart or Static Energy Patterns. These energies will in turn change based on the formation of the celestial bodies movement from time to time, and these changes are called Luck Period or the Dynamic Energy Patterns.\nOne of the branch studies that we are going to learn here is the Four Pillars of Destiny. This art has already existed since hundred to thousand years ago. This art is still exist until now because if it isn't giving benefit to mankind, naturally this art of course will slowly cease to exist. The accuracy of this art is almost between 70-90%.\nIf we apply this art correctly, from the Natal Chart and the Luck Period, we can analyze our character, wealth, power, love, relationship with parent and children, disease and bad luck. By using this art of Four Pillars of Destiny, we can reveal a person destiny and help to play it out to their best possible benefit.",

Now more than ever, today’s employers are after more than technical ability or hard skills; they are looking for real team players who have strong interpersonal communication skills and who demonstrate resourcefulness and leadership in the workplace.\nA college degree and or past-experience no longer guarantees you a successful career. Transitional skills, also known as soft skills, are also now required — indeed, are often more highly desired — across all industries. In fact, organizations and companies are now actively recruiting candidates without traditional academic qualifications, preferring to hire for attitude and train for aptitude. Becoming the best and most attractive employee you can be starts with becoming the best and most attractive person you can be.\nWorking and playing nice with others and being a nice person — using soft skills — doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but you can acquire these skills. The problem is knowing where to do that. Many universities, colleges, and schools don’t teach them, and employers often don’t have time to train their employees in them.\n\n\nThis course is specifically designed to help you prepare to enter or reenter the workforce by providing a comprehensive guide to the essential employability traits and soft skills needed for success in the 21st century workplace.\nThis course’s goal is to help you cultivate the essential personal attributes attractive to future employers: attitude, character, communication, cultural awareness, appearance and etiquette, time management, teamwork, work ethic, critical thinking, and leadership.",

      "description": "The course explores the structure of thinking and usefulness and purpose of Graphic Organisers and in particular why Mind Mapping is a particularly useful graphical organiser technique for thought organisation and for getting clarity with thinking.\nThe course starts by looking at the downsides of creating large lists and how graphical organisers like the tree diagram can make lists more intelligible through organising information into linked hierarchies. A very primitive way to organise a list is with outlining (a feature available on most word processors) and I show how outlining is a half way step toward creating a tree diagram.\nWe then look at how the tree diagram can itself be reformatted into a radiant organiser and what benefits accrue from doing this. Then through the application of Buzan's principles for Mind Mapping, the course demonstrates how any radiant organiser can be transformed into a (proper) Mind Map.\nThe course is likely to be of interest to anyone interested to learn more about the structure of their thinking especially in the context of using Mind Mapping for this particular purpose\nFor those not familiar with Buzan's principles of Mind Mapping these principles are summarised in the last section of the course",

I'm a personal productivity coach.\nAnd I know,\nYou want to spend more time with friends and family but you're not able to\nYou want to travel the world but you're not able to\nYou want to learn something you love but you're not able to\nYou want to do things you love, you want to be with someone you love but why you're not able to? because all these things need your time and you don't have time because you don't know your priorities.\nYou're not able to do all these things because you don't know what is your priority on No. 1, 2,3, and so on.\nYou're working all day long, maybe more than 8-10 hours a day, like a machine without realizing what matters most to me and for my success, what is important than others and what is not.\nI believe life is short, you shouldn't waste your time on things that are not going to matter after a month or year later. That’s why I created this class to teach you how to find & finish top priorities and manage urgent & important tasks activities so you can live your dream life.\nI use the Eisenhower Matrix. By doing so, I identify my critical tasks and get rid of those who don’t bring me closer to my goals anyway. The Eisenhower Method helps you to identify which tasks you should focus on, which to delegate and which to get rid of entirely. By categorizing your tasks according to importance and urgency, you can more easily decide on what to do next.\nAlongside mastering the Eisenhower matrix this class helps you become more efficient, save time, get more things done, and up level your lives every day.\nSo let’s get started now",

Finally, you will see how I use notes to organize my life and how I treat it as a second brain.\nNo fluff\nI've been teaching on Udmey for the better part of a decade and in that time I've learned that learner time is beyond valuable. This course is designed to be direct and easy to follow. The majority of lessons are 3-4 minutes long so that you can get the information you need at a moment's notice.\nAlways updated\nWe know that software never stands still.

This course has every Rubik's cube you can think of, and goes into speed solving as well as the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, shape shifting cubes, Megaminx cube and even the Triangular pyramid. You'll learn many things throughout the master class but the main part of the course is focused around the 3x3 cube, because that's the cube everyone wants to learn. We’ll get into other things in this course such as the checkered pattern, and pixel art with 3X3 cubes. I wanted this course to have the most amount of information so the students could learn countless cubes by setting it at a cheap and affordable price, so that anyone can enjoy solving cubes just as much as I have. I also made it so that if you just want to solve one of the cubes in the course you can buy it and always come back if you ever felt like solving a different cube. There are so many things we are going to go over throughout the course but I thought I would mention this can all be learnt in one day. So if you’re like me and you’re willing to learn, this is the course for you.",

        "This is the easiest beginner course on how to solve any and all types of Rubik's cubes, you need absolutely no experience or skills to begin learning how to solve the cubes. I don't like to use algorithms or complicated methods, instead I use my very own method to teach you step by step in the easiest way possible. I've made the course so that you can learn every Rubik's cube for the most value wether you're interested in just learning the 3x3 or the 4x4, you'll always have access incase you decide to learn another cube. So if you have a Rubik's cube and are willing to learn, this is the course for you."

(Mom of one of my students)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"By the way, thank you for the added bonus of guiding Alia in her future. She said you were an excellent SAT teacher, but more importantly a remarkable life coach! ;-))\" - Jinous R (Mom of one of my students)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Love the SAT has been a lifesaver for my SAT score! I came into it thinking it was just another SAT class, but after just one class I felt an improvement. My attitude has changed into a more positive one because of the teacher, Christian. His enthusiasm and tips and tricks made a huge difference! After a lot of practice with the skills I've learned at Love the SAT, my score improved by 400 points. I'm very satisfied with my score, and I highly recommend Love the SAT!\" - Kasmira M., high school student\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's not hard to help a smart teenager TRANSFORM their life in high school, but it DOES require an exceptionally talented, empathetic and experienced teacher who students can relate to.\nSometimes it's hard for parents and students to make the connection, since it's such an INTENSE relationship during high school and you're both under so much pressure.\nThat's where I come in! As a tutor, entrepreneur, and a bit of a difficult case myself in high school, I have a rare talent for helping teens go from a constant state of rushing panic (or a state of aimless laziness!) to a calm, measured and successful approach to life that's more FUN and more SUCCESSFUL than the old ways...\nAnd best of all this transformation will help you have a BIGGER and MORE AUTHENTIC IMPACT on the world.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy favorite \"testimonial\" ever, from one of my students in China:\nI met a teacher, his name was Christian. He always smiled, everytime had a happy look in his face. He was also really energetic, he went from one side to the other side of the classroom. Every single class Christian told us that we need to have motivation in order to be good at anything in this world. After hearing these words for a week. I finally got some motivation. I closed everything, every electronic device that would bother me. I spent just 20 minutes everyday after school memorizing vocabs. After few months I figured out that I had learned more then 500 words perfectly. I realized that it wasn't me who was bad at memorizing things. It was myself who didn't have motivation to do things. I was going the easy, lazy way. Although it was a short time being with Christian, I had learn alot of things from him. He was the engine that started me to get going. If I meet him again I really want to thank him. I wish i could eventually meet him again.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the ULTIMATE course on Time Management for teens and it contains EVERY essential lesson, quiz, and reading we could pack in.\nComplete the entire course from start to finish (6+ hours of material) or pick and choose from the well-organized lecture titles.\nSince the students who need this course are already busy, it's designed in easily-digestible bite-sized sections.\nYou can study this course for a weekend or you can study it for years.

Just learning won’t cut it…you need to take proper ACTION!\n\n\nLie # 2: Do what the “experts” do and you will get the same results.\n\n\nAccording to recent research by University College London, even a well regarded habit like meditation can cause negative effects like fear, panic & distorted emotions for as much as 25.6% of practitioners.\nWE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND YOU SIMPLY CANNOT LIVE UP TO YOUR POTENTIAL BY BUILDING HABITS THAT WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE. Finding & building YOUR keystone habits is essential to building your ultimate self!\n\n\nLie # 3: Motivation & positive thinking is enough to help you achieve your goals.\n\n\nA study by the University of Kentucky & Alpert Medical School of Brown University, found that motivation alone is not enough in order to be consistent in your actions.

      "description": "Dear Friend,\n\n\nIf you want to develop your potential as much as you can in life, this will be the most important course you'll ever watch.\n\n\nBut First, Read This Disclaimer:\n\n\nPlease understand my results are not typical. I’m not implying you’ll duplicate them (or do anything for that matter).\n\n\nThis course is only for those that feel they have great potential but they waste it because they are not disciplined to develop and nourish that potential.\n\n\nThe average person who buys any \"how to\" courses gets little to no results. I'm using these references for example purposes only.\n\n\nYour results will vary and depend on many factors ...including but not limited to your background, experience, and level of determination.\n\n\nIf you don't really care about striving to be the best version of yourself, please DO NOT GET THIS COURSE. It's not really for the average person.\n\n\nSo with that understood ... let me jump right in and show you what's this really all about...\n\n\nExactly What You're Getting\n\n\nFirst of all, this isn't like any personal development course you've ever watch.\n\n\nThere's no fluff or filler - just battle-tested principles to be the most self-disciplined person you've ever seen.\nAnd it's easy to watch, we created animated videos to better express a concept or idea.\nAnd It's About MORE Than Just Self-Discipline.\nSee, you can use the same methods in this course to change your bad habits, increase productivity, strengthen your ability to focus and much more.\n\n\nFor example, some students used this to achieve their fitness goals, others for their financial goals.\n\n\nA client of mine went from being lazy and without purpose to open a new business and become a trusted influencer. Now he's enjoying the benefits of being a focused, productive and disciplined person.\n\n\nAnother client said that he could never be consistent in his work. He's motivation fluctuated even if he saw positive results. After watching this course, he's motivation started to increase without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n\nTHIS IS NOT JUST A COURSE. IT'S A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n\nIt is a complete personal development program from A to Z. Hundreds of our clients say it is the most complete program on self-discipline on the market today.\n\n\nHundreds of people completely changed their life using The Unstoppable Discipline Program. This course gave them the \"WHY\" of their life. They BANISHED addictions, bad habits, negative thinking, indecision and fearful thoughts.\n\n\nIf you want to experience the MOST POWERFUL transformation of your life, you cannot afford NOT TO GET THIS COURSE.\n\n\n\"So like I said, there's more to The Unstoppable Discipline Program than \"just\" self-discipline. Here's a fraction of what you're getting...\n\n\nHow to actually stick to your daily commitments.

      "description": "Not Enough Willpower? Create A System! Procrastination can hold us back from achieving our goals. It can lead to feelings of guilt, stress, and anxiety. But imagine the great outcome if you could overcome procrastination. You could learn and achieve more, feel less stressed and anxious, and be more fulfilled.\nThe good news is that procrastination is not a permanent problem. There are many things you can do to overcome it. So what are you waiting for?\n\n\nI am here to tell you that I, too, was in this situation.\n\n\nI used to be a chronic procrastinator. I would put off tasks until the last minute, and I would often fail to complete them altogether. This led to a lot of stress and anxiety, and it made it difficult for me to achieve my goals.\nOne day, I decided that I had had enough. I was tired of feeling stressed and anxious, and I was tired of failing. I decided to learn how to overcome procrastination and become more productive.\nI started by reading books and articles on procrastination. I learned about the different types of procrastination, and I learned about the reasons why people procrastinate. I also learned about some of the techniques that people use to overcome procrastination.\nOne of the most important things I learned is that procrastination is not a character flaw. It's a habit that can be broken. I also learned that there are a number of things I can do to overcome procrastination. I can break down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. I can set deadlines for myself. I can eliminate distractions. And I can reward myself for completing tasks.\nIt hasn't been easy, but I've been making progress. I'm still a work in progress, but I'm no longer the chronic procrastinator I used to be. I'm more productive, and I'm less stressed and anxious.\n**If you're a procrastinator, I encourage you to ** not give up. Procrastination can be beaten. It just takes time and effort. There are a number of resources available to help you, and there are a number of techniques that you can use. So don't give up. You can do it!\n\n\n\n\nA SOLUTION THAT WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE\nThe solution to procrastination is simpler than you think. It's all about tiny habits. These are small, easy things that you do consistently every day. They don't require willpower, and they can have a big impact on your life.\nOver time, tiny habits can shape who you are. They can help you build success, and they can make you happier. On the other hand, procrastination can lead to stress, anxiety, and disappointment.\nIn the system I've created, the habits are so simple that anyone can do them. I've broken them down into easy-to-follow steps, so you can start seeing results right away.\n\n\nIf you're ready to defeat procrastination once and for all, I encourage you to give this system a try. It's the simplest, most effective way to break the procrastination habit and start living your best life.\n\n\nAMAZING TESTIMONIALS FROM OUR SATISFIED LEARNERS!\n\n\nTheir words speak for themselves!\n★★★★★ \"This is a fantastic course that helps me to improve my time to get things done and adopt techniques to achieve my goals!\"\nIgnacio Paz, Agile Coach\n★★★★★  \"I was positively surprised.

      "description": "\"Success is directly tied to your ability to focus. The more you control your focus, the more control you have over your life.\" – Cal Newport, Deep Work\nIn today’s world, distractions are everywhere. Studies show that the average person’s attention span has shrunk by 25% in just the last decade. From social media notifications to constant multitasking, staying focused has never been harder. Research indicates that the average office worker is interrupted every 11 minutes, and it can take up to 25 minutes to regain full focus after a distraction. But what if you could change that? What if you could regain control of your focus, eliminate distractions, and achieve extraordinary levels of productivity?\nIntroducing Master Your Focus: Boost Productivity with Hyperfocus—a scientifically-backed course that will empower you to take control of your attention and supercharge your productivity. This course isn’t just about theory—it’s about giving you the tools, strategies, and techniques used by high-performing professionals to achieve laser-sharp focus and reach their goals faster and more efficiently.\nWe start by understanding the neuroscience of focus. Your brain’s prefrontal cortex is responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and concentration. We’ll dive into how this part of the brain works and why it’s critical for focus. Plus, you’ll discover how neurotransmitters like dopamine play a pivotal role in sustaining attention and motivation. In fact, dopamine levels have been linked to productivity: when dopamine is activated, focus increases by up to 40%. We’ll also cover how conditions like ADHD and anxiety affect focus and teach you practical, scientifically-backed strategies to counteract these challenges.\nBut understanding the science is just the beginning. To truly unlock your full focus potential, we’ll teach you powerful, research-proven focus techniques. You’ll learn how mindfulness and meditation can increase cognitive function by up to 40%, enhance attention span, and help you perform under pressure. In addition, we’ll provide you with brain training exercises to increase mental agility and retention, techniques that have been shown to improve focus in as little as 4 weeks.\nIn this course, we also tackle your environment—because where you work has a massive impact on your focus. Studies have found that the average worker spends 47% of their day in a state of distraction. We’ll teach you how to create a distraction-free environment, both physically and digitally, to optimize your focus. You’ll learn the power of nutrition in brain function, including the foods that boost cognitive performance and enhance concentration. Plus, we’ll discuss how hydration and sleep impact your ability to focus, with research showing that sleep deprivation can decrease cognitive performance by up to 40%.\nOnce you’ve mastered the fundamentals, it’s time to put them into action. This course will teach you how to integrate focus into your daily routine. You’ll learn how to set SMART goals—goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound—to stay on track and build momentum. You’ll also experience the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that has been shown to increase productivity by 25%. Whether you’re a student, entrepreneur, or professional, you’ll discover tailored strategies to maintain focus throughout the day, despite the distractions that surround you.\nSustaining focus for the long term requires more than just short-term fixes. That’s why we’ve included a 21-day challenge to help you form lasting habits that support your focus goals. The science of habit formation tells us that it takes 21 days to establish a new routine—and by the end of this challenge, you’ll have developed focus strategies that last a lifetime. We’ll also help you combat procrastination, a major focus killer, by teaching you practical tools to stay on track even when motivation is low.\nFinally, you’ll learn how to adapt and evolve your focus strategies as your personal and professional life changes. The key to lifelong productivity is continuous learning. We’ll introduce you to emerging trends and tools to enhance your focus even further.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a complete toolkit of scientifically proven techniques to master your focus, boost your productivity, and achieve your goals with greater efficiency and clarity. Whether you’re aiming to study better, perform at a higher level in your career, or simply gain better control over your attention, this course will give you the edge you need to succeed.\nUnlock your full potential.

In this course you'll learn how to set goals the right way – based on the scientific research on goal setting of the last four decades.\nAt the beginning, we'll briefly cover the Why? of goal-setting before we learn which factors distinguish a good goal from a bad goal.

Right goal-setting is much more than using the widely known SMART framework – there is research on goal-setting from all over the world, including psychology labs from the best universities of the world.\n\nWe look at research that shows what makes successful goals stand out and which factors are often overlooked when people set goals. You also learn why it's often best to avoid do-your-best goals and how you can use thinking errors for your benefit. We look at how to prime your unconsciousness, at intention implementations and much, much more.\n\nThe second major part of this course is the section on Mapping for Goal-Success. There you learn how to best set goals by actually doing it. We present a wide range of exercises that are the ideal preparation for achieving your goals, there are more than ten worksheets, a couple of quizzes and a variety of other ways of learning and putting the insights into practice.\n\nAmong other things, you'll be able to tap into your True Self, measure and increase commitment to your goal, define the various kinds of resources and obstacles in your way and again much, much more.\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have learned what factors are important for successful goal-pursuit. You will have a thorough understanding of how to approach any goal you will set yourself in the future. And you will have the tools and resources you need to set yourself up for success.\nOne more thing: You have a totally unconditional money back guarantee.

CLOSER to attaining your personal and professional goals?\n\n\nMost people would answer 'YES' to these questions.\n\n\nIt's just organizing and managing tasks, isn't easy for most people.\n\n\nOnly a few are naturals at it!\n\n\nIt's \"not something\" you're born with.\n\n\nBut it's a SKILL, that's completely learnable …\n\n\nFor example,\n\n\nHave you ever woke up in the morning and thought to yourself…\n\n\n\"Okay, so what do I have to do today?\"\n\n\nMost people start their day thinking about what they have to do – and then try to decide what they should do first.\n\n\nIt could be something work-related … errands you have to run, or of course the list of items you never got around to yesterday.\n\n\nHow much time \"each day,\" do you think is wasted, with all this decision-making?\n\n\nIt's a LOT!\n\n\nWith all this \"extra time\" spent thinking about what should be done next – you could easily have crossed off several items from your to-do list.\n\n\nOkay, what's the best course of action?\n\n\nHow can you start recapturing all this lost time?\n\n\nIt Starts by Setting Your Priorities\n\n\nWhen setting your priorities, start with your overall goals and passions first, and your priorities will follow.\n\n\nThis is more than just writing your to-do list.\n\n\nSetting \"effective priorities\" involves creating your ideal system for figuring out what really is important to do … and what isn't.\n\n\nWhen you line up what's important with what needs doing – you have your priorities straight.\n\n\nThe 5 Key Factors of Priority Setting\n\n\nIt's the BIG goals you set for yourself that determine your priorities.\n\n\nSo, focus on these five key factors, and let your goals drive your priorities and \"everything else\" you do.\n\n\nKey 1: Your Motivation\n\n\nAre your goals really something that you're passionate about?\n\n\nKey 2: Your Resources\n\n\nDo you have everything at your disposal to achieve your goals?\nIf not, how can you acquire what you need?\n\n\nKey 3: Your Time\n\n\nDo you have the time required to complete your goals?\nAre you realistically aware about the level of time commitment that they need?\n\n\nKey 4: Your Ability\n\n\nDo you have the skills to complete your goals?\nWhat do you need to work on?\n\n\nKey 5: The Consequences\n\n\nWhat are the real repercussions of your goals?\nHow will it affect you and everyone around you?\nDo you need to be prepared for that change?\n\n\nYour Priorities Propel You to Success\n\n\nSounds simple, right?\n\n\nAnd it is simple … but it's not that easy, or so many people wouldn't be lying awake at night, just thinking about that BIG to-do list!\n\n\nThis is \"the main reason why\" we decided to do something about it …\n\n\nWhat we did is put together an online course that walks you through different methods for setting your priorities – so you can discover the ones that \"work best\" for you.\n\n\nIt's called: \"Mastering Your Priorities\"\n\n\nIn Mastering Your Priorities, we guide you through \"several different proven systems\" for setting priorities – along with the keys for making them work.\n\n\nYou get to try them all … find the one you like most, and set a few priorities while you're at it.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to:\n\n\nSuccessfully set priorities, for all areas of your life.\nImplement the \"basic principles\" of setting priorities that work.\nUse a simple method of categorizing daily tasks.\nEmploy a ranking technique that allows you to put first things first.\nEstablish your own rating scale system for setting priorities.\nPersonalize your priority-setting method, to make it perfect for you.\nBox up your time to keep it under control.\nGet rid of distractions and boost your productivity.\nAvoid common mistakes that can keep your system from working.\nSet compelling priorities that get done AND reduce your daily stress level too!\n\n\nThe Mastering Your Priorities course is divided up into 10-easy, bite-size sections so that you won't get overwhelmed.\n\n\nNever again procrastinate over the tasks on your to-do list!\n\n\nYou'll also get \"Learning Activities and Tools\" to help you remember what you learned and to put it all into action.\n\n\nFor each section, you'll get an \"Action-sheet\" to take notes and start implementing each priority-setting technique.\n\n\nYou're setting priorities already – and often unconsciously.\n\n\nThis course teaches you how to \"take conscious control\" over your daily list of things to do.\n\n\nWhat You Are About to Discover\n\n\nHere are the topics covered in each section of the course:\n\n\nModule 1 – Why You Need to Set Priorities\nModule 2 – Daily Priorities Start with Long Term Goals\nModule 3 – The Basics of Setting

We'll start by examining why critical thinking matters and define our terms and key concepts. Next, we'll identify and discuss how to overcome several common cognitive biases, foster intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness, and cultivate a growth mindset. We'll also examine in detail the six components of critical thinking, which are: observing, understanding, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating. Next, we'll use the Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose (CRAAP) test to help us assess the reliability of sources and credibility of information. Then, we'll discuss how to use deductive and inductive reasoning to form arguments and evaluate the strength of an argument. Each module of instruction is followed with a knowledge check to help you retain and apply key learning points. Before you take the final assessment, you'll also have several opportunities to develop your critical thinking skills in each of the six components as you apply your skills to a problem-centric scenario. These exercises are intended to help you transfer what you learn to the real-world and give yourself the decision advantage.",
