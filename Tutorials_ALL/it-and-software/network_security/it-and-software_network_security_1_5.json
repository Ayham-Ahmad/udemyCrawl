It is widely used by ethical hackers and penetration testers to assess the security of systems.\n\n\nHow does Metasploit work?\nMetasploit uses various exploits to detect vulnerabilities in target systems. Users select an exploit and send it with a payload (malicious software) to gain access to the system.\n\n\nWhat can be done with Metasploit?\nWith Metasploit, you can penetrate systems, detect vulnerabilities, perform post-exploitation actions, exfiltrate data, and report vulnerabilities. It can also be used for creating payloads and conducting social engineering attacks.\n\n\nIs it legal to use Metasploit?\nMetasploit should only be used for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes. Using it on systems without proper authorization is illegal and can lead to legal consequences. Ethical hackers and security experts must obtain explicit permission from system owners before using this tool.\n\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points\n\n\nWhy should you enroll in this course?\nOne reason: Muharrem Aydın.

      "description": "PBR is the process of using a route map to specify an attribute other than the destination and then define the path out of the router based on those conditions.\n\n\nWith PBR, a network administrator can select policies according to specific parameters, such as:\n\n\n• The IP address of the source or the destination\n• The port of the source or destination\n• The kind of traffic\n• Network protocols\n• The sizes of data packets\n• An access list\n\n\nOnce parameters like these are established, the data packets get routed accordingly. This empowers you to increase the agility of the network.\n\n\nBecause you can define your routing strategy using the attributes of applications, you can execute specific traffic-management policies that control how packets get forwarded.\n\n\nIn this way, you can optimize how bandwidth gets used by your most important applications.\n\n\nPBR is considered to be an exception to the routing information base (RIB) and is looked at before examining the RIB. This allows for more routing options.\nFor example, within the route map used for PBR, you can match on an access control list (ACL) that then matches on source, destination, protocol type, and/or port numbers.\nYou can also match on:\n• Quality of service (QoS) marking, such as Internet Protocol (IP) precedence or differentiated services code point (DSCP)\n• The size of the packets, effectively enabling you to send data where you want it to go based on how big or small its packets are\nOnce you have a positive match, you can then set the next hop device’s address and/or egress interface. You can also set QoS values at the same time, which enable you to ensure an application gets the resources it needs to function as well as you need it to.",

      "description": "Have you ever wanted to run multiple operating systems on your computer without the hassle of buying extra hardware? Or perhaps you’ve been curious about building your own IT or cybersecurity lab at home? With Oracle VirtualBox, you can do exactly that — and this course will show you how to master it step by step.\nVirtualBox is one of the most powerful, free, and open-source virtualization platforms available today. It allows you to install and run different operating systems — like Windows, Linux, or even specialized OS builds — side by side on your existing computer. Whether you are a beginner exploring virtualization for the first time, a student preparing for IT certifications, or a professional who wants to create isolated test environments, this course is designed to make VirtualBox both simple and practical.\nWe’ll start with the basics: downloading and installing VirtualBox, setting up your very first virtual machine, and understanding how virtual hardware like CPUs, memory, and disks are configured. From there, you’ll quickly move into hands-on work with snapshots, cloning, disk management, and guest additions — tools that will make your virtual machines more powerful and user-friendly.\nBut VirtualBox is more than just creating a VM. This course also dives deep into networking modes. You’ll learn how NAT gives your VMs internet access, how Bridged mode makes your VM act like a “real” computer on your network, how Host-Only provides a private network for experiments, and how Internal networking can isolate VMs completely for safe practice. These lessons are taught through real-world examples so you can see exactly how to apply them in practical scenarios.\nA unique aspect of this course is its focus on building labs that reflect real-world needs. If you’re into cybersecurity, you’ll learn how to safely isolate malware labs or penetration testing environments without risking your host computer. If you’re a developer or tester, you’ll see how to quickly spin up environments for testing your applications across multiple operating systems. If you’re simply a tech enthusiast, you’ll gain the skills to experiment, learn, and even break things — all in a safe, virtual sandbox.\nAlong the way, we’ll also cover key productivity features like shared folders, clipboard integration, and port forwarding, which let you bridge the gap between host and guest systems. You’ll learn how to transfer files seamlessly, connect services running inside your VM to the outside world, and keep your workflow efficient.\nBy the end of the course, you won’t just “know about” VirtualBox — you’ll have practical, hands-on experience using it to create environments tailored to your own goals. You’ll be able to:\nConfidently install and configure VirtualBox on your system.\nCreate, clone, and manage multiple virtual machines.\nUse snapshots to save states and roll back changes instantly.\nSet up virtual networks for connectivity, isolation, or simulation of real-world scenarios.\nShare files and resources between host and guest operating systems.\nBuild complete labs for cybersecurity, networking, testing, or learning new operating systems.\nThis course is beginner-friendly — no prior knowledge of virtualization is required. All you need is a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and some free disk space to comfortably run virtual machines. We’ll walk through everything else step by step.\nSo who is this course for? If you are:\nA student preparing for IT or cybersecurity certifications.\nA developer or tester who needs to run multiple OS environments.\nAn IT professional looking to sharpen your skills and practice in safe environments.\nOr simply a tech enthusiast who enjoys learning new tools and experimenting with systems...\n…then this course is for you.\nBy the time you finish, you’ll have a solid foundation in virtualization with VirtualBox and the confidence to apply it in your studies, work, or personal projects. More importantly, you’ll understand not just “how” to click through menus but also why each feature matters and how to use it effectively.\nVirtualization is one of the most valuable skills in today’s IT world. Whether you’re working with servers, cloud environments, or security labs, virtualization underpins much of modern computing. Learning VirtualBox gives you a safe, cost-effective way to get started — and the knowledge you gain here will translate directly into other platforms and technologies you may use in the future.\nIf you’re ready to take control of your learning environment, explore the power of virtualization, and build labs that prepare you for real-world challenges — then let’s get started.",

The author will show the difference in applying the eigrp under classic format and named format. The author will explain the formula used under both formats. In this course the student will learn about the metric calculation and how the 5 variables are used and the default the K values that are used by default. K1 and K3 are used for metric calculation by EIGRP.  The author will use lab examples in calculating the eigrp metric calculation as part of the traffic engineering.\nThe author will also share important information on criteria to form EIGRP neighborship, these criteria should be met.\n\n\nAutonomous system number should match. (AS is a group of networks running under a single administrative control) .\nauthentication should match (if applied). EIGRP supports MD5 authentication only.\nsubnet mask should be the same.\nHello timer- The interval in which EIGRP sends a hello message on an interface. It is 5 seconds by default. 5.\nDead timer- The interval in which the neighbor will be declared dead if it is not able to send the hello packet. It is 15 seconds by default.\nThe author shows why named eigrp will be used in high speed networks. The course has 4 important labs that cover the injection of default route, summarization, redistribution and stub. The author will configure the labs step by step so the student will learn how to implement the labs.\n\n\nJoin the course and master EIGRP.",

Path Traversal. Forces access to files, directories, and commands that are located outside the web document root directory.\nCISA Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Process. CISA's CVD program coordinates the remediation and public disclosure of newly identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities in products and services with the affected vendor(s).\n\n\n\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of—and remediation guidance for—the top 10 most critical web application security risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world and It is the most prevalent and impactful vulnerability as per the OWASP “Top 10” list.\n\n\nWhat is vulnerability disclosure in cyber security?\nThis Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) describes the activities that can be undertaken by security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in internet-accessible systems and services in a legally authorized manner.\n\n\n\n\nWhy need to learn Information disclosure vulnerabilities?\nLearning to find and exploit information disclosure is a vital skill for any tester. You are likely to encounter it on a regular basis and, once you know how to exploit it effectively, it can help you to improve your testing efficiency and enable you to find additional, high-severity bugs.\nVDPs provide the framework and guidance that enables this. Once a security vulnerability has been disclosed, it can provide organisations with the information required to shape appropriate mitigation steps and decrease the chance of exploitation of the security vulnerability by adversaries.\n\n\nTypes of Information disclosure vulnerabilities\n>>Directory Indexing\n>>Information Leakage\n>>Path Traversal\n>>Predictable Resource Location\n\n\n\n\nHow to prevent Information disclosure\nBad configuration\nusing a poorly designed application\nFails to remove sensitive content from public content\nFor Learn with Fun method encroll this Course!",

      "description": "*** Part of the best selling course: CCNA Cyber Ops Tools: Sec Onion, Wireshark, and Kali Linux ***\n*** The Only standalone course about Sguil and Squert on Udemy***\nIt is estimated that there will be about 1.5 million unfiled jobs in cyber security by the year 2020. A more recent statistic increased this number for cyber security unfilled jobs to be 3.5 million by the year 2021. In addition, recent article highlights Cisco Systems intention to become a cyber security force. For these reasons, Cisco created the CCNA Cyber Ops certification, which can become one of the most certifications in demand in the near future. Furthermore, Cisco created a scholarship program for this certification, which emphasis its importance.\nIn this course you will learn about the tools that you can use for your study of the CCNA Cyber Ops certification and the current Cisco CyberOps Associate certification. Learning the theory side is important, but the hands on side is more important, since the main purpose of your study is to apply your knowledge in production, and since your hands on will enforce your theory knowledge. You can not teach someone how to drive a car by showing him or her how to do it, but you have to let him try and practice how to do that. Furthermore, showing you hands on labs and how to use tools without teaching you how to create these labs and install these tools, might not give you the ultimate benefit from your study . For this reason, I have created this course to teach you how to create your own home labs, and to understand the core usage and important features of the tools used in them. I believe in the saying: \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\". If you have access to online labs, such as that offered by Cisco through their scholarship, you still need to know how to create your own home labs to continue practicing and experimenting, which is what this course will help you to achieve. On the other hand, this course will prepare you to go through these online labs quickly, and with confidence, since you will be familiar with the tools used in them.  And not just online labs, but any other hands on Cyber Ops courses, like what I intend to publish in the near future.\nIn this course you will learn about how to use the tcpreplay command, and where to download PCAP files that can be used with this command to recreate network packets in order to practice with malware analysis using Sguil and Squert. You will go through the steps of exploring Sguil ,pivoting into other security analysis tools, events categorization, and finally do these steps using Squert too.\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your Cyber security journey. Happy learning!",

      "description": "The goal of the course is to master key Python concepts as they are applied in the network engineering context. Computer Networks, large and small, has become ever increasingly software-driven in the last several years. A typical network engineer faces the challenge of learning a completely new discipline that normally takes years to master. This course will use Python, an easy-to-learn, popular first-time-programmer language as the foundation to bridge the gap for network engineers facing the automation challenge, this will help network engineers become experts in using Python for networking. The video will start by demonstrating how to use Python and supported libraries to automate network tasks. Then you will get familiar with the concepts and work with the Ansible framework in order to achieve your network goals. You will then come across ways to monitor your network using Python. Besides this, you will develop a good understanding and explore ways to solve issues related to the security wheel that treats the network as one single entity instead of dispersing components. By the end of the course, the students will master skills required to accomplish advance network automation using Python.\nAll the code and supporting files for this course are available on Github.\nAbout the Author\nEric Chou is a seasoned technologist with over 17 years of experience.

      "description": "Simulation\nSimulator is a computer program or a device that can mimic a real life situation. It can provide outcomes depending on various assumptions and actions without causing any risk. It is a common practice to use a simulator to create electronic devices. Therefore, many universities use simulation software to teach electronic designs. These simulators help to avoid designing faulty circuits. Users can simulate the circuit and view the outputs. After obtaining the required outcomes, they can implement them using the real Integrated Circuits (ICs), breadboards and other components. For example, assume a flight simulator. It is a device that artificially creates an aircraft flying environment. It is mainly used for pilot training as it is risky to train on real aircrafts. Therefore, it is a good alternative to follow a flight simulator. It creates the complete environment of a real aircraft. The pilot can understand how to control it, how it behaves, the effects on the system etc. He can also understand how the aircraft operates to external factors such as turbulence, cloud, air density, etc.\n\n\nEmulation\nAn emulator is a hardware or software that makes one computer system (host) operates similar to another system (guest). In other words, the emulator allows the host system to execute software or use peripheral devices designed for the guest system. Moreover, emulation is the capability of a computer program in an electronic device to emulate another program or device. Android Studio is a common platform to develop android applications. The programmer can create an emulator which appears similar to a real phone and he can execute the developed apps using that emulator. Therefore, it is not compulsory to use an exact phone to test the application. The emulator works as the real phone to check the applications. This is an example for an emulator.\n\n\nVirtualization\nVirtualization is technology that you can use to create virtual representations of servers, storage, networks, and other physical machines. Virtual software mimics the functions of physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine. Businesses use virtualization to use their hardware resources efficiently and get greater returns from their investment. It also powers cloud computing services that help organizations manage infrastructure more efficiently.",

      "description": "A path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to access files on your web server to which they should not have access. They do this by tricking either the web server or the web application running on it into returning files that exist outside of the web root folder.\n\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of—and remediation guidance for—the top 10 most critical web application security risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world.\n\n\nWhat is Directory traversal?\nDirectory traversal is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems, and sensitive operating system files. In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.\nA path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder.\nIt is the second most prevalent and impactful vulnerability as per the OWASP “Top 10” list.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between directory traversal and path traversal?\nThe main difference between a Directory path traversal and the file inclusion vulnerabilities is the ability to execute the source codes that are not saved in interpretable files (like . php or . asp and others)\n\n\n\n\nwhy need to learn Directory traversal vulnerabilities?\nWith a system vulnerable to directory traversal, an attacker can make use of this vulnerability to step out of the root directory and access other parts of the file system. This might give the attacker the ability to view restricted files, which could provide the attacker with more information required to further compromise the system.\nDepending on how the website access is set up, the attacker will execute commands by impersonating himself as the user which is associated with “the website”. Therefore it all depends on what the website user has been given access to in the system\n\n\nHow to prevent Directory traversal attacks\nWhen making calls to the filesystem, you should avoid relying on user input for any part of the path.\nIf you really can’t avoid relying on user input, normalize the information or the path before using it. Then, check that its prefix matches the directory that users are permitted to access.\nProcess URI requests that do not result in a file request\nEnsure that your web server operating system and critical application files are kept separate from each other\nDo not use administrator or superuser accounts to run web servers whose permissions only allow them to read only the files it needs to run\nSo, Join Now to learn with fun way.",

Electronic warfare (which is not to be confused with cyber warfare) has been a staple in modern day warfare, especially since World War II, and it has continued to evolve with more technological advancements. Digital forensics provides an avenue for improved capabilities in such warfare to ensure superiority in the electromagnetic spectrum in order to have an upper hand over adversaries.\nThere has been increased risk of terrorist activity and hybrid warfare, which would involve utilization the electromagnetic spectrum; this puts civilians and businesses at risk; hence basic knowledge and awareness of electronic warfare also helps individuals and organizations improve their readiness and protection. Electronic footprints can be analyzed to determine what kind of threat actor they are exposed to, for taking proper and adequate remedial response and action.\nThe course begins with an introduction to the concept of electronic warfare and highlight of some historical milestones in its development. Then moves to how digital forensics can aid in electronic warfare, indicating where, when and how it is applicable. Some real case examples of where digital forensics was applied in warfare are mentioned in addition to suggestions on potential applications.",

      "description": "Thick client applications are often overlooked in mainstream security training, yet they power some of the most critical systems in finance, healthcare, government, and enterprise networks. These applications interact directly with backend servers, often using proprietary protocols, legacy authentication methods, and unprotected local storage—making them a goldmine for attackers who know how to exploit them.\nOffensive Thick Client Penetration Testing is designed to bridge that gap.\nIn this hands-on course, you'll learn how to identify, analyze, and exploit security flaws in thick client applications through a structured offensive approach. You'll intercept and manipulate traffic between the client and the server, reverse engineer binaries, bypass authentication, exploit insecure storage, and inject malicious code to take control of application logic.\nWe’ll cover key attack vectors like DLL injection, insecure serialization, custom protocol fuzzing, local privilege escalation, and business logic manipulation. You’ll work with real-world tools such as Burp Suite, Wireshark, Ghidra, dnSpy, Procmon, and more.\nWhether you're a red teamer, bug bounty hunter, or security researcher, this course will help you master a critical but underexplored area of application security.\nIf you’re ready to level up and go beyond web and API exploitation, this course is your next step in becoming a complete offensive security expert.",

You will understand how such things happen.\nYou will understand the mechanisms of an important IP feature, which is the Proxy ARP feature.\nYou will understand the disadvantages and security issues related to this feature, the attacks that it allows, and how to mitigate them.\nThis course focuses on the practical side as much as possible, using Cisco routers emulated in GNS3.\nFor example, we will see how the Proxy ARP feature allows hosts that do not use a default gateway to communicate with other subnets or to use a default gateway that is located outside their own subnet. We will see how this feature affects the cache of the devices, and therefore we will understand what the best way is to configure static routing. Additionally, you will see how both DOS (denial of service) and MiTM (Man in the Middle) attacks take advantage of the Proxy ARP feature. However, this feature was not there without a reason, so its usage cases will be explained.\nI hope that you will learn—and enjoy—from this course about how proxy ARP works as an example of networking protocols' mechanisms.

TRAM enables researchers to test and refine Machine Learning (ML) models for identifying ATT&CK techniques in prose-based threat intel reports and allows threat intel analysts to train ML models and validate ML results.\nThrough research into automating the mapping of cyber threat intel reports to ATT&CK, TRAM aims to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of integrating ATT&CK into cyber threat intelligence across the community. Threat intel providers, threat intel platforms, and analysts should be able to use TRAM to integrate ATT&CK more easily and consistently into their products.\nThreat Report ATT&CK Mapper (TRAM) aims to provide a streamlined approach for analyzing reports and extracting ATT&CK techniques. Our hope is that automating mapping to ATT&CK can reduce analyst fatigue, increase ATT&CK coverage, and improve consistency and accuracy of threat intelligence mappings. We are excited to now share a public beta of TRAM with the ATT&CK community.\n\n\nTRAM Under the Hood:\n\n\n1. Get Data : STIX & TAXII >> TIP\n2. Clean the Data.\n3. Train Model.\n4. Collect Reports. >> Report Uploading\n5. Test Data.(Through ML Models).\n6. Accept or Review Model Decisions.(Score & Technique).\n7. Feedback loop.\n\n\nHow TRAM is a Enabler:\n\n\n1. Make it easier to get started with ATT&CK.\n2. Remembering 266+ techniques is hard.>> Not only 266+ but is ever growing..>> MITRE ATT&CK is a Live framework.\n3. Use Reporting which is important.",

It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation or mitigation, if and whenever needed.\n\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of—and remediation guidance for—the top 10 most critical web application security risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world.\n\n\nWhat is broken authentication?\nBroken authentication is a widely used term reflecting a combination of vulnerabilities related to authentication and flawed implementations of session management functionalities. It lets threat agents exploit weaknesses in session and credentials management implementations.\nIt is the second most prevalent and impactful vulnerability as per the OWASP “Top 10” list.\n\n\n6 Common Authentication Vulnerabilities\nSession Hijacking\nBrute Force Attacks\nCredential Stuffing\nWeak Passwords\nPhishing Attacks\nInsecure Authentication Protocols\n\n\nWhat is the difference between authentication and authorization?\nAuthentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be, whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.\n\n\nwhy need to learn authentication vulnerabilities?\nAuthentication vulnerabilities have serious repercussions — whether it's because of weak passwords or poor authentication design and implementation. Malicious users can use these vulnerabilities to get access into systems and user accounts to: Steal sensitive information. Masquerade as a legitimate user.\n\n\nTypes of broken authentication attacks\n> Session hijacking attack\n> Session ID URL rewriting attack\n> Session fixation attack\n\n\nHow to prevent broken authentication attacks\nControl session length\nRotate and invalidate session IDs\nDo not put session IDs in URLs\nSo, Join quackly to Learn with Fun.",

      "description": "Welcome to the CyberSecurity Basics course, organized by Exprivia Spa and created by Digital Factory Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity is a crucial topic in today’s world, where the Internet plays a central role in various aspects of our lives—social, professional, economic, and political.\nProtecting the networks we use daily is essential, whether for simple activities like sending an email or sharing opinions on social media, or more sensitive operations like job searching or financial transactions. As technology becomes an integral part of our routine, it is vital to implement security measures to prevent sensitive information—such as banking details or confidential personal data—from being stolen by malicious actors.\nCyber threats affect both individuals and companies: while a private user may risk having their bank account credentials stolen, a company could be exposed to cyber espionage. But how can we ensure cybersecurity in these situations?\nThis course will provide you with fundamental knowledge to adopt effective behaviors that help prevent cyber threats, such as those spread through phishing or vishing emails. You will also gain an understanding of how, even if a hacker is not directly interested in your data, they could still exploit your device as part of a large-scale cyberattack on critical infrastructure, such as a power plant, causing widespread disruptions.\nCourse Overview:\nIntroduction to Cybersecurity\nThe Weakest Link in the Chain (Phishing and Vishing)\nThe Most Common Threats (Viruses, Spyware, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware, Adware, and other online threats)\nBest Practices for Cybersecurity\nImportance of antivirus software and updates\nHow to check if a website is safe\nPatch Management\nAnalyzing attachments, email headers, and documents",

File Manipulation\nNow that we know the basics of Golang, let's dive in and learn\nabout file manipulation, reading, writing, listing, permissions, etc.\nSince this is a Ransomware course, it's important to know about\nfiles, don't you agree?\n4. Hash\nHere we will learn a little about Hash, md5, base64, sha256\namong others.\n5. Advanced encryption\nIn this module, we will start to make the content more difficult, the\nstudent will learn in depth the basic and advanced knowledge\nabout symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, many used in\nfamous Ransomware, AES, RSA, CHACHA20.\n6. Sandbox\nLet's learn a little about sandbox environments for evasion\nprocesses, creating several functions that we can detect if our\nmalware is running in test environments.\n7. Running processes\nIn real ransomware, there is a list of running processes, this step\nis important, the objective is to know which processes we must kill\nfor the malware to run.\n8. Infosystem\nIn this module, we will talk about collecting information from our\n“Targets”, hostname, username, addresses, permission, OS.9. About Logs\nIn this module, we will learn about logs stored on our targets and\nhow we can “eliminate” them, an important process in the attack\nto erase traces.\n10. README\nHere we will learn how to create our famous warning banner, the\none that all ransomware has: “All your files have been encrypted,\ndo not attempt to recover them………”",

      "description": "This course explores the IEC 62443 standard with a strong emphasis on securing the integration and maintenance phases of industrial automation and control systems (IACS). Designed to address the needs of service providers, it highlights their responsibility in ensuring cybersecurity during system implementation and ongoing operations. The course emphasizes the often-overlooked aspects of IEC 62443, particularly those beyond the widely discussed product supplier requirements. While much of the attention surrounding IEC 62443 has been focused on product suppliers and the certification of commercial off-the-shelf automation and control system products, the operational realities at industrial sites tell a different story.\nFor asset owners and plant managers, no unified cybersecurity assessment scheme for operational technology  exists. Instead, they often rely on a patchwork of third-party solutions that may not align with Industrial Control System security best practices. This fragmented approach can leave critical infrastructure vulnerable, despite advancements in securing products. By focusing on these gaps, the course equips service providers with the knowledge and tools to address these challenges, aligning their processes with industry standards to ensure robust cybersecurity not only at the product level but also in real-world, operational contexts.\nIf you are new to the IEC 62443 standard or seeking a broader, introductory perspective, I recommend starting with my other course, \"Hands-On ISA/IEC 62443: Securing Industrial Systems,\" which covers the fundamental concepts, risk management, and the certification of industrial products. However, if you already have experience with the standard and are looking to enhance your understanding of service provider responsibilities and security at the operational level, this course is the perfect fit.",

This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server. The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.\n\n\nIn this short course, I will help you understand basics of Virtualization and configure various features available in Oracle VirtualBox. . This course is set up to give the student an understanding of the components that make up a virtual environment. You will grasp the concept of what virtualization is and how it is used in corporate and in home environments.

One day he received an email from a client with an invoice attached, but soon after opening it, his computer started to act strange. Messages popped up on his screen, his desktop background changed, and he couldnt open any of the client files saved on his hard drives.\n\n\nBecause of this he was unable to proces any of his clients accounts, and as it was coming up to a tax deadline, his clients were faced with fines due to late and overdue filings. And because of that, his firm took a knock to its reputation which made some of his clients leave and scared others away from working with him. It was a very stressful and worrying time for him.\n\n\nHe finally had to call in a computer specialist firm to help and try restore his data, but this cost him tens of thousands, and as his backups were not up to date, there were many late hours spent manually re-entering data into his systems. And even with that, there was a lot of client data which simply could not be restored.\n\n\nThese days, if you look at how he has set up his IT systems, you will see many layers of redundancy and security at play, and has a full Disaster Recovery plan in place to quickly overcome and IT disaster that could threaten his livelihood again.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn how to recognise any gaps in the security of your IT systems and what you can do to plug them. By reducing your risk of cyber attack, you will not only protect your revenue and brand reputation, but also minimise the cost, scale and impact of any cyber attack if it does happen in the future.",

These examples demonstrate the depth and clarity you can expect from our full course.\nQuestion: Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for error detection and correction?\nA) Physical Layer\nB) Data Link Layer\nC) Network Layer\nD) Transport Layer\nAnswer: B) Data Link Layer\nExplanation: The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model plays a critical role in error detection and correction. It ensures reliable transmission of data across the physical network by employing mechanisms like frame synchronization, MAC addressing, and error control. Error control includes both error detection and error correction, which are achieved through techniques like parity checks and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). These processes help identify and rectify errors that might occur at the physical layer, enhancing overall data integrity.\nQuestion: In a network using IPv4 addressing, what is the purpose of subnetting?\nA) To enhance network security\nB) To reduce the number of IP addresses needed\nC) To divide an IP network into multiple network segments\nD) To increase the speed of the network\nAnswer: C) To divide an IP network into multiple network segments\nExplanation: Subnetting, in the context of IPv4, is the process of dividing a single network into multiple smaller, more manageable network segments or sub-networks. This practice allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, reducing the wastage associated with large address blocks. Subnetting enhances network organization, improves security by isolating network segments, and can improve performance by reducing local traffic. However, its primary purpose is not to increase the speed of the network or reduce the overall number of IP addresses but to create logically segmented networks within a larger network.\nQuestion: What is the primary function of a network firewall?\nA) To act as a distribution point for data packets\nB) To connect multiple network segments\nC) To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic\nD) To provide dynamic IP addresses to devices\nAnswer: C) To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic\nExplanation: A network firewall serves as a security barrier between your internal network and external sources, such as the internet. Its primary function is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. By doing so, firewalls help prevent unauthorized access to or from a network, safeguarding data and resources. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both, and are essential components in a comprehensive network security strategy.\nQuestion: Which protocol is used to securely manage network devices remotely?\nA) HTTP\nB) SNMP\nC) SSH\nD) FTP\nAnswer: C) SSH\nExplanation: Secure Shell (SSH) is the protocol used for securely accessing network devices remotely. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, enabling network administrators to log into another computer over the network, execute commands in a remote machine, and move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network such as the internet. SSH is widely used for managing network infrastructure and systems due to its robust security features.\nQuestion: What does the term 'QoS' stand for in networking, and what is its primary purpose?\nA) Quality of Service; to ensure efficient data transfer\nB) Quick Operating System; to speed up network device operations\nC) Query Optimization System; to enhance database queries over a network\nD) Queue of Signals; to manage data packet queuing\nAnswer: A) Quality of Service; to ensure efficient data transfer\nExplanation: Quality of Service (QoS) in networking refers to the various technologies and techniques used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure the efficient transmission of data. The primary purpose of QoS is to provide priority, including dedicated bandwidth, controlled jitter and latency (required by some real-time and interactive traffic), and improved loss characteristics. It is used to ensure that the most important data gets through the network as quickly and smoothly as possible, even in high traffic situations or when bandwidth is limited. QoS is crucial in networks that handle a mix of critical applications, voice, video, and data traffic.\nEnroll in the Ultimate Networking Interview Questions: Master Your Practice Tests course today and take the first step towards acing your networking interviews!",

      "description": "This 200-word course provides a comprehensive exploration of the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol, a cornerstone of network security and AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) frameworks. Designed for software engineers and network professionals, the curriculum demystifies RADIUS architecture, packet exchange workflows (e.g., Access-Request, Access-Accept/Reject), and its critical role in securing access to VPNs, Wi-Fi networks, and enterprise systems.\nLearn to configure RADIUS servers for centralized user management, integrating seamlessly with directories like LDAP and Active Directory. Delve into authentication methods (EAP, PAP, CHAP), certificate-based security (EAP-TLS), and encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive credentials. Practical modules include Wireshark-based packet analysis to diagnose authentication failures, latency issues, and protocol vulnerabilities. Explore RADIUS accounting for tracking user sessions and resource usage, vital for compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).\nThe course emphasizes real-world applications: automating AAA workflows with Python scripts, deploying RADIUS in hybrid cloud environments (AWS/Azure), and enforcing dynamic access policies (VLAN assignments, QoS tagging). Hands-on labs simulate scenarios like mitigating rogue access points, troubleshooting RADIUS-DHCP conflicts, and hardening servers against brute-force attacks.\nKey Outcomes:\nMaster RADIUS protocol mechanics and AAA implementation.\nSecure network access with advanced authentication/authorization controls.\nTroubleshoot and optimize RADIUS for scalability and compliance.\nBridge software development with network security best practices.\nPrerequisites: Basic networking (TCP/IP, VLANs) and familiarity with Linux/Python.",

      "description": "Building detection is a complex task, especially with a constantly increasing amount of data sources. Keeping track of these data sources and their appropriate detection rules or avoiding duplicate detection rules covering the same techniques can give a hard time to detection engineers.\nFor a SOC, it is crucial to have an good overview and a clear understanding of its actual visibility and detection coverage in order to identify gaps, prioritize the development of new detection rules or onboard new data sources.\nDeTT&CT stands for Detect Tactics, Techniques & Combat Threats. This framework has been created at the Cyber Defence Center of Rabobank and is developed and at the time of writing maintained by Marcus Bakker and Ruben Bouman.\nThe purpose of DeTT&CT is to assist blue teams using MITRE ATT&CK to score and compare data log source quality, visibility coverage and detection coverage. By using this framework, blue teams can quickly detect gaps in the detection or visibility coverage and prioritize the ingest of new log sources.\nDeTT&CT delivers a framework than can map the information you have on the entities available in ATT&CK and help you manage your blue teams data, visibility, and detection coverage.\nData Sources:\nData sources are the raw logs or events generated by systems, e.g., security appliances, network devices, and endpoints. ATT&CK has over 30 different data sources which are further divided into over 90 data components. All those data components are included in this framework. These data sources are administered within the data source administration YAML file. For each data source, among others, the data quality can be scored. Within ATT&CK, these data sources are listed within the techniques themselves (e.g. T1003 in the Detection section).",

      "description": "This advanced-level course is designed to help cybersecurity professionals prepare for the OffSec PEN 300: OSEP (Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester) certification by Offensive Security. The OSEP certification focuses on evasion techniques, advanced post-exploitation, and red team operations in real-world, hardened environments.\nThe course includes six expertly structured domains, each simulating hands-on attack chains and penetration testing scenarios. Through challenging multiple-choice and select-all-that-apply questions, students will reinforce critical skills such as payload development, antivirus evasion, credential access, lateral movement, and full kill-chain operations. Each domain includes topics directly mapped to PEN-300 labs and objectives.\n\n\nDomain 1: Client-Side Exploitation & Execution Theory\nThis domain lays the foundation for modern client-side attacks. Students will exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and JScript-based environments, understand Windows internals, and craft obfuscated payloads to bypass basic antivirus protection.\nKey Areas:\nMemory management, shellcode, and Windows API concepts\nOffice macro exploitation and social engineering\nJScript and HTA-based payload execution\nStatic AV evasion techniques and simple packers\n\n\nDomain 2: Injection, Migration, and Advanced Antivirus Evasion\nThis domain teaches advanced evasion and stealth. Students will explore deep process injection, memory-only execution, and AV/EDR evasion techniques using custom crypters and signature bypasses. Application whitelisting restrictions will be bypassed using trusted binaries.\nKey Areas:\nDLL and shellcode injection (reflective, hollowing, early bird)\nInline hooking and direct syscall usage\nAV/EDR bypass using encryption, staging, and API unhooking\nAppLocker/SRP bypass via LOLBins and signed proxy execution\n\n\nDomain 3: Network Evasion, Kiosk Breakouts & Lateral Movement\nThis domain simulates perimeter defense bypass, restricted environment exploitation, and initial steps in post-compromise network movement. You will use covert channels to tunnel through firewalls and escape kiosk-mode systems, followed by lateral movement across Windows networks.\nKey Areas:\nDNS tunneling, SOCKS proxies, and port forwarding tools (e.g., chisel)\nKiosk breakout via allowed binaries and USB payloads\nWindows trust abuse: SMB, WinRM, PsExec, and WMI\nKerberos ticket attacks and token impersonation\n\n\nDomain 4: Linux & Windows Post-Exploitation and Credential Access\nFocusing on post-compromise dominance, this domain teaches the manipulation of Linux and Windows hosts. Learners will extract credentials, escalate privileges, establish persistence, and move laterally across multi-OS environments.\nKey Areas:\nLinux and Windows persistence (cron, WMI, registry, startup abuse)\nCredential dumping using Mimikatz, memory analysis, and SAM extraction\nSSH key abuse and sudo misconfigurations\nMulti-platform lateral movement strategies\n\n\nDomain 5: SQL Server and Active Directory Attacks\nStudents will exploit Microsoft SQL Server and Active Directory environments to escalate privileges and gain domain control. This includes command execution via SQL injection and privilege abuse in domain-wide trust relationships.\nKey Areas:\nxp_cmdshell and linked server exploitation\nLateral movement via MSSQL misconfigurations\nKerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and unconstrained delegation\nDCSync, GPO abuse, and full domain compromise\n\n\nDomain 6: Complex Multi-Stage Attacks & Red Team Simulation\nThis final domain simulates real-world red team operations. Students will apply the techniques from earlier domains to craft full kill chains involving phishing, evasion, pivoting, credential theft, and exfiltration within hardened enterprise environments.\nKey Areas:\nMulti-vector attack chaining and pivoting\nRed team OPSEC and blue team evasion\nAdvanced tooling (Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Covenant)\nEnd-to-end offensive campaigns across segmented networks\nWho Should Enroll?\nThis course is designed for experienced penetration testers, red team operators, and OSCP-certified professionals preparing for the OSEP certification. It is also valuable for blue teamers seeking deeper insight into offensive TTPs.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Offensive Security.

      "description": "“Setting Up an IT Network Lab at Home on a Budget” is a ten-module lecture-style program that transforms the idea of a spare-room “test bench” into a fully documented, enterprise-style network environment - without the enterprise-level price tag.\nThe course opens with Module 1, where we clarify five core objectives: helping you assemble a functional lab at minimal cost; teaching you how to choose the right mix of hardware, software, and licensing; coaching you through smart budgeting and deal hunting; walking you step-by-step through installation and configuration; and, finally, demonstrating real-world use cases that turn your lab into a springboard for certifications, career progression, and side-projects.\nAfter outlining those goals, Module 1 also highlights why a home lab pays dividends: it delivers true hands-on skill development in areas such as network segmentation, server hardening, and virtualization; it boosts employability by letting you rehearse interview scenarios with live equipment; it provides a safe sandbox for testing bleeding-edge technologies; and it does all of this while leveraging refurbished gear, open-source software, and free cloud-tier credits to keep costs low.\nThe remainder of the syllabus builds logically from planning through continuous improvement. You will define lab requirements and map them to a realistic budget (Modules 2–3), learn how to select routers, switches, servers, NICs, and peripherals that maximize performance per dollar (Module 4), and explore operating systems, network utilities, and virtualization stacks that deliver the greatest learning value at zero or near-zero licensing cost (Module 5). Dedicated lessons on sourcing gear (Module 6) help you to not overpay, while hands-on build labs (Module 7) and maintenance playbooks (Module 8) keep your environment stable and secure. Finally, real-world application stories (Module 9) and a final action plan (Module 10) help you showcase your new skill set to employers or clients.\nBy course end, you’ll possess a scalable, budget-optimized lab blueprint - and the confidence to adapt it as technology and your career evolve.",

EVN uses existing Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF)-Lite technology to:\n\n\nSimplify Layer 3 network virtualization\nImprove shared services support\nEnhance management, troubleshooting, and usability\nWhat Problems Does It Help Solve?\nEVN reduces network virtualization configuration significantly across the entire network infrastructure with the Virtual Network Trunk. The traditional VRF-Lite solution requires creating one sub interface per VRF on all switches and routers involved in the data path, creating a lot of burden in configuration management.\n\nEVN removes the need of per VRF sub interface by using “vnet trunk” command. This helps reduce the amount provisioning across the network infrastructure\nEVN enhances network virtualization troubleshooting by making VRF-Lite easier to deploy, operate, and scale. A routing context command mode allows network operators to perform troubleshooting issues that pertain specifically within a VRF without specifying the VRF name in every command.",

So you will feel very curious day by day by following this course.\nIf you are feeling that you don't know about kernel at all don't worry I have made this course such a way that you will not stuck at any point because I have started from very basics as to keep in mind that the learner does'nt know about kernel at all.\nWhat are kernel rootkits:\nA kernel rootkit is a type of malicious software that is designed to operate at the kernel level of an operating system. It is designed to remain hidden and to operate without the knowledge or consent of the user.\nKernel rootkits are very dangerous and can be very difficult to detect and remove, because they operate at such a low level of the operating system.\nThey have full access to control all the system resources, including memory, I/O, and system calls, and can intercept and modify system calls to hide their own actions.\nKernel rootkits can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system, to steal sensitive information, or to disrupt the operation of the system.\nThey can also be used to create a \"backdoor\" into a system, allowing an attacker to regain access at a later time.\nLearning about kernel security and how they work can help individuals and organizations to better understand and defend against these types of threats.\nFor example, understanding the techniques and tactics used by rootkits can help security professionals to design more effective defenses and to identify and mitigate rootkit infections.

That means knowing the majority of SPLK-3001 content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they’ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the SPLK-3001 but it may take some extra work.\n\nThe exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It’s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you’ll study! Don’t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.",

To compensate, some NGFW’s will try to supplement their first-generation intrusion prevention with a series of non-integrated add-on products. However, this approach does little to protect your business against the risks posed by sophisticated attackers and advanced malware. Further, once you do get infected, they offer no assistance in scoping the infection, containing it, and remediating quickly.\nProtect Your Organization Before, During, and After an Attack The Cisco Firepower NGFW includes the industry’s most widely deployed stateful firewall and provides granular control over more than 4,000 commercial applications. Its single management interface delivers unified visibility from the network to the endpoint. Firepower NGFW enables comprehensive policy management that controls access, stops attacks, defends against malware and provides integrated tools to track, contain and recover from attacks that do get through.",

Led by Dr. Amar Massoud, a seasoned expert with decades of academic and professional experience, it combines cutting-edge AI support with human insight to deliver content that is precise, practical, and easy to follow. You’ll gain the clarity of structured learning and the confidence of being guided by a recognized authority.\nCybersecurity professionals face increasing pressure to comply with multiple frameworks while minimizing duplication and costs. Two of the most widely recognized standards are ISO/IEC 27001:2022, which defines how to establish and maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS), and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) with NIST SP 800-53, which provides detailed technical security controls. Alone, each framework is powerful, but together they create a comprehensive and unified approach that strengthens governance and enhances operational security.\nThis course is designed to give you practical strategies to integrate ISO 27001 and NIST efficiently. You’ll learn how to map ISO clauses and Annex A controls to NIST CSF functions and SP 800-53 control families, align risk management practices using ISO 27005 and the NIST Risk Management Framework, and harmonize documentation so that a single set of policies, records, and evidence satisfies both frameworks.\nWe’ll also dive into the implementation roadmap, showing how to move from gap analysis to full deployment, manage stakeholders, and leverage GRC tools for dual-framework compliance. You’ll gain the skills to prepare for ISO certification audits while simultaneously demonstrating NIST alignment, reducing audit fatigue, and improving efficiency.\nFinally, you’ll explore common challenges, best practices, and future trends, including the rise of continuous control monitoring (CCM) and AI-driven compliance platforms. These insights will help you anticipate change and position your organization for long-term resilience.\nBy the end of the course, you will be confident in leading or contributing to integration projects, ensuring your organization can demonstrate compliance, strengthen its security posture, and streamline governance.",

      "description": "This course provides a comprehensive study of process injection and process migration techniques, essential for understanding advanced malware behavior and penetration testing. Participants will explore how attackers use these techniques to execute malicious code, bypass security measures, and evade detection.\n\n\nThe course covers a range of key techniques, including Classic Process Injection, Process Hollowing, Unhooking AV Hooks, and Unhooking AV ntdll.dll using PerunsFart. These methods allow attackers to stealthily manipulate and hijack legitimate processes. Students will also learn advanced concepts such as Section Mapping, where memory regions are manipulated for stealthy code execution, and Thread Context manipulation to hijack thread execution.\n\n\nAdditionally, participants will explore Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs), which allow attackers to queue code execution within a target process, adding to their toolkit of stealth techniques. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how these techniques are used in real-world attacks and how defenders can detect and mitigate them.\n\n\nThrough hands-on labs and case studies, students will gain practical experience in both the offensive use of these techniques and defensive measures, such as behavioral monitoring and memory analysis. The course will also explore detection strategies using modern tools and methodologies like advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.\n\n\nBy the end, participants will have a deep understanding of process injection and migration, equipping them to defend against these sophisticated attack methods.\nPrerequisites: Basic knowledge of operating systems, programming, and cybersecurity fundamentals.",

The topologies are very much self-explanatory and created in different environments (mostly PnetLab, a free tool compatible with Eve-NG) but they can be very easily created on real gear. There would be minor differences in syntax based on the image that you use on your device (or simulated environment).\nAll the commands are explained in detail. I have tried not to miss anything and I have given the reasons you might want to implement a feature or execute a commands so that you can decide your design.\n\n\nSyllabus:\nThe course contains (but is not limited to):\nwhat you should do when you receive a new switch\nhow to do basic configurations\nISL and Dot1q protocols and how to configure access and trunk ports (dynamically or statically)\nhow to configure VLANs\nVTP protocol features and how to configure different versions\nPAgP and LACP protocols and how to configure link aggregation\nLoop-free switched network and how to configure Spanning Tree Protocol variations (STP, RSTP, MSTP, MST)\nSpanning Tree Protocol extra features (LoopGuard, BPDUGuard, BPDUFilter, ...)\nPort Security features and configuration\nFirst Hop Redundancy Protocols (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP) in detail\nand many tips and tricks!\nLectures would be added on demand to the course to make it richer and more valuable to you.

Of course, you will have to study this course with full concentration in order to save your time after the course. This is not rocket science, it's just same configurations, but on different devices and in different directions.\nFeel free to clear your doubts in the QA session provided by Udemy. I will try my best to answer your questions so that your doubts are crystal clear.\nPlease read the file on basic to intermediate configurations in Cisco IOS Routers. If you need more configurations, please let me know, I will try to add them.\nAll the best.",

You will learn about VirtualBox's network adapters.\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to:\nuse and install Oracle VirtualBox on Linux and Windows.\ncreate a shared folder.\ncreate a snapshot and import/export a VM.\nenable and use USB pass through.\n\n\nIn order to complete this course and use VirtualBox, students will need the following: (from VirtualBox's Documentation):\nReasonably powerful x86 hardware. Any recent Intel or AMD processor will do.\nMemory. Depending on what guest operating systems you want to run, you will need at least 512 MB of RAM (but probably more, and the more the better). Basically, you will need whatever your host operating system needs to run comfortably, plus the amount that the guest operating system needs. So, if you want to run Windows 8.1 on Windows 7, you probably won't enjoy the experience much with less than 2 GB of RAM. Check the minimum RAM requirements of the guest operating system, they often will refuse to install if it is given less. Sometimes it malfunctions instead. So you'll need that for the guest alone, plus the memory your operating system normally needs.\nHard disk space. While VirtualBox itself is very lean (a typical installation will only need about 30 MB of hard disk space), the virtual machines will require fairly huge files on disk to represent their own hard disk storage. So, to install Windows 8, for example, you will need a file that will easily grow to several 10 GB in size.\nA supported host operating system. Presently, we support Windows, many Linux distributions, Mac OS X, Solaris and OpenSolaris. Check the user manual of the VirtualBox version you are using which versions are supported. For the latest VirtualBox version, see manual.\nA supported guest operating system. Besides the user manual (see below), up-to-date information is available at \"Status: Guest OSes\".After you learn how to use VirtualBox you should be able to install multiple operating systems like Windows and other Linux distros.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBonus: I'll also show you were to download and how to import free windows VMs for developmental use.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "description": "This practical, hands-on course was created for newbies – that's to say, people with no prior training or knowledge in hacking and cybersecurity.\n\n\nThe aim of this course is to give you the education not just to understand what black-hat hatters do and how, but also to learn exactly how to hack systems like a pro and win the cat and mouse game by securing systems like a professional security expert.\nBlending practical work with solid theoretical training, we take you from the basics of ethical hacking through to mastery, giving you the training you need not just to hack, but also to secure against a hack.\nWhile the theory is important, we understand that it can also be dry and uninspiring. For this reason, this course is packed with examples that you can follow. This practical focus starts from the beginning, where we will teach you about penetration testing and show you how to install the software required (Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) and jump right into hacking.\nThroughout, you will analyze and exploit various systems from regular websites through to sprawling networks, along with hacking servers and clients. More than just hacking, you'll also learn how to conduct efficient penetration testing techniques.\nThis approach gives you the foundational education that you need not just to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin. The course covers six main areas:\n\n\n1: LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS NECESSARY TO BECOME A HACKER\nThis foundational section gives you a full introduction to the basics of networking systems – how they communicate and work – and is designed to give you the knowledge you need to succeed in this course.\nBASICS OF NETWORKING: Networking can be an intimidating topic, but don’t worry! We break down only the necessary things that you need to know in regards to networking and teach you important networking fundamentals\nSETTING UP A HACKING LAB: You can’t hack without a lab! We walk you step-by-step through the process of setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer!\nLINUX + SCRIPTING BASICS: Hackers use Linux, which is an OS that the average person may have no experience with. We will go over Linux fundamentals so that you can easily navigate your way through Linux during this course. We also touch on a couple of scripting languages that are a MUST for any ethical hacker and teach you the basics of each one with practical examples.\nHIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE WEB: If you are hacking on the internet, you need to learn how to remain anonymous. We will show you the tools and techniques that you can use to always remain anonymous and unknown on the internet.\n\n\n2: LEARN HOW TO HACK NETWORKS\nThis section shows you how to test both wired and wireless systems. You will learn how to go from not having any access to a network to gaining access and being able to begin attacking systems on the network.\nPRE-CONNECTION ATTACK: Not all attacks require you to be connected to the target or even know the password. Learn how to discover and manipulate devices connected to a network and gather information about your target\nGAIN ACCESS TO NETWORKS: Learn how to use the information you have about your target to crack the key and get the access password. This section covers multiple protocols including WEP, WPA, and WPA2\nPOST-CONNECTION ATTACKS: With a key, you can now leverage powerful hacking techniques to get even more information. Learn how to see what users are doing on a network, inject code in pages, and more on wired and wireless networks\n\n\n3: HOW TO GAIN ACCESS AND CONNECT TO NETWORKS\nThis section builds on the lessons learned in section one, showing you how you can get full control and hack into any computer system that you target.\nSERVER-SIDE ATTACK: Discover how to harvest information about your targeted system – its OS, open ports, and installed services – without user interaction. Then use this information to exploit vulnerabilities and generate reports\nCLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems with no vulnerabilities by sneaking in with software updates or using backdoor trojan downloads. You’ll also learn the art of social engineering – or tricking people into giving you information\n\n\n4: HOW TO LEVERAGE POST EXPLOITATION\nThis section shifts the focus on interacting with compromised systems. Now that you have gained access, you'll learn how you can exploit these systems.\nACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems have a wealth of files that you can now manipulate with your access. Learn how to access these systems and how to read, write, upload, and even execute files\nMAINTAIN ACCESS: Gaining access to a system and its files is only half of the battle. Learn how to maintain your access and frustrate efforts to secure it again so you can continue to exploit a system\nSPY ON YOUR TARGET: Learn how to capture any keystrokes on a keyboard, turn on a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take control of the system to attack, hack, and access third-party networks and systems\n\n\n5: HOW TO HACK WEBSITES AND WEB APPS\nIn this section, you will learn more about how you can hack into websites and web applications using Kali Linux. You’ll also learn how web applications work – and how to find vulnerabilities within these applications for you to exploit.\nHow to scan websites/web applications for vulnerabilities to exploit\nHow to Brute Force into web applications\nHow to conduct SQL injection in web applications\nHow to conduct Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nHow to exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities\nHow to exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities\nHow to automate attacking web applications using various tools\nHow to prevent and secure websites & apps yourself\n\n\n6: HOW TO MAKE MONEY, LAND A JOB & BUILD A BRAND AS A HACKER\nIn this section, you will learn how you can make money as an ethical hacker using a variety of methods. You’ll also learn how to build your personal brand and get your name out there as an Ethical Hacker so you can have employers and clients knocking at your door ready to hire you for your services. Then finally, you’ll learn how you can start a career in cybersecurity with some insider tips on what certifications to get and the best way to land a job.\nThis includes:\nHow to build an ethical hacker personal brand from scratch\nHow to get instant credibility and authority as a hacker\nHow to properly network and get others talking about you\nHow to make money using a variety of websites\nHow to get started freelancing as a hacker\nHow to get started consulting as a hacker\nHow to land a job as a cybersecurity professional\nThis course is comprehensive, showing you both sides of hacking. You will learn to think and operate like a hacker – and how to apply that knowledge as a cybersecurity expert to protect you and your clients' networks and systems. In taking this 'cat and mouse' approach, your rounded understanding will give your approach new depths and angles, revealing the paths you can take to effectively neutralize any threat.\nTogether with the emphasis on practical examples that you can follow in real life with live systems, you will also benefit from the excitement of hands-on learning. By experiencing precisely what it takes to hack into any given target system, you'll also learn that no one system is the same and that all approaches can be modified.\nThis real-life learning is an invaluable part of your education, enabling you to better see what hackers are doing and how to block even the most potent attacks. No matter what the scenario or how complicated a hacking situation, this course gives you the foundational training you need to secure a network – and start pursuing a career in a field that is increasingly in demand as the global reliance on technology grows.",

      "description": "Cybercrime has surged into a multibillion-dollar industry, projected to cost the global economy $13 trillion annually by 2028.¹ Security breaches hit headlines almost weekly, yet far more incidents never make the news. Meanwhile, an estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity positions remain unfilled worldwide, and employers list CompTIA Security+ as one of the most-requested baseline credentials. In short: defenders are in demand, and the gate is wide open for those prepared to step in.\nThis course is crafted to help you claim that opportunity. Anchored to the newest CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 objectives, it walks you through the modern threat landscape and the defensive strategies every organization now needs. You’ll begin with the building blocks—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—then zoom out to see how those principles drive decisions in real clouds, hybrid networks, and on-prem data centers. By threading concept and context together, the program ensures you grasp not only what each control does but why it matters and how it fits into a bigger security architecture.\nAlong the way we weave in up-to-date cyber statistics, real breach timelines, and analyst insights, so the lessons stay tied to current events rather than static textbook examples. When we discuss identity management, you’ll see how misconfigured authentication paved the way for a recent ransomware assault on a global manufacturing firm. When we explore infrastructure as code, you’ll learn how a single overlooked variable in a deployment template exposed terabytes of customer data at a major retailer. Each story serves as a springboard into practical mitigation steps: reducing attack surface, enforcing least privilege, segmenting networks, encrypting everywhere, and baking security into continuous-delivery pipelines.\nCoverage is intentionally broad yet cohesive. You’ll examine risk evaluation frameworks, secure software lifecycles, cryptography fundamentals, incident triage, digital forensics, governance, and compliance drivers. Specialized modules dig into cloud shared-responsibility boundaries, microservices hardening, serverless pitfalls, container escape defenses, and the unique challenges of operational-technology environments where downtime can threaten public safety. To keep the journey accessible, every complex term is decoded in plain language first, then reinforced with diagrams and step-through demonstrations.\nBut knowledge alone isn’t enough—competence comes from doing. Throughout the course you’ll be guided through optional virtual labs and downloadable walkthroughs that mirror exam scenarios: dissecting packet captures, configuring SIEM alerts, mapping threats to controls, locking down an S3 bucket, tuning intrusion-prevention rules, and practicing disaster-recovery drills. If you don’t have a powerful laptop, low-resource alternatives and free cloud tiers are suggested so no learner gets left behind.\nThe final stretch focuses on test readiness and career transition. You’ll receive study tips tailored to adaptive exam domains, sample performance-based question breakdowns, and a structured revision plan timed to the official scoring rubric. We’ll also explore resume positioning, interview talking points, and the certification stack that often follows Security+—whether that’s CySA+, CASP+, or cloud-provider specializations.\nBy the time you complete the journey, you’ll have two outcomes: first, a solid toolkit for passing the Security+ exam; second, a practical mindset for spotting weaknesses, choosing proportionate controls, and communicating risk in any organization—skills that transfer instantly from classroom to SOC, audit team, or DevSecOps pipeline.\nThe cyber threat curve isn’t slowing down, and neither should your readiness to meet it. Enroll, dive deep, and emerge prepared to defend.",

Take a route that is proven to work, and that requires miniminal on-site skills during installation, and allows ultra-simple logisitics.\nWe provide line-by-line code and config walkthroughs so you will fully understand how the code works and what it is doing, such that you can either use it unchanged with confidence, or adapt it to your needs.  Lectures 4 and 5 provide all the source code files and configuration files as downloadable resources on the Udemy course page.",

      "description": "Shell Injection (also known as OS command injection ) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and all its data.\n\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of—and remediation guidance for—the top 10 most critical web application security risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world.\n\n\nWhat is OS command injection?\nAn OS command injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands directly on the server. If you haven't already realized, if an attacker is able to execute malicious code on the server, he could easily get a reverse shell or a backdoor into the server.\nSo finding Os command injection during bug-bounty and penetration is marked as a critical vulnerability and It is the most prevalent and impactful vulnerability as per the OWASP “Top 10” list.\n\n\nWhy need to learn OS command injection?\nOperating system (OS) command injection is one of the most common web application security vulnerabilities around. It allows a threat actor to run malicious shell commands by targeting an application weakness with improper input validation, such as a buffer overflow.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between Code Injection vs. Command Injection?\nCode injection is a generic term for any type of attack that involves an injection of code interpreted/executed by an application. This type of attack takes advantage of mishandling of untrusted data inputs. It is made possible by a lack of proper input/output data validation.\nOn the other hand, Command injection typically involves executing commands in a system shell or other parts of the environment. The attacker extends the default functionality of a vulnerable application, causing it to pass commands to the system shell, without needing to inject malicious code. In many cases, command injection gives the attacker greater control over the target system.\n\n\nTypes of OS command injection attacks\n>Arbitrary command injection\n>Insecure serialization\n>XML external entity injection (XXE)\n>Arbitrary file uploads/inclusion\n>Server-side template injection (SSTI)\n\n\nHow to prevent  OS command injection\nAvoid system calls and user\ninputSet up input validation\nCreate a white list\nCreate a white lis\nUse execFile() securely\nIf you wanna lean and make a careear as a Ethical hacker, jon with Us.",

In this time I have realized how important it is for the sector and the great benefits that it entails for a company. For this same reason I felt the need to create quality content about the subject, and thus facilitate and above all speed up and accelerate the learning process, compressing all the content in less than 1 hour. You can always learn more, but this course will help you build the foundations of SIP and Asterisk successfully, easily and quickly.\nThe important thing about the course is that you will not only watch and listen, but you will also do it yourself. Thanks to the detailed step-by-step explanations, you will be able to put into practice everything you have learned and you will be able to quickly carry out the concepts shown yourself. And of course, at the end of the course you will have acquired knowledge, among other things, in topics such as the following:\nFor what, how, and why SIP?\nFundamentals of Asterik software and its use applied to SIP\nDifferent components of SIP and their functionalities\nSIP server and Space Domain\nSIP Register Request\nSIP Call Process\nSIP Invite Request\nPractical concepts, from simpler to more advanced and much more\nThis course is perfect for people who have heard of SIP, but don't know how to use it and need to learn from the beginning. What I mean is that it is completely suitable for beginners and people who have no idea of the subject, since everything will be explained from scratch. So don't be afraid, because as I have already told you, you are in time to learn a skill that companies seek more and more every day, and if you don't believe me, you can check it yourself by searching the Internet!\nAs If that were not enough and you are still not convinced, I will be at your disposal and answer all the questions you want in the shortest possible time. Learning SIP has never been easier. What are you waiting to join? I really want to be your instructor!",

These tests not only cover individual vulnerabilities but also train you to chain multiple flaws across layers, develop report-ready findings, and understand the secure coding implications behind each exploit.\n\n\nEach domain reflects a unique class of exploitation methodology covered in the OSWE exam:\nDomain 1: Reconnaissance & Source Code Analysis\nTopics:\nWeb Security Tools and Methodologies\nSource Code Analysis\nMaster the foundational skills required to discover vulnerabilities in both black-box and white-box environments. You'll analyze PHP, JavaScript, and .NET code to uncover logic flaws, insecure authentication mechanisms, file upload bypasses, and more — all using manual tools like Burp Suite and browser dev consoles.\nDomain 2: Injection Attacks – SQLi & Code Execution\nTopics:\nBlind SQL Injection\nRemote Code Execution\nExplore advanced manual SQL injection techniques, including time-based and content-based blind attacks, with a focus on chaining inputs into full command execution. Understand how ORM misconfigurations, input filtering, and weak error handling can lead to complete compromise.\nDomain 3: Deserialization & .NET-Specific Attacks\nTopics:\n.NET Deserialization\nRemote Code Execution (via deserialization)\nLearn to exploit insecure object serialization in .NET environments. Practice crafting ViewState exploits, leveraging BinaryFormatter abuse, and building custom gadget chains that lead to remote code execution in enterprise-grade applications.\nDomain 4: SSRF, Data Exfiltration & Internal Access\nTopics:\nAdvanced Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\nData Exfiltration\nSimulate complex SSRF scenarios that result in metadata exposure, cloud credential theft, and internal pivoting. Understand how attackers escalate SSRF to file write, internal API abuse, and ultimately remote access or exfiltration of sensitive information.\nDomain 5: Client-Side Exploitation & Session Abuse\nTopics:\nPersistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nSession Hijacking\nDevelop the ability to exploit persistent XSS vulnerabilities in modern apps and use them to hijack user sessions, bypass CSP protections, and perform privilege escalation. Examine real-world XSS chains that lead to full admin takeover.\nDomain 6: Modern JavaScript Attacks – Prototype Pollution\nTopics:\nJavaScript Prototype Pollution\n(Optional chaining with XSS or SSRF)\nDive into one of the most overlooked but powerful front-end attack classes in modern JavaScript applications. Learn how to exploit prototype pollution to escalate privileges, bypass client-side logic, or chain it with other flaws like XSS or SSRF.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll have sharpened your ability to spot and exploit complex web application vulnerabilities, strengthened your OSWE exam readiness, and practiced the core techniques needed for real-world offensive web security engagements.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Offensive Security.

Section 2 teaches network models including layered tasks in communication, the OSI reference model and its layers, TCP/IP protocol suite, and touches two protocols viz., TCP and UDP. Section 3 - Section 8 teaches the various layers and their functionalities, protocols, and operations of the OSI model such as Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application. Under the physical layer, the learners are introduced to signals, data, signal classification, transmission impairments, data rate limits, and performance. Some of the protocols that are taught here are HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP, PPP, media access control, channelization, and controlled access mechanisms together with unicast and multicast routing protocols, and intradomain & interdomain routing protocols. In-depth analysis of IP addressing and address mapping techniques are included.\n\n\nThe course completion quiz at the end will test the learner's knowledge.",

Decrypting a message just means to take the unreadable text (called ciphertext) and turn it into readable text (called plaintext).  If we have the KEY, decryption is easy.  However, if we don't have the KEY then  decryption is like solving a puzzle.  We study Caesar Ciphers (named after Julius Caesar), general Substitution Ciphers like the Pigpen Cipher or the Atbash Cipher and polyalphabetic ciphers like the Alberti and Vigenere Ciphers.  The decryption techniques we learn are Brute Force and Frequency Analysis; that is, using the frequency of letters and words in English to help decrypt messages.   We learn which decryption technique works for which types of ciphers.   We have fun doing cryptograms and students even learn how to create their own cipher using letters, numbers, symbols or even emojis.   This course will help students in their logical problem solving skills.  There are lots of practice problems with worked solutions in separate videos. All videos were created with the whiteboard animation software videoscribe.",

      "description": "It's an incredible sad fact that scams, misinformation, and disinformation is everywhere and invades every aspect of our lives. Online dating, meeting people online, work phone calls and emails, social media posts, even the news that we consume. The threat is real and has evolved to an incredible degree over the years making scamming people and convincing people of false information so incredibly easy it's frightening. Manipulated photos, AI voices that can sound just like your loved ones, fake photos on dating sights, emails that will steal your information and identities no longer requires a highly sophisticated scammer to pull off anymore. Just about anyone with a little time, a smart phone or computer and a internet connection can pull it off. How do we combat this and protect ourselves? In this course will outline a number of different scams, how they work, why they work, and how to identify it. The goal is identification and mitigation though understanding the hows and whys. We will be employing what is known as OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) to help with this goal. Don't worry, you don't need to be a professional investigator or computer expert for this course. This is designed to help walk everyone through step by step.\nAgain, this is not a full blown course on OSINT, this is designed to identify potential scams and misinformation/disinformation in order to help protect yourself and others.\nAs for me, I have been in the network and security space for over 25 years and have various security certifications, ethical hacker, OSINT investigator, online instructor, author on eForensic Magazine and Hackin9 and have several contacted courses on EC-Council and I enjoy training people to help keep them safe online. I hope to see you in the course, and always feel free to message me if you have any questions or problems (even if you haven't taken the course).",

More and more, we became more reliant on the Internet to perform daily functions for work, school and play. These daily task could include doing market research, buying a container of raw materials, groceries for the week, your lunch or even the components needed for the children's science project. We even watch more video clips through Internet stream than visit the cinema!\nDuring the Covid-19 global pandemic, many cities were on lockdown and many like you and I were stuck at home and became even more dependent on the Internet for the above functions. Therefore, cyber hygiene is necessary - not just for adults but everyone that goes online.\nCyber hygiene is NOT a technical topic that involves programming and coding, but it is a basic necessity for navigating safely in the digital internet age. Just like washing hands before eating is a part of personal hygiene, we need to have good cyber hygiene before we go on the Internet.\nThus, there is an urgent need for cyber hygiene now!\nIn this course, topics covered will include trends and legal considerations of data protection. The crux of the content will be spend providing an overview of cyber threats and how to prevent them and it is my hope that you will learn and share them with friends, colleagues and love ones to keep them safe from the dangers that lurk when being online.",

The course further teaches the various generations of mobile communications such as 1st generation: AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System); 2nd generation: D-AMPS, GSM, IS95, PCS; 3rd Generation: IMT-2000.\nSome cells come together to form a cellular network. The cell serves a certain area and has a base station that functions similarly to an 802.11 AP to assist mobile users in connecting to the network. The base station and mobile devices are connected via an air interface that supports both physical and data link layer protocols. The Mobile Switching Center, which controls mobility, and call setup and connects cells to a wide-area network, is connected to each of these base stations.\nThe base station and a specific area are both assigned a fixed amount of radio spectrum, which must now be shared. Two methods exist for sharing radio spectrum between mobile devices and base stations: Combined FDMA/TDMA and CDMA.\n\n\nThere is a course completion quiz at the end.",

It also teaches us how to use social networks while discovering and stoping the toxicity and negativity that creates depression.\nWe start by looking at how social networks are built then we move on to how they target people and create audiences for advertising. Advertising systems are used by advertisers to target and collect data on all users across multiple networks. These applications also collect data about everything we do on our smart phones and computers which makes targeting us much easier.\nTopics discussed in this course:\nHow Social Networks Are Built\nHow Social Networks Target Groups of People\nHow false news, propaganda and interest groups use social networks to spread lies\nWhat Cyber Risks and Threats are Hidden in Social Media\nHow to recognise and stop toxicity and negative interactions on social networks\nWhat mental health issues are seen by people who use social media\nWe then look at the risks and how social network apps create anxiety and depression through sustained usage via mobile apps that keep us hooked via endorphin releases (likes). This course is based on research done on the mental health issues created by social media apps and usage as well as cyberbullying and how unvetted advertisers spread fake news and propaganda. Additional research in my book The Social Media Dilemma on Amazon shows how social networks effects on mental health such as depression, suicides, attention deficits as well as negative body image.",

      "description": "Static routing is a form of routing that occurs when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than information from dynamic routing traffic. In many cases, static routes are manually configured by a network administrator by adding in entries into a routing table, though this may not always be the case. Unlike dynamic routing, static routes are fixed and do not change if the network is changed or reconfigured. Static routing and dynamic routing are not mutually exclusive. Both dynamic routing and static routing are usually used on a router to maximise routing efficiency and to provide backups in case dynamic routing information fails to be exchanged. Static routing can also be used in stub networks, or to provide a gateway of last resort.\n\n\nStatic routing may have the following uses:\nStatic routing can be used to define an exit point from a router when no other routes are available or necessary. This is called a default route.\nStatic routing can be used for small networks that require only one or two routes. This is often more efficient since a link is not being wasted by exchanging dynamic routing information.\nStatic routing is often used as a complement to dynamic routing to provide a failsafe backup if a dynamic route is unavailable.\nStatic routing is often used to help transfer routing information from one routing protocol to another (routing redistribution).",

      "description": "Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible helps take software updates from testing to deployment in a short period of time. It is a great solution for orchestrating DevOps pipelines. Whether you want to manage an entire cloud region, configure network devices, or orchestrate configuration changes across Linux or Windows machines, Ansible is up to the challenge!\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course follows a practical, informative, step-by-step approach to safeguard your system with advanced features of Ansible as well as automate your DevOps and Continuous Delivery process. You’ll begin with configuring and managing your infrastructure using Ansible Playbooks. You’ll then get a deeper understanding of Ansible design and usage, paving the way for designing and managing your own automation using Ansible. Moving further, you’ll deploy and configure your own Git repository server to serve as the basis for your DevOps pipeline.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll learn Ansible 2 and perform security automation, CI/CD for software delivery using DevOps with Ansible.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Getting Started with Core Features in Ansible 2, covers how to automate your infrastructure like a pro using Ansible 2. This course teaches you the key new features in Ansible 2 and gives an introduction to how to create Ansible playbooks and modules. You will also learn modular configuration using roles to simplify your tasks even more. You will learn to overcome security, automation, and deployment concerns by implementing Ansible playbooks. By the end of this course, you will have learned how to create and install custom modules and plugins which can be integrated to automate processes. You will speed-up software delivery from development to production by automating tasks and deliver applications much more efficiently.\nThe second course, Practical Ansible Solutions, covers real-world examples and methodologies to automate common IT tasks easily and effectively using Ansible. In this video course, we'll focus on getting things done quickly, using real-world examples and a hands-on teaching style rather than focus too much on theory and conceptual ideas once the basics are covered so you can get the job done. Core concepts—such as setting up the inventory and playbooks, ad-hoc commands and quick and dirty heavy lifting will get you up and running quickly. We'll then dive into proper playbook organization and using handlers, variables, conditionals, and logic for maximizing the efficiency of your automation workflow. We'll also dive into handling growth and multi-role playbooks and stack orchestration. As we move onward to victory, we will dive into systems lifecycle management so you can handle users, software and packages, authentication, services and application/web content with ease as well as touch on Ansible Tower/AWX. We'll end the journey with consuming and using Ansible Galaxy so you can borrow, share and collaborate with the vibrant Ansible Open Source community and the plethora of community roles and playbooks available on the internet. At the end of this course, you will attain a deeper understanding of Ansible usage and design and be empowered to create your own playbooks, properly growing and scaling them to adapt to the ever-changing needs of your IT landscape.\nThe third course, Hands-On DevOps with Ansible, covers automating your DevOps and Continuous Delivery software delivery process using Ansible 2.x. In this course, we show how a DevOps pipeline can speed up your software development. We will use DevOps practices to automate your building and testing environments to push software into production. You will use Ansible to automate your DevOps pipeline. Whether you test and deploy applications on-premise or in the cloud, and whether you build full systems or containers with Docker and Kubernetes, by the end of the course you will be able to develop and deploy reliable applications with speed using Ansible.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll learn Ansible 2 and perform security automation, CI/CD for software delivery using DevOps with Ansible.\nAbout the Authors\nPrateek Jain is an enthusiastic DevOps Engineer with the necessary drive and determination to work with organizations to build large platforms, with a focus on end-to-­end automation, the cloud, continuous delivery, and infrastructure automation.

      "description": "Hello, My course, \"Ethical Hacking:  Design an Info Stealer using Python 3\" has just been released here in 2024.  The way this course works is as follows:\nI will start at ground zero and show you how to design and build a fully functional \"Info Stealer\" that can be used on your own computer for educational purposes, or you can use it on remote computers at work, or if you have customers that you are conducting a Red Team exercise for, it can be used there as well.\nOnce we are finished building the tool together, it will perform three functions:\n1)  Keylogging - All keystrokes will be written to local disk, to a UNC path, or to a share.\n2)  Screenshots - Screenshots can occur on a time interval that you configure inside the code.  They write to local disk, a UNC path, or to a share.\n3)  Clipboard - This works the same way the screenshots do, with a collection occuring on a set time interval and the results get written out to a file locally , or to a UNC path, or to a share.\nI will explain all the code, so beginners shouldn't worry that much, yet intermediate coders may pick up a few things as well, and besides, the final product is going to be really cool.\nI will also teach you how to turn your Python code into a single executable file, so that the Python code and all of its dependencies are included.  Then when it comes time to run the Python on a target computer, Python doesn't need to be present on that system, and our code will run regardless.\nLastly, I will show you some Windows commands that are typically enabled or available on a corporate or government network that uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD).  You may be able to use these commands to run your Python code remotely on a target computer if you are part of the same domain and you have \"pwned\" the proper credentials.",

Many people claim that this attack is not exploitable in real-world applications, but they are wrong.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn how a race condition attack works. You’ll see how the attacker, who has $1000 in his bank account, can transfer more than $1000 from his bank account as a result of a race condition attack. You’ll also see how the attacker can reuse a one-time discount code many times as a result of a race condition attack. These attacks will be presented step by step in the demos so that you can see how race condition exploitation works in practice. What’s more - you'll learn how to check if your web applications are vulnerable to race condition attacks and you’ll also learn how to prevent these attacks from happening.\n\nLast but not least – I’ll discuss case studies of award-winning race condition attacks. You’ll see that some of the greatest companies in the world (e.g. Facebook, Starbucks, and HackerOne) were vulnerable to these attacks and fortunately for these companies these bugs were detected and reported by ethical hackers. I hope this sounds good to you and I can’t wait to see you in the class.",

Whether you're preparing for entry-level roles or aiming to solidify your expertise for advanced positions, this course arms you with over 450 carefully crafted conceptual and scenario-based questions. Each question comes with detailed explanations, enabling you to understand the “why” behind the correct answers—not just memorize them.\nYou’ll begin with a foundational understanding of Networking Fundamentals, such as the OSI and TCP/IP models, IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes, and how basic components like switches, routers, and cabling interconnect devices across layers.\nThen, move into Switching & VLANs, where you'll learn the logic behind MAC address tables, VLAN configurations, STP/RSTP protocols, and EtherChannel implementations—knowledge that’s crucial for maintaining stable LAN environments.\nThe Routing Technologies section dives deep into static and dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP), as well as IPv6 routing concepts. Here, you'll develop the critical decision-making skills interviewers expect regarding route selection and protocol behaviors.\nIn IP Services & Addressing, we break down how core services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT operate, and how ACLs shape access control in real-world deployments.\nSecurity is paramount, so we focus on Network Security Basics—including VPN setups, firewall zone logic, and understanding AAA frameworks. You’ll also gain insight into common attack vectors and how to mitigate them.\nGiven the rise of mobility, we cover Wireless Networking thoroughly, including 802.11 standards, channel planning, security protocols like WPA3, and site surveys.\nTo future-proof your skills, we introduce Network Automation & Scripting, where you'll work with Python libraries (Netmiko, NAPALM), REST APIs, Ansible, and concepts like Infrastructure as Code and SDN.\nUnderstanding network state is critical, so the Network Monitoring & Management module explores SNMP, Syslog, NetFlow, and tools like Wireshark, SolarWinds, and PRTG to help you troubleshoot and monitor performance.\nSince cloud networking is now a standard, the Cloud & Hybrid Networking section introduces AWS VPCs, Azure VNets, NAT/Internet gateways, SD-WAN, and more to help bridge your understanding between on-prem and cloud environments.\nFinally, in Troubleshooting & Practical Scenarios, you'll apply your skills using a layer-by-layer troubleshooting approach.

      "description": "Online Safety: Cybersecurity, Health & Scam Prevention is your practical, beginner-friendly roadmap to living, working, and banking online with confidence. The risks are real: in 2024, people reported $12.5B in consumer fraud losses (up 25% year-over-year), with text-message scams alone costing $470M. The FBI logged 859,532 internet-crime complaints and $16.6B in reported losses, while the human element—phishing, social engineering, missteps—was present in ~68% of breaches. Global damage from cybercrime is projected to reach $10.5T annually by 2025.\n\n\nThis course turns those headlines into action. You’ll start by locking down devices and accounts with strong passwords and passphrases, two-factor authentication (2FA), screen locks, updates, and safe use of shared devices. We demystify phishing, smishing, and social engineering so you can practice real-world scam prevention—spotting red flags, responding decisively, and reporting incidents. You’ll master safer browsing habits—recognising trustworthy sites, handling cookie and permission prompts—and you’ll take control of data privacy on social platforms. Finally, you’ll build reliable backups and learn secure wipe techniques to prevent data loss or unauthorised access.\n\n\nNext, manage your health online—confidently and securely. Using universal, vendor-neutral steps, you’ll register for patient/clinic portals, book appointments, request prescription refills, and access online health records. You’ll learn how to evaluate health information sources and find nearby services, all while protecting personal data. Every workflow is broken into clear actions with checklists and quick wins so you can complete essential tasks independently.\n\n\nThen you’ll level up your money skills. Set up online banking and mobile banking safely, make payments and transfers, and reduce exposure to banking fraud using verification habits that actually work. We simplify bank accounts, help you create a workable budget, and point you to trusted money-guidance resources. If you’re applying for government benefits online, you’ll learn how to prepare documents, submit applications, track status, and keep sensitive information secure from end to end.\n\n\nBy the end, you will be able to:\n— Implement everyday Online Safety and cybersecurity habits with 2FA, updates, and safe device sharing.\n— Identify and handle online scams (phishing, smishing, social engineering) and recover safely.\n— Protect personal data with backups, secure erase, and smarter privacy settings.\n— Navigate the web confidently—trust signals, permissions, and friction-free safe browsing.\n— Use health portals for bookings, refills, records access, and credible health information checks.\n— Use online/mobile banking, make secure payments, and apply budgeting skills to daily life.\n— Complete benefits applications securely on government/agency portals.\n\n\nIf you’re a digital beginner, parent/career, student, jobseeker, care/support worker, ESOL learner, or sole trader, this hands-on program gives you the essential Online Safety, scam prevention, health portal, and online banking skills to thrive. No jargon. No fluff. Just clear steps, bite-size lessons, downloadable checklists—and results you can use immediately.",

Try sample questions today and elevate your CCSP preparation!\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nYour organization operates a global e-commerce platform. Traffic spikes significantly during holiday seasons and promotional campaigns, but otherwise remains relatively stable. As the Cloud Security Architect, you are tasked with designing a solution that allows the application to handle sudden increases in traffic without performance degradation while optimizing costs during off-peak periods. Which of the following cloud design principles and solutions would you recommend?\n\n\nA. Implement a manual server scaling process to increase or decrease the number of virtual machines based on predicted traffic patterns.\nB. Design an auto-scaling group with pre-defined rules to automatically add or remove compute resources based on CPU utilization and request load.\nC. Deploy a multi-cloud strategy using two separate cloud providers to manually distribute workloads during peak times.\nD. Use reserved instances across all peak times for consistent capacity, regardless of traffic variations.\n\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B follows the scalability design principle by using an auto-scaling mechanism, which dynamically allocates compute resources in response to demand. This ensures the system can handle traffic surges (horizontal scaling) during peak periods and scale down to reduce costs during off-peak times.\nOption A introduces operational complexity and delay, as manual intervention limits agility.\nOption C adds redundancy but does not address dynamic scaling efficiently, as it relies on manual workload distribution.\nOption D wastes resources and costs during off-peak times since reserved instances are always billed, regardless of utilization.\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nYour organization offers a cloud-based service with a public API that accepts user input to perform operations like data retrieval and updates. Recently, there have been attempts to exploit the API by injecting scripts and malformed data. As a Cloud Security Architect, which strategy ensures robust input validation to prevent such exploits?\n\n\nA. Enforce HTTPS communication for all API calls to secure data in transit.\nB. Implement schema validation for API requests, combined with allowlists for acceptable parameter values.\nC. Enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and block malicious traffic.\nD. Use rate limiting to restrict the number of API calls a user can make within a specific timeframe.\n\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Option B provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring robust input validation. Schema validation checks that incoming requests adhere to a predefined structure, ensuring that only expected and valid data is processed. Coupling this with allowlists further restricts inputs to acceptable values, effectively mitigating risks like script injection and malformed data.\nOption A secures data in transit but does not prevent malicious inputs from reaching the application.\nOption C adds a layer of defense but does not replace the need for strong input validation.\nOption D mitigates abuse but is unrelated to input validation or preventing injection attacks.\n\n\nTake the Next Step Toward CCSP Certification Success!\nEnroll in the CCSP Exam Practice & Insights course on Udemy and start your journey toward becoming a Certified Cloud Security Professional. This comprehensive course includes 250+ expertly designed practice questions to test and enhance your cloud security knowledge.\nThorough Preparation to Build Confidence\nGain a deep understanding of cloud security principles, architecture, and risk management\nStrengthen your problem-solving skills with realistic, exam-style practice tests\nBoost your confidence and readiness for the CCSP certification exam\nWishing You Success on Your Certification Journey!\nWe value your feedback!

Everyone needs a MitM proxy if they are investigating application traffic and while there are many to pick from, ZAP has distinct advantages over all of them.\nCompared to burp suite pro, OWASP ZAP includes the same features but is free.\nCompared to Charles proxy, ZAP includes more interactivity.\nZAP has context-dependent UI screens, meaning they only show you what is relevant at that time to avoid screen clutter.\nZAP works with a server/database system, allowing you to easily make and restore snapshots.\nWe can keep on going on forever about it's clear this is an essential tool for any hacker who takes themselves even the least bit serious. While it may be a bit harder to learn since everyone is used to burp suite, this tutorial aims to guide you through the basics in video format. You can follow along with the instructor and even perform the automated scans on labs that are created by the author.\nWhoAmI?\nMy name is Wesley Thijs and I've been an instructor for about 3 years now. Before this, I was a QA engineer and since recently also a full-time pentester in my own company. I love seeing people floorish and rise up to the challenges that face us as hackers. Of course, we all know information is free on the internet anywhere we look but it's also this overwhelming feeling of information that led me to start creating courses that follow an easy to follow along guide with labs you can try all this hacking violence on.",

This is in contrast to a regular or \"bind\" shell, where the compromised system actively listens for incoming connections.\nBotnets are commonly used for various malicious activities, including:\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: The botmaster can command the bots to flood a target website or online service with traffic, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.\nSpam Distribution: Botnets can be used to send out massive volumes of spam emails, promoting scams, phishing attacks, or spreading malware.\nCredential Theft: Bots may be used to collect usernames and passwords through various means, such as keylogging or phishing, providing attackers with unauthorized access to accounts.\nCryptojacking: Botnets can be used to secretly mine cryptocurrencies by harnessing the computing power of the compromised devices.\nInformation Theft: Botnets may be used to gather sensitive information, such as personal and financial data, for identity theft or other malicious purposes.\nPropagation of Malware: Botnets can be used to distribute and install additional malware on the compromised devices, creating a broader and more resilient network for the attacker.\nReverse shells are a common technique used in various cybersecurity scenarios, including penetration testing and ethical hacking, where security professionals assess the vulnerabilities of a system to help improve its defenses. However, reverse shells are also a common component of malicious activities, such as remote exploitation, data theft, and unauthorized system access.\nWe will use rust to create a reverse shell server and client.",

Moore for use as a Perl-based portable network tool, with assistance from core developer Matt Miller. It was fully converted to Ruby by 2007, and the license was acquired by Rapid7 in 2009, where it remains as part of the Boston-based company’s repertoire of IDS signature development and targeted remote exploit, fuzzing, anti-forensic, and evasion tools.",
