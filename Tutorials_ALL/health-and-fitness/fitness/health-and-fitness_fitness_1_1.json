I have been teaching boot camps for many years. I would like to share some of the lessons I have learned with anybody who would like to take a shot at creating their own boot camp.\nMany people are turning to fitness experts to help them find their way to a healthier lifestyle. The internet is a vast resource, but there are positives and negatives to so much information. New instructors can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of articles and conflicting opinions. You aren’t sure what to believe or what to accept. I will use this course to help you navigate through all that extra stuff and get you on your way in a one stop shopping trip.\nIn this course I will lay out the groundwork for creating a fun and rewarding boot camp using proven methods and shortcuts I have developed in the years that I have been teaching.\n\nI like to have fun in both my gym classes and my instructional classes. I hope you join me for a look into how to create the ultimate boot camp. See you at the gym!",

There are so many benefits one receives from the burpee:\nCardio\nFat-loss\nStrength\nFlexibility\nSpeed\nMental toughness\nCoordination\nAnd so much more.\n\n\nThis course will teach anyone, literally anyone, from being sedentary to being able to perform the most basic form of the burpee and how to progress through safe steps. If you want to use the burpee in your training yourself or want to learn how to teach others, this course is for you. If you want to learn more advanced and plenty of burpee variations, then this course is for you.\n\n\nLike with any exercise, but especially the burpee, when not performed correctly it can be dangerous and damaging to the lower back, knees, etc. In this online course, I will guide you step-by-step in building up your knowledge, strength, and ability to perform the burpee.\nSome might look at the burpee and go \"that's easy\" but there is a difference between just having a go at an exercise or receiving detailed instructions from someone with over two decades of experience and having taught thousands of people across the world.\nThe first-hand experience, teaching others, and seeing others in action has taught me how to adjust, teach, build-up, and keep the burpee safe.",

      "description": "15 Minute Hell: The Ultimate Bodyweight Workout For Warriors\n\nYears ago, many of Japan's top Judo players were also educators (After all, Judo itself was founded by a doctor of education in the late 1800's). Scores of these teacher-athletes were sent all over the world to spread the study of the popular Japanese sport.\nThrough their hard work Judo has become a \"staple\" in many Asian and European physical education classes, as well as become the 3rd most popular contact sport in the world (behind soccer and hockey).\nHere in the United States however...not so much.\nAlthough we Americans love wrestling, boxing, and Ultimate Fighting; Judo just never caught on.\nThe proud Japanese considered this lack of interest a \"slap in the face\" to their ego, and they decided to do something about it.\nThe top Judo teachers originally sent to the United States were \"recalled\" to attend a top level, strictly \"hush-hush\" symposium in Japan... Including my coach.\nThe Japanese government also consented (for the first time ever) to reveal to a panel of hand picked \"American apprentices\" the details of an incredible new training system that had been developed over the last ten years.\nAnd as an educator, coach, and former competitive player, I had received an official invitation to attend.\nEntering the super-secret workout labs of the Japanese Olympic Judo Team (the same guys who beat the piss out of everyone else in the world every 4 years) it was revealed to those of us in attendance, that top Japanese scientists, psychologists, coaches, and elite athletes had been working to determine a solution for the lack of American involvement in their national sport.\nWhy all the \"hub-bub\" over American involvement? Why else...MONEY!!\nHard statistics don't lie...Whenever the American public embrace something foreign, whether a product, service, sport, etc. the providing country's tourism, media, and manufacturing revenue shoots up like a rocket.\nOn a larger scale, everyone knows that whatever America does, the world follows suit...so we're talking about a virtually untapped market worth Millions and MILLIONS of dollars per year to the Japanese if they could pull it off.\nThe Japanese were convinced that the American lack of interest in Judo was based solely on the fact that learning even the basics of Judo are time consuming and physically taxing. And free time and physical fitness are two things Americans are in short supply of.\nTherefore the Japanese believed, if they could lure Americans into official Judo schools with a patented, time-efficient, super-results bodyweight workout they would \"de-throne\" the Billion dollar American health club and gym industry as the \"King\" fitness solution and they would soon be rollin' in truckloads of Yen.\nThe handful of us in attendance actually were invited along with Japanese officials to serve as witnesses for the \"unveiling\" of this new program.\nAnd when I learned these Japanese secrets, my jaw dropped.\nSimply put, the Japanese trainers had thrown out practically everything we and the Europeans believe in when it came to how the body builds strength, power, and endurance at a rapid rate - and they'd developed and perfected a much higher-level training approach that produced results myself, my colleagues, and especially the Japanese officials had a hard time believing were possible.\nThe experimental exercise program consisted of no weights, no machines, no fancy equipment.\nUsing animals in the wild as evidence, the program's creators showed how animals are stronger, faster and more flexible than humans - yet, they don't lug a machine or barbell around when they train. They got their abilities by working with nothing more than their own bodyweight when they hunt or play.\nNow, we all know that bodyweight exercises are nothing new. In fact, if you take a look at military history, they've been doing calisthenics to prepare for battle since the dawn of civilization.\nWhat was different with the Japanese program was that its development team had conducted literally thousands upon thousands of experiments over the last few years to determine what bodyweight exercises worked best and what didn't.\nAnd they had stumbled onto something absolutely amazing....\nThey discovered that if certain bodyweight exercises were performed in a very specific sequence all within a certain time \"window\"...almost superhuman improvements in strength, endurance, and fat loss are in a matter of only a few days! DAYS!!!\nAnd when I say dramatic, I mean that their program would double the rate of your muscle development and QUADRUPLE the rate of body-fat loss (actual statistics from the Japanese training facility) in as little as 6 to 8 days!\nAfter returning home I put the program to the test. Learning the ins and outs of the program as well as using the experimental program for my own conditioning, I began to see instantaneous results.\nAnd my life changed almost immediately...\nAt the end of one week, I began to feel physically \"better\". I could breathe deeply, walk at a more rapid pace, and the stiffness in my neck and shoulders was gone.\nBut the best part? I lost an incredible 11 pounds! And that was only ONE WEEK!\nDuring week two I began to sleep like a log; eight hours of deep sleep was no longer a goal it became automatic. I would wake up refreshed and ready to \"rumble\" every morning. (And still do!)\nWithin three weeks I had packed what can only be called functional muscle onto my legs, chest and back that I've never had before. No \"bulk\" to really speak of, just lean muscle making me super flexible while getting incredibly stronger.\nBy week four my endurance had tripled and my athletic skills started to improve by leaps and bounds. And no wonder...when I stepped on the scale I was shocked to see that I had already dropped 30 pounds!\nAt the end of week five I was given a body-fat analysis. The results? Well, it seemed that in only those five weeks time I had burned off enough excess body fat to the point where I could eat more than I normally did and still continue to lose weight!\nIn week six I noticed something truly amazing...the years of pain I had sustained from countless injuries both in the gym and on the Judo mat. No more shoulder pain from benching, back pain from dead lifts, or neck pain from being tossed on my head during practice.\nMy favorite week was week seven. That week I seemingly gained explosive strength, energy, and a remarkable increase in athletic speed out of thin air. I felt pliable and springy, like a tiger.\nFinally, by the eighth and last week I was in such incredible physical shape that I once again became a holy terror on the Judo mat. And even more important...I looked damn good!\nAll and all, I lost 70 plus pounds, plunged my body fat to below 10%, and brought my resting heart rate to around 54 beats per minute.\nAt the drop of a hat I could blast out 100 pushups, 20 pull-ups, and then run a mile all without getting winded or out of breath....at 185 lbs.\nBut Here's The Best Part...\nThe entire bodyweight workout, although intense, only took 15 minutes!\nI know it sounds absolutely crazy, and trust me...I also thought they were absolutely bonkers when it was laid out on the table, but you just can't argue with results. And as you saw in my own personal experience, those 15 minutes is all you need to whip yourself into incredible shape.\nThese exercises work much better than weights, and a zillion times better than cardiovascular equipment. Although the routine is intense, the exercises are fun, quick, and energizing.\nAnd since you are using your own bodyweight, you never have to worry about injury, overtraining, or best of all...ever needing to waste another dollar or wait on line for machines at a gym.\nThat eighth week, when I showed up back at my coach's Judo school to resume training, I received some startling news.\nAlthough my coach slapped me on the back, and congratulated me on my personal success using the program, he informed that the American public would never see it implemented.\nIt turns out that only a week after we returned from Japan, he had received an official phone call from the Japanese training center.\nSo impressed were the Japanese officials who attended the demonstration that they completely changed their minds about the \"American Judo problem\" and decided to only reveal the program to their own professional and Olympic athletes.\nIn typical Japanese snobbery, they felt that the program was too good...Too Powerful... to share with the rest of the world.\n(And four years later, at the Athens 2004 Olympics, their incredibly dominating Gold medal performance in both men's and women's' Judo, Wrestling, Swimming, and (most surprisingly) the Hammer Throw...proved it.)\nAll the Japanese affiliated Judo schools that attended were threatened with everything from lawsuits to being thrown out of the Judo federation and their status revoked if they taught the program to their American students. (Or for that matter, any other nationality besides Japanese citizens as well)\nOh well, I thought. Sucks for Judo...BUT GREAT FOR ME!!!\nI had no ties, no affiliation, and most importantly, no loyalty to the Japanese government.\nIf I wanted to teach my fellow Americans these training secrets that had been perfected in the lab and proven in competition, there was not a damn thing they could do to stop me....\nIf you are serious about changing your body...If you want enormous strength, tightly defined muscles, a massive chest, slender waist, powerful arms and legs, and the attention and benefits of being a walking, living comic book superhero, I can make it happen faster and easier than you ever imagined possible. But not necessarily without hard work.\nRemember, the approach I will reveal to you requires only 15 minutes each day, but it does require you to use that time far differently than you could ever imagine.\nI can honestly give my word that you will see undeniable increases in your muscle size, strength and appearance -- a total body change --within the first 21 days of applying the 15 Minute Hell program. I did it...and so can you.\nAnd I also promise you this: If you'll only invest those 15 minutes each day following the principles of this incredible training system --there will be no stopping you.",

      "description": "If you're looking to build strong and good looking shoulders with kettlebells then this kettlebell training course is for you. I will cover several variations of the kettlebells press, mobility exercises, and assistance exercises to increase your pressing strength. I will spend a considerable amount of time explaining the kettlebell exercise and then I will also include lots of content on how to workout with the kettlebell press.\nI cover:\nSafety\nProgression\nWarming up\nHow to clean for pressing\nHow to hold and rack the kettlebell\n50+ kettlebell press variations\n\n\nThis is not a 'do this and then you end up here' course, in this course, I will explain why, how, when, and everything that happens in between. I cover all the important things that will help you to build strong and good looking shoulders with the kettlebell. You get over a decade of experience in this course.\n\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this is a high production video project, because it's not, not when it comes to money. But it is when it comes to effort and content. The video is shot during one of my 3-day mountain hikes in the Sierra Nevada's dragging the kettlebell along. There will be sounds of the water flowing wildly next to where I'm filming and there will be some wind in the microphone too. It's an adventure wrapped in a kettlebell course.\nNote: if it's more important to have a high production video with crystal clear audio that is shot in a crisp looking studio, then this course is not it. But if you're after quality, passion, and original content that is filmed in nature and will help you understand how to use the kettlebell to build strong, safe, and mobile shoulders, then come and join me.\n\n\nHope to see you soon.\nTaco Fleur from Cavemantraining\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation. These courses are not the same as the ones offered on our website. The courses on our website include coaching, assessments, exams, additional books (in some cases), and certification, all aimed at trainers or kettlebell enthusiasts that are serious about their education.",

      "description": "This course is really two courses in one - plus some routines and tips 'n' tricks.\nCourse 1:\nFrom frail to fit in 50 lectures\nThis course goes through the various factors that are likely to lead to frailty as you age and then into detail as to how to avoid becoming frail. The course looks at the evidence-based reasons for frailty and the evidence-based remedies. Many studies are references but there are also various fitness routines included.\nCourse 2\nFrom fat to fit at 50!\nThis second course is a prolonged interview with Chris Zaremba, author of the book 'Fat to Fit at Fifty'. Chris was very overweight. He not only lost weight but became a world champion in Fitness Modelling and Muscle Modelling. (Note: For his age range!)\nThrough the interview - and with further research - we end up with a blue print for others to follow that will enable them too to lose weight, become super-healthy and enjoy life.\nAs Chris says: \"At 50, I was obese, pre-diabetic and with high blood lipids (bad cholesterol), hypertension and pretty much no aerobic capacity. Today, my blood pressure and all other measurements are (according to the doc) typical for a healthy 30-35 year old.\"\nExtras\nThere is an extra section. 30 days of routines and tips 'n' tricks to help you in your healthy ageing journey.\nWho is this course for?\nEveryone - whatever your age. All of us are getting older. Therefore all of us - if we do not pay attention to how we live - risk becoming frail. Maybe not for some years but why wait to take steps to prevent frailty?\nIf not frail, there is every chance that instead you'll become obese. Why not learn from someone who has 'been there' and since has his own TV channel, a range of awards, and is much in demand for training internationally?\nTwo Instructors\nChris S : Fitness qualification to run exercise classes for the elderly; recovered from stroke through an emphasis on fitness; experienced Udemy Instructor. (Frail to fit.)\nChris Z : Numerous fitness qualifications; Personal Trainer; experienced fitness competition-winner. (Fat to fit)\n\n\nREMEMBER: By its very nature, this course is in a constant state of update. Taking the 30-days of routines for example: these are being created in June i.e. right now so follow at one per day, do not expect to see all at once.\nThis is a course to be taken slowly with huge thought and consideration.",

For the past 10 years, his focus as a physiotherapist has been mainly on the treatment and prevention of running injuries. He also coaches and advises runners of every level.\nCommon mistakes are often made because people don’t understand the rules of running...just like there are rules to driving your car to prevent engine problems or crashes, there are rules to running...that is if you want to prevent engine problems and crashes! Not following these rules is the primary reason for injuries and limitations on improvement.\nIn this course, Christoff introduces you to these running rules and shares the most important things he has learnt over the years, both as a runner himself and as a practising physiotherapist. These lessons, will not only help you improve as a runner, but also allow you to find greater joy in your running.\n\"The person from whom you seek help must understand the importance of your running to you. It's patently ridiculous to accept advice from someone who is antagonistic or indifferent to your running in the first place\".\n-- Prof. Tim Noakes\nChristoff's personal message to you:\n\"Running is special. It is just\nyou\n, a pair of running shoes and the time or distance you are trying to beat.\nMost other sports include a ball, a bike or whatever else you fancy. The “ problem” here is that with running, you are providing the forces, the suspension and the stability... and more than 80% of those that regularly run will get injured.\nThat is what statistics tell us.\nSo what if there was a way to lower your risk of injury and still make improvements?\nWell there is!\nThere are rules or guidelines that can help you do both, but unfortunately many, if not most runners don’t know the rules, or simply don’t follow them.\nThis course is an attempt at helping every runner to understand the rules of their engine and mechanics. It also serves to evaluate your current state and to evaluate yourself on a regular basis in the process of making long term improvement.\nThere is a lot of information out there on running and exercise, but much of it is very opinionated and does not really help us to see the big picture.\nMost of what I present in this course is based on sound principles and evidence, and a bit of trial and error.\nSo maybe the frustration of injury or struggling to make improvements have made you forget why running is special? Maybe you just need some perspective or just some information to guide you in the right direction.\nLet me help you to understand, evaluate and improve your running.\"\nThis course aims to help you understand, evaluate and improve your running on both a systemic and mechanical level, and it is around these three pillars which the course is structured:\nSystemic: Refers to the physiology of your running and developing your runners engine\nMechanical: Refers to the biomechanics of your running and assessing your levers and connective tissue development\n1. Understand your running at a systemic level\nStudents are introduced to Aerobic and Anaerobic training and how differences between these two forms of training affect you at four different levels: Metabolic, Stress, Musculoskeletal and Skill/Technique.\n2. Understand your running at a mechanical level\nYou learn the mechanics behind what should, ideally, be happening at each of your joints as you run.\n3. Evaluate your running at a systemic level\nStudents are taught how to evaluate their running using Christoff's 3 point self-evaluating tool.\n4. Evaluate your running at a mechanical level\nYou are taught how to evaluate your running posture and technique.\n5. Improve your running at a systemic level\nStudents are shown how they can improve on previous training mistakes .\n6. Improve your running at a mechanical level\nYou are taught how to overcome the bio-mechanical limitations that have prevented you from improving in the past.\nSo. are you ready to get cruising with Christoff?

This course content is especially for trainers who are new to the profession, or individuals with at least some exercise background who want to train in a healthy way.\n\n\nWhat Will Functional Fitness Programs Give You?\n\n\nFunctional fitness programs are programs that aim to improve performance with training content that uses holistic movements to improve the body's movement mechanics. Exercises are chosen as indicated by functional anatomy and the exercises used in this course are accepted by the training community and used at all levels.\n\n\n'There are no unnecessary exercises like squatting on a Pilates ball.'\n\n\nWithin these programs, besides the use of various skills exercises to move better, training planning is made for power development and strength development. Thus, the athlete can increase his/her mobility, contribute to his/her speed, increase the force produced per unit time and increase muscle development.\n\n\nHow Does It Contribute to Physical Appearance?\n\n\nMuscle growth is achieved when adequate calorie intake and nutrition are provided for muscle growth.\nIt gives the body a leaner, tighter and athletic appearance in a non-developmental nutritional approach.\nFor women, if calories are consumed to keep the weight in balance, the body becomes tighter and leaner, the waist becomes thinner, the appearance becomes balanced and impressive.\nIf weight loss-oriented nutrition is applied, weight is lost and physical appearance becomes more impressive.\n\n\nWhat did I teach In The Course?\n\n\nDuring the classes, I explained as much necessary as to be needed. I used an understandable and plain language without going into the depth of knowledge the books. With this perspective, I have explained the following topics;\n\n\nMobility, activation, preparation for movement, movement skills exercises,\nMini plyometric exercises and explosive strength exercises,\nFunctional strength exercises for the lower body and upper body,\nFunctional core workouts,\nStretching exercises,\nSample training programs,\nExplanations of other topics that will support the above items and make them easier to understand.\n\n\nRequired Equipment for Sample Programs\n\n\nAs I explained in the welcome video of the course, this course is built on practicing with minimal equipment, but it is 100% compatible with gym. I gave exercise recommendations for gym users too.\nIn order to implement the sample programs and exercises, at least 1 kettlebell (with sufficient weight), corsstraining ring (gymnastic ring or trx or a suspension belt that you can pull yourself) is used. You can see these equipment in the courses that are open to preview.\nThe reason why it is designed for minimal equipment is that training can be applied in places such as parks, gardens or home environments.\n\n\nSee you in classes.\n\n\nUmut Varol\nPersonal Trainer & Coach",

This course can do it for you.\n\n\nThis course is perfect for beginners, intermediate, and advanced lifters, as well as personal trainers who want to take their training to the next level.\n\n\nUnderstanding how to design a program, using evidence-based principles, is crucial for longterm success, by allowing for more flexibility as well as proactiveness in your training.\n\n\nBy providing you with the tools and knowledge necessary to create effective and individualized programs, I believe that you can achieve your goals and reach your full potential!\n\n\nHOW CAN THIS COURSE HELP YOU?\n\n\n1. By Solving the Challenge of Navigating Weight Training Information:\nIf you're new to the world of weight training, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the abundance of information available, particularly on social media platforms. With so many different opinions and methods being shared, it can be challenging to discern which approaches are truly effective and applicable to your own goals and needs.\n\n\n2. By Highlighting Evidence-Based Principles:\nMy goal for creating this course is to educate interested individuals, like yourself, in a simple and straightforward manner, providing you with information that is grounded in research-based studies and industry guidelines. By using evidence-based principles, I can help you develop a comprehensive understanding of how to design a program that is effective and efficient for your specific goals. I believe that understanding how to design a program is crucial for long-term success, as it allows you to tailor your training to your individual needs and preferences, increasing the likelihood of adherence and sustained progress.\n\n\n3. By Tailoring Training Programs to Individual Needs:\nThe harsh reality is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to weight training, the results you achieve will be highly dependent on your individual factors. My course will provide you with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to create a program that is personalized to your unique situation, whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced lifter, or a personal trainer looking to expand your knowledge base.\n\n\n4. By Empowering You to Make Informed Decisions:\nBeing independent in creating your own, science-based, individualized, training program, will give you a lot of power and control over your goals and what you will do to achieve them. So let’s start this journey and learn how to create the perfect program!\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU USE THE INFORMATION LEARNED FROM THIS COURSE?\n\n\nThe knowledge and skills gained from this course can be practically applied in various ways.\n\n\nAs a beginner, you can start by using the information to design a program that is suitable for your goals and fitness level. By following the principles taught in the course, you can create a program that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences. This will help you to achieve your goals more effectively and efficiently while reducing the risk of injury.\n\n\nAs you gain more experience, you can use the information learned to design programs for others. If you're a personal trainer or coach, you can use the knowledge and skills gained from this course to create programs for your clients that are effective, safe, and tailored to their unique needs and goals. By using evidence-based principles, you can ensure that your programs are based on sound scientific principles and are likely to produce positive results for your clients.\n\n\nIn addition to designing programs, the knowledge gained from this course can also be applied to make modifications and adjustments to existing programs. As you become more experienced in program design, you may encounter situations where the program you designed for yourself or your clients needs to be modified. By applying the principles taught in this course, you can make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the program continues to meet the individual's needs and goals.\n\n\nFinally, the knowledge gained from this course can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs. By understanding the principles of program design and how to implement them effectively, you can evaluate the success of your training program and make informed decisions about how to modify it to achieve better results.\n\nThe main points that will be discussed in this course are:\n1. Periodization\n2. Training variables\n3. Effort\n4. Load/Reps\n5. Volume\n6. Frequency\n7. Rest\n8. Exercise selection\n9. Exercise variation\n10. Range of motion\n11.  Exercise order\n12. Bracing and stability\n13. How to progress?\n14. What is a deload?\n15.

Too many to list, but here are a few that are very important:\nYou get stronger\nYour upper body gets bigger and more defined - sort of like the upper bodies of the ancient Greek and Roman warriors\nYou develop the upper body muscles that will help you tremendously in other major exercises, like shoulder and bench presses\nI'm talking from experience - I know how instrumental the pull up exercise was in my own physical development and my athletic career..\nHi, my name is Ivan Nikolov and I teach this Beginners Pull Up Tutorial course.\nI've spent over 23 years doing hard gym training and competing in natural bodybuilding competitions. And, I have to be honest - no other exercise has helped me so much to develop my upper body as it has the pull up - so much that for the last few years the pull up is literally my main exercise.\nHere are the details:\nThese days I do more than 200 pull ups each week. You can do the math if you want, but that amounts to over 20 thousand pull ups in the last two years alone. At this point I feel like I can pull up better than I can walk... figuratively speaking!\nI just recently completed a full video catalog of 35 variations of the pull up exercise all that are known to me - starting from the easiest - the simple pull up to the most difficult variations, including the one-arm pull up.\nSo, I know a thing or two about pull ups... and I teach you everything I know in this Beginners Pull Up Tutorial course!\nLet me tell you a little bit about this course: In this video course I don't waste any time at all - I get you working fairly quickly.

We are going to start with\nChest and tri chest focused workout,\nBack and biceps back focused workout,\nShoulders and legs shoulders focused workout.\nthen we will take one day Rest and we get back\nTriceps and chest triceps focused workout.\nBiceps and back biceps focused workout.\nLegs and shoulders legs focused workout.\nThen we are going to take another day Rest.\nStick to this program for at least 8 weeks and you will see great results.\nFree weights verses machines, every option have it's benefits, one of the crucial benefits of using machine is Safety:\nSafety:\nWhen used properly, free-weight equipment like barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells and medicine balls can be extremely effective. However, if an individual lacks a base level of strength or basic movement skills, using this equipment could increase the risk of injury. Even if an individual is strong, the ego is sometimes stronger, causing him to lift a weight that is heavier than his existing level of strength. While overloading a barbell for a squat or bench press could cause serious injury, machines allow a user to lift with maximal loads with a minimal risk of injury from falling weights.\nWish you all the best have a nice day.",

The Greeks themselves did not have fancy machines, yet they carried better bodies then than most men do today.\nThey were essentially calisthenics athletes, masters of their own body weight. You can train in the same way without leaving the house.\nSome men will tell you that they train for themselves and not for the attention or validation of the opposite sex, but I see us for what we are..\n..base creatures. Everything man does is to further spread his seed and there's nothing wrong with that. Having an amazing body significantly increases your attractiveness and whether people admit it or not attractive people live better lives. Become one yourself.\nYour physique, the one you build here, cannot be taken from you. The respect of men and glares of women is simply a few weeks of training away.",

      "description": "Allow me to teach you some of the best and functional movements patterns to get up from the ground and enjoy the benefits of increased:\nStrength\nFlexibility\nMobility\nStability\nEndurance\nAnd so much more with a strong focus on proper form to avoid injury for those at home, in the gym, and even trainers.\nIn this course I will break down some of the popular exercises like the Turkish Get-Up, starting with bodyweight and drilling each part of the movement, slowly building up to the full movement, and then add weight.\nTurkish Get-Up Lunge Style\nTurkish Get-Up Squat Style\nShin Box Get-Up\nGladiator Get-Up\nSquat Get-Up\nHindu Get-Up\nAnd more\nYou will be able to learn these movements and program them for strength, muscular endurance, stability, and so much more.\nThe most detailed and longest explanation in this course is for the Turkish Get-up as that is the most popular get-up variation and it also lays some of the foundations for the variations of the get-up. I also provide a summary of the TGU so that people who do have some experience with the TGU can skip the long explanation and step-by-step progressions.\n\n\nEditorial Review\nThe warmup flow is excellent, I will be using that for more than just kettlebell workouts. Prior to seeing this warmup example, I would warm up simply by briskly walking and maybe doing some jumping jacks. Your video has caused me to look at warmups also from a mobility perspective. The entire class now makes me pay more attention to form and pay attention to my mobility.\nI appreciate the extra detail that was spent during the kettlebell TGU video regarding hand/wrist position. I will pay more attention to wrist position, especially during more complex moves.\nThe Knee sweep during the pull under step is excellent advice and has helped me to overcome probably the biggest problem I had in learning to smoothly perform the Lunge Style Turkish Get Up.\nI also appreciated all of the additional “bonuses” such as completing a chest press during section 3 video to help get additional work in.\nThe concept of combos is one I never have heard of before and may not have thought of on my own. It makes excellent sense to incorporate something like the snatch to start and then complete a get-up. That kind of creativity in designing a workout is unbelievably valuable\nOne of the most appealing things regarding kettlebell training is how efficient and effective the exercises are. The combo examples you made further reinforces my appreciation of this form of exercise\nThe attention to detail regarding proper form and avoiding poor form mistakes is excellent. I am glad that the explanations are thorough in how to do the exercise using proper form, but I'm even more pleased that examples are made of things to avoid. Especially poor form that comes from poor conditioning or lack of mobility that can lead to injury. (such as the example of the regression of getting up with a racked kettlebell to avoid injury)\nThe points you make regarding mobility and proper form is exactly the type of advice that I appreciate and was looking for. The different styles of the get-ups along with beginner to advanced progressions demonstrates the commitment to safety and ensuring that we get the most out of the exercise. I will be progressing to the racked version of the get up using a kettlebell as my neck and upper body mobility needs more work.\nThe attention spent on proper form and avoiding injury is very appreciated. I have a lower back issue and appreciate the attention spent on proper form and only progressing to more advanced exercise once the basics have been mastered\nI do not think I’ve ever seen a video where someone sets expectations the way you do. By explaining that this exercise is not effective for cardio is an excellent point. Providing examples of how to increase cardio elements during this exercise is another great bonus as I really appreciate the efficiency of a kettlebell workout.\nOne of the biggest reasons that lead to my confusion regarding watching youtube demonstrations by other people is they referred to the Turkish Get Up as only that. I did not know there were so many variations. I would see the squat style and lunge and wonder who was right? I decided not to risk hurting myself due to the conflicting instructions I would see in many different places. Your videos are excellent as there is clear instruction, everything is defined very well so that I know exactly what I’m trying to replicate and why. Furthermore, starting out the progressions with bodyweight only then progressively increasing the level of difficulty by adding weight or a different variation is an excellent method that you used.\nElvin Kubicki\n\n\n\"I really appreciate the time and effort that has clearly gone into this course. As a coach myself, I found Taco to be very effective at emphasizing all the necessary pointers to master the get-up and as a result I have picked up a number of cues that will improve my own training and the clients I coach. Lastly, I am grateful for all the additional content including the fun no hands get up variations and the kettlebell get up variations I had yet to see before this course. Thank you Taco, nicely done.\" Randy Williams",

Train with TMax adheres to the philosophy of functional fitness, training things that will be useful in daily life. We believe that everyone should be able to perform normal daily actions effectively and without pain. The beauty of functional training is you can do it anywhere and anytime. You can train at home, in the park, or even at work!\nYou will be healthier, be developing a strong foundation for more advanced fitness and sports, and you will feel better. Your energy levels should rise and what you did in the first workout will seem like a warmup, after you finish the last workout in the program.\nThis program is designed to be done three times per week (i.e. Monday, Wednesday, Friday). On the rest days between, we recommend active rest exercises, like jogging, yoga, or swimming. The entire program should be completed in eight weeks, but you can modify it to last longer.\nWe are taking the tried and true methods that we've learned over the last two years from giving functional fitness classes to over 200 individuals in the group and individual training environment. The workouts are so customizable that a 10-year old, a 30-year old tennis player, and a 70-year old can both benefit from the same workout!\nIncluding the warm up, the workout, and the cooldown, you only need to dedicate 30-45 minutes per day!\n~~~~~~~~~~EN ESPAÑOL~~~~~~~~~~\nEste curso está diseñado para que cualquier persona sana de cualquier edad pueda hacer los entrenamientos de deporte. Train with TMax cree en la filosofia del fitness funcional, entrenar cosas que nos ayuden en la vida cotidiana.

Puedes entrenar en casa, en el parque, ¡incluso en el trabajo!\nEstarás más sano, desarrollarás una base fuerte para las actividades más avanzadas, y te sentirás mejor. Tus niveles de energía aumentarán y lo que hiciste en el primer entrenamiento parecerá como un calentamiento al terminar el curso.\nEste curso debe hacerse tres veces por semana (por ejemplo, lunes, miércoles, viernes). En los días de descanso, recomendamos actividades de descanso activos, como nadar, correr o yoga. El curso debe hacerse en ocho semanas, pero se puede modificarlo para que dure más.\nUsamos métodos demostrados y comprobados, que hemos aprendido durante los dos últimos años en clases de fitness funcional con más de 200 personas. Los entrenamientos son tan personalizables (a medida del cliente) que una niña de 10 años, un jugador de tenis con 30 años o incluso un hombre de 70 años, se beneficiarán del mismo entrenamiento.\nIncluyendo el calentamiento, el entrenamiento, y el cooldown, sólo tienes que dedicar 30-45 minutos al día!",

      "description": "Resistance bands are becoming more and more prevalent in the world of fitness. Proper use of resistance bands is comparable to training with free weights, dumbbells, and machines. Hundreds of thousands of people are training with resistance bands rather than going to expensive, crowded, judgemental gyms. This course examines every aspect of resistance bands training from beginner to advanced levels. This course is very informative as well as entertaining.\nThis course will encompass techniques such as  various hand grips, types of resistance bands, accessories, combining two or more bands, and changing resistance levels. Next we will explore specific resistance bands exercises that replicate actual gym exercises, training splits, and advanced techniques/philosophies, hybrid exercises, and even basic nutrition concepts. Finally, we show how you can use the bands in exotic locations such as beaches, parks, resorts, hotel rooms, and even on the job  outside of the traditional gym setting.\nThe information presented in this course will allow you to continue training when the gyms are closed for extended periods of time. It will eliminate the built-in excuses that so many have for not training. Take control of your life and your fitness by using resistance bands. Make your fitness your number one priority!",

If we know what we're doing we can build exceptional levels of strength and a phenomenal physique, using our body weight only.\n\n\nThis is about ability, not appearance. If you're done with training that leaves you stiff and injured instead of supple and bulletproof, you're in the right place.\n\n\nThis training will help you:\nAchieve real physical accomplishment and strength through the roof\nQuickly build an outstanding physique\nEliminate injury, stiffness and weakness\nProtect your joints and make them stronger for life\nDevelop useful, functional athletic ability\nIncrease energy levels and become more productive\nImprove your posture and move better, without pain\nMaximize efficiency and never waste time again\nAge gracefully, in a way that lets you enjoy life\n\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive but bodyweight training is actually the shortcut, it is the more effective and efficient way to build strength and get fit. Zero time wasted getting to a gym, and the exercises work the body as it evolved to work; not by using individual muscles, or portions of a muscle, but as an integrated unit. This means developing joints, tendons and the nervous system as well as the muscles.\n\n\nAnother advantage of bodyweight training is that you can start at any age and in almost any condition. This course is designed to help you become more powerful over time instead of wearing down. I have intentionally placed extra focus on the spine and back to counteract our sedentary modern lifestyle and byproducts like forward head posture.\n\n\nIf you want to be in better shape in your 50's than in your 20's I look forward to seeing you inside.",

The gluteal muscles stabilise our hips and knees while improving overall posture. Any movement involving standing, walking, running, sitting up, climbing, all include the gluteal muscles. You can't get from A to B without them and that's why I have designed this course because the FUNCTIONS of this muscle group are often overlooked when people are trying to exercise and this can lead to injury and an inefficient body. In this course you will learn the scientific functions of the glutes, what their benefits are, and how we can apply them in step by step exercise tutorials. So let's get your glutes fired up, your fitness through the roof, and stand with confidence knowing your glutes are doing the job they were designed for! I'll see you in the first video! Cheers, Jaspar.",

It starts off with the introductory lessons of Pilates and then there are numerous workouts that you can do using equipment and a multitude of workouts that you don't need any equipment for.\n\n\nPlease note, you don't need to buy equipment, there are plenty of workouts using things you'd readily have at home included.\n\n\nWorkouts that need home based equipment include:\n\n\n- Matwork\n- Metabolic\n- Weights (tinned food or water bottles will be perfect)\n- Wall (A wall, door or cupboard door)\n\n\nWorkouts that include equipment are:\n\n\n- Ball (stability ball usually 65cm or 75cm for taller people)\n- Small Ball (10 to 15cm ball)\n- Band (therapy band, any color that you have is great.. if you go get  a band Blue is the average resistance) Grey or black are stronger and every other color is lighter resistance)\n- Foam Roller (90cm  or longer in length)\n\n\nIt is recommended that you have a mat or soft surface to work on, carpeting or using a couple of towels will be perfect.\n\n\nPilates is a type of exercise system where you place your body in the correct alignment for each exercise. By doing this you lower exercise related risks and improve the quality of each move is increased ten fold.\n\n\nWhen you can hold the correct positions while performing an exercise, you start to work multiple muscle groups and those muscle groups are the precise ones that correct your posture. Do you want to make your workout more effective? This is the method for you.\n\n\nThere are Six Principles that oversee your Pilates practice. These include:\n\n\nBreathing\nRib Placement\nShoulder Placement\nActivating your Core muscles effectively\nHead Placement\nLower Back placement\n\n\nBetter than just improving your Pilates exercises you can then start to use these Six Principles when you do any other kind of exercise as well - Optimizing any fitness regiment you do.\n\n\nOnce we've learnt these Principles we'll start to build the foundation matwork exercises (one at a time) incorporating all six optimizers simultaneously.\n\n\nThis may sound daunting but you will get the hang of it easily. You can then spend time repeating these steps to grow your confidence or go on to do the full workouts provided.\n\n\nOnce you are proficient in the basics you can start working with the full workouts. I hope you enjoy the workouts. Please remember that Pilates is slow and controlled. Movements are usually smaller and less quick than what you'd expect.",

For most of that time I found myself to always be loose, flexible and healthy. Unfortunately, as I have entered my 30's I have been struggling with shoulder pain from the overuse created during all of those years playing ball. After consulting with Dr. Hoar I noticed improved flexibility and performance within my shoulders. The combination of training and education has dramatically improved the number of activities that I can participate in. I am now in two softball leagues and I swim and bike regularly. I've visited plenty of doctors in the past but nothing has worked as well as this.\"",

      "description": "Tai Chi or Shadow Boxing, another school of Kungfu in Chinese martial art culture, was born in Henan Province, 70km north to David Yao's native place.\nTai chi, short for T'ai chi ch'üan or Tàijí quán  (Chinese: 太极拳，太極拳; pinyin: Tàijí quán), is a traditional Chinese martial art which combines mind and awareness of our body, the deep diaphragmatic breathing and Qi, the inherent vital energy, through graceful movements to achieve mindfulness and relaxation. Tai chi is practiced for both its defense training, its health benefits and meditation.\nQigong, qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功 qìgōng literally: \"Life Energy Cultivation\") is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used in belief it promotes health, spirituality, and martial arts training. Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind.  Qigong can be viewed as a medicinal movement practice, combining breath work, relaxation, movement and self-massage all in one.\nIn this courses, I will show you through breath control exercise and Tai Chi Skill to regain the peace of mind.  Chen Style Traditional 74 Form LJ1  (陈氏太极拳老架一路  Chén shì tàijí quán lǎo jià yīlù  Chen Style Tai Chi Traditional Form  One; Chen Style Tai Chi Old Form Set One)  is the foundation of all Chen Style Tai Chi which keeps the kicking, jumping and leaping movements which will apply in fighting.\nWhat makes  Chen Style Tai Chi unique? It is 发力 fā lì, (releasing power; releasing power in explosive way),  It integrates whole body power and keep body in a relax states when release the power in very short and explosive way. The hitting point can be fist, elbow or knee. This Fali is different with boxing or kickboxing. You can take some movements to practice in fast speed and this can be very good sweating workout for you.\n\n\nThis will take you around 3 month to finish it. However, you can just take a single posture to practice.\n\n\nTai Chi Strengthens Mind and Body\nTai Chi’s focus on posture and body placement may add benefits beyond what cardiovascular or resistance-training can provide.\nTai Chi, a moving Yoga, does more than burn calories and tone muscles. It will enable you to gain flexibility and strength, reducing stress and allowing for greater relaxation. It's a total mind-body workout that combines strengthening and stretching poses with deep breathing and meditation or relaxation.\nThe health benefits of tai chi\nThis gentle form of exercise can help maintain strength, flexibility, and balance, and could be the perfect activity for the rest of your life.\nTai chi is often described as \"meditation in motion, moving Yoga,\"  which originated in China as a martial art.  The Chen Style Tai chi is the oldest and parent form of the five traditional family styles of Tai chi. Chen-style is characterized by Silk reeling, alternating fast/slow motion and bursts of power.  The Chen Style is Originated in Hen Nan Chen Jia Gou, 70 KM at north of David Yao's birth place.\nThere is growing evidence that this mind-body practice, has value in treating or preventing many health problems. And you can get started even if you aren't in top shape or the best of health.  In this low-impact, slow-motion exercise, you go without pausing through a series of motions.  As you move, you breathe deeply and naturally, focusing your attention — as in some kinds of meditation — on your bodily sensations. Tai chi differs from other types of exercise in several respects. The movements are usually circular and never forced, the muscles are relaxed rather than tensed, the joints are not fully extended or bent, and connective tissues are not stretched. Tai chi can be easily adapted for anyone, from the most fit to people confined to wheelchairs or recovering from surgery.",

      "description": "Learn Indian Traditional Workout with MuddyMuscles® – The Complete Akhada Experience\nGuided by Chief Instructor Sensei Sudarshan and CEO Kyoshi Arun Dev\nFor centuries, India’s warriors, wrestlers, and martial artists built their bodies not in air-conditioned gyms, but in the raw earth of the akhada — a training ground where every move was born from necessity, discipline, and survival. They didn’t just train for strength; they trained for life. Now, in an era where modern fitness trends rise and fade like seasons, MuddyMuscles® brings back this ancient, battle-tested system, making it accessible to anyone who seeks real power, real stamina, and a real connection to heritage.\nOur Mission – More Than Just a Workout\nMuddyMuscles® is not a brand that sells “just another fitness course.” We are a movement — dedicated to reviving and preserving India’s traditional fitness heritage. Founded by Kyoshi Arun Dev, a martial arts master with over three decades of experience, and led in training by Sensei Sudarshan, a dynamic and highly skilled Chief Instructor, MuddyMuscles® delivers training that is authentic, effective, and empowering.\nWhen you train with us, you’re not just exercising; you’re stepping into the shoes of ancient warriors, building the same strength, resilience, and fighting spirit that kept them battle-ready for life’s challenges.\nWhy Traditional Indian Training?\nModern fitness programs often isolate muscles with machines and repetitive patterns. Traditional Indian workouts — perfected over centuries — train the whole body, mind, and spirit together. They focus on functional strength, explosive endurance, core stability, mental toughness, and flexibility — the very traits needed in battle and equally valuable in everyday life.\nSome of the most respected combat athletes and wrestlers in the world still use these methods to dominate in strength, stamina, and resilience. The science is simple: bodyweight and natural resistance training, done in structured movements, keeps the body lean, powerful, and injury-resistant.\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course\nOur training is divided into 17 structured video modules, each carefully designed to take you from beginner to athlete level, without skipping the basics. Every move you learn has stood the test of time, used by generations of Indian wrestlers (pehalwans), warriors, and martial artists.\nYou will master:\n1. Dand (Push-up Variations)\nSadharan Dand – The foundational Indian push-up, excellent for upper body strength and spine flexibility.\nSarp Dand – Snake-like motion that builds flexibility and total-body coordination.\nVrishic Dand – Scorpion-style movement for explosive shoulder and arm power.\nMishra Dand – A combination dand for strength and endurance together.\nParshva Dand – Side variation for oblique and lateral core strength.\nHanuman Dand – Powerful stance-based push-up for energy and power.\nChakra Dand – Rotational push-up improving agility and flexibility.\nSher Dand – Lion-like movement that builds chest and arm dominance.\n2. Baithak (Squat Variations)\nSadharan Baithak – The traditional deep squat for leg power and flexibility.\nPehalwani Baithak – Wrestler’s squat for explosive lower body drive.\nDand Baithak Combo – Integrating push and squat movements for full-body burn.\n3. Sapate\nA high-intensity movement for stamina, coordination, and fight-readiness. Increases cardiovascular capacity and leg speed.\n4. Kick Through\nA mobility and agility exercise from traditional akhada warm-ups — improves joint health and explosive transitions.\n5. Final Combo\nA complete sequence combining all dand, baithak, and sapate moves — designed to give you the ultimate akhada-style workout you can do anywhere, anytime, with no equipment.\nThe Benefits You Will Gain\nPhysical Strength & Power\nEvery dand, baithak, and sapate movement is a compound exercise — meaning multiple muscles work together in harmony. Over time, you’ll notice a powerful change:\nStronger chest, arms, shoulders, and back\nThicker, more stable legs\nA powerful core that supports everything you do\nEndurance & Stamina\nUnlike machine workouts, these exercises demand total body effort, building muscular endurance and cardio capacity at the same time. You’ll be able to work longer, recover faster, and push further.\nFlexibility & Agility\nMovements like Sarp Dand, Chakra Dand, and Kick Through keep your joints healthy, spine flexible, and reflexes sharp. You won’t just be strong — you’ll be mobile and fast.\nMental Toughness & Discipline\nAkhada training isn’t just physical — it’s a mental challenge. The repetition, the flow, the discipline… these are traits you carry into every part of life. You’ll feel more focused, confident, and ready to face challenges.\nRooted in Heritage\nWhen you train the MuddyMuscles® way, you’re keeping alive a tradition that once prepared soldiers and wrestlers for real battle. You become part of a legacy, training the same way that has been passed down for centuries.\nWhy Train With MuddyMuscles®?\nLed by Experts – You’re learning directly from Sensei Sudarshan (Chief Instructor) and Kyoshi Arun Dev (CEO & Course Director), both with unmatched expertise in martial arts and traditional fitness.\nAuthentic Training – Every move is taught in its pure form, not diluted by trends.\nStructured Learning – Step-by-step modules ensure you master form before intensity.\nNo Equipment Needed – Train anywhere — all you need is space and your body.\nCultural Pride – Be part of reviving India’s fitness heritage.\nHow This Course Works\nEach video module covers:\nDemonstration – See the move performed with perfect form.\nBreakdown – Learn step-by-step how to do it safely.\nBenefits – Understand why it works and what muscles it targets.\nTips & Warm-Up Guidance – Prevent injuries and improve performance.\nWe also include combo videos so you can link movements together for full-body conditioning.\nWarm-Up Importance\nWe cannot stress enough: A proper warm-up is non-negotiable. Before starting dand, baithak, or sapate, you must prepare your joints, muscles, and heart rate. This reduces injury risk and improves your training results. We guide you through traditional Indian warm-ups to get you ready.\nWho Is This For?\nFitness enthusiasts seeking authentic, time-tested training\nMartial artists looking to build functional strength and stamina\nBeginners wanting to start a sustainable, equipment-free workout\nAthletes from any sport needing explosive power and endurance\nAnyone proud to embrace India’s rich physical culture\nThe MuddyMuscles® Promise\nWe believe in authenticity over trends, discipline over shortcuts, and heritage over gimmicks. This course will not just make you stronger — it will connect you to a training lineage that shaped India’s greatest warriors.\nAt the end of this course, you won’t just have learned dand, baithak, and sapate — you will have gained:\nA functional, powerful physique\nMental resilience\nA deep sense of cultural pride\nThe confidence to train anywhere, anytime\nStart Your Warrior Journey Today\nJoin Sensei Sudarshan and Kyoshi Arun Dev in this one-of-a-kind MuddyMuscles® training experience. Build the strength of a wrestler, the stamina of a soldier, and the discipline of a martial artist — all while honoring India’s ancient fitness heritage.\nAll it takes is a plain piece of ground, a will to train, and the guidance we provide. No machines. No excuses. Just the warrior spirit.",

They conducted a study using an interval-based training model.\nDr. Tabata took two groups and put them on an exercise program for six weeks. The control group did one hour of moderate-intensity exercise five times a week.The other group did the high-intensity Tabata-style training, which equates to 20/10 session repeated eight times. 20/10 simply means 20 seconds of all-out exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated 8 times. This adds up to four minutes total. That equates to 1,800 minutes of training for the control group versus 120 minutes of training for the Tabata group over the six-week period.\nThe Tabata group improved both its aerobic and anaerobic fitness levels. In addition to increased fat loss through respiration the Tabata group also increased their anaerobic fitness level by 28% which stimulated additional fat loss through the lactic acid pathway\nThis Tabata methodology of training has been shown in numerous controlled studies to burn up to 9 TIMES as much body fat as traditional steady-state cardio while also stimulating the development of lean muscle mass.\nIt doesn't matter if you're just getting started with a fitness program or if you have years of training experience under your belt this program can serve as both a starting point and also help you blast through plateaus in your current training and accelerate your fat loss.\nI'm so excited that you've decided to join me and will be training with me for the next 31 days. It's true 31 days, one month isn't an excessively long period of time, however, this science-based program is designed to produce big results in a short time.\nIf you truly commit yourself and follow this program as it is designed you will get results...PERIOD!\nIt really is that simple……... I SAID IT IS SIMPLE, I DID NOT SAY IT IS EASY, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO WORK HARD, BUST YOUR ASS AND PUSH YOURSELF OVER THE NEXT MONTH IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!\nBut everything you need to succeed is laid out here for you. I've created unique, custom workouts designed to give you that lean hard body you've always wanted!\nThroughout this entire program, you'll never be alone. What I mean is that unlike most other programs that give you a list of exercises to do on your own, here you just press play and follow along with me.\nI'm there with you sweating, working hard, through every exercise and every repetition. I'll be right there working out with you, coaching, guiding, encouraging and pushing you to become the very best you can be. This is a truly interactive program, we're in this together!\nEven better you don’t a gym or any fancy equipment.  We only use bodyweight exercise and resistance bands for everything we do, so you can do these workouts anywhere anytime!\nNot only does this program take out all the guesswork out your training I also provide you with a complete food and nutrition guide that is clinically and scientifically proven to enable you to burn body fat, build lean muscle and transform your body!\nIf you’re truly serious about getting that lean, hard body you’ve always wanted you’ve come to the right place. Go ahead, enroll now and let’s get busy transforming your body and your life!\nI’ll see you inside the course and I can not wait to see your transformation over the next 31-days!",

One thing I was sure about.\nWe all have the same capabilities to achieve anything we want.\nHowever, I saw along the way a lot of people struggling and not achieving what they were going for, even though they had a full plan to follow and everything prepared for them step by step.\nSo I started to go in a deep research about our nature as human beings and that's how I became a Lifestyle Trainer.\nWhat I found out is that people don't lack information about their diets or workouts because you can find an infinite amount of information about it, but they lack information about themselves and what they really want out of their life.\n80% of Success is psychology and 20% is mechanics - Tony Robbins\n\nI love this quote by Tony Robbins as it states clear how everything works.\nYou can have the right strategy that will save you decades in progress, but if you don't have the psychology and take action on that strategy, it has no use at all because you won't apply it.\nThis is why in \"How To Master The Art of Being Lean\" course will start with the fundamentals of your mind and set it up for success before going into the physical part of it, starting with...\nWriting down your goals on a subconscious level\nFinding your \"WHY\" and the reason for your change\nFinding absolute certainty and belief that you can achieve the goal you set\nBuilding a strong morning ritual to prepare you for success everyday\nHow to change your mood by moving your body and the way you breathe\nAnd practising and repeating to achieve mastery of yourself\nAll of these are the fundamentals we all need in order to succeed in anything, especially when it comes to your body and changing your old habits. This is the hardest part when you set a new goal.\nWhen you understand how your mind works, following a workout plan and a diet plan will be effortless and enjoyable!\nOnce that is done, we need the right strategy to achieve our goal, which will start with...\nDetoxifying the body and allow it to clean itself\nAnd Intermittent Fasting\nNow you may think: \"Fasting sounds Terrible and I will starve myself\"\nBefore you go thinking too deep about that, let's think outside the box for a minute.\nAs a trainer, I have found that my clients have a hard time eating the recommended 4-6 smaller meals per day because it is inconvenient.\n*You are never really full or satisfied when eating 4-8 meals a day.\nSo if you are trying to lose weight, you are going to be more tempted to overeat and sabotage your own weight loss.\nEating that frequently also makes you tired and drains your energy because your body is constantly using the energy to digest the food in your stomach.\nWho has the time to eat or think about eating ALL THE TIME during their busy work day?\nIf you are trying to..\nTorch Body Fat\nLose Weight\nImprove your energy levels\nBuild and Preserve Quality Muscle Mass\nAnd Triple Your Focus and Productivity\nThen Intermittent Fasting will be able to accomplish all of these just by making a few changes to the way you eat right now.\nTry this course for 30 days and if you aren't completely satisfied with the results that you are seeing, you can get 100% of your money back.\n\nI am here to guide you to find the best solution that works for you, because there is no individual blueprint for everyone.\nUpon completion of the course, you'll see how the quality of your daily life, is always determined by the quality of decisions you make.\n\nI'm very excited that you took the time to view this course.\nEnroll Now and let's create real lasting change together!\nClick the Red Button above to get started NOW!",

I am going to break the drill categories down into 7 ( seven ) categories and show you how we are going to start with some basic warm-up drills. And next, we are going to jump right into point guard skill development drills. There are several wonderful exceptional brand new drills waiting for us.\nIf you want to be a perfect point guard, you should overcome this different kind of pressure. You should handle this pressure, and always be ready to take the responsibilities for your team and the critical moments of the game.\nWhen you are comfortable with the ball, you can drive the ball fast and control the game. When you are able to pass the ball to your teammates correctly and in time, when you get in touch with your coach and dribble under big pressure, you will be a point guard candidate. If you are a perfect point guard, you stay in the game and use the ball in the most critical moment of the game.\nI am going to explain all popular point guard example drills and when you repeat them regularly, you are going to be more comfortable with the ball, and you can reach your target faster.\nThese drills can help you to react quicker and beat defender. You can also improve your ball-handling skills to higher level with repeating these drill series.",

I will cover all different kinds of aspects that will help you understand the stance, movement, flexibility, mind-muscle connection, strength, and other things required for a good safe, and effective squat.\n\n\nI will explain how you can build yourself or your clients (if you're a trainer) up from not being able to squat at all or experiencing pains to being able to squat deep with no pain.\nAfter teaching the bodyweight progressions of the squat I will cover many resistance exercises with the kettlebell from simple exercises to more complex and double kettlebell exercises. All exercises can be done with just one kettlebell, dumbbells, TRX, or even with a barbell.\n\n\nMore than anything, I will provide you with the knowledge to program for yourself, but at the same time, I will also provide templates that can be used if you don't want to invest the time into programming the best options for yourself.\n\n\nLEARN TO SQUAT FOR:\nStrength\nFlexibility\nCardio\nFat loss\nExercise\nSitting\nEase of movement\nIncreased life expectancy\n\n\nOver 3 hours of video content covering the squat.\nBE PREPARED TO BE IMMERSED IN THE SQUAT\nWARNING: This is not a quick superficial course, this is very in-depth, I want you to know this upfront as it's not a 30-minute thing that you just breeze through.",

      "description": "BENEFITS OF RESISTANCE BAND  TRAINING\n· Strengthen and tone your whole body and put minimal stress on our joints, reducing the chance of injury.\n· You can change the intensity of your workout gradually by increasing the resistance of the band, which means you can progress at your own pace.\n· Bands are light and portable so you can use them at home, or even when you are away or in the office. This saves you time and money as you don’t need a gym membership.\n· They add variety to your training program, so you don’t get bored and stay motivated.\n· When bands are combined with Pilates exercises our muscle fibres are strengthened much more as you can work on each muscle group individually.\nABOUT THIS PROGRAM\nThe Resistance Band Super Strength Series- Sydney, consists of 12 short videos that can be completed over a 7-day period, or at your own pace depending on your fitness level. Each video is specifically designed to strengthen one part of your body including the legs, arms, back, core and feet. There are also 3 stretching videos included in the program.\nIt is recommended that you do the videos once per day and repeat the series 3 times if possible, to gain maximum benefit. You can change the resistance band strength along the way as your strength increases.\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nYour personal online instructor is Dr Fleur who is a qualified Chiropractor, Pilates teacher and personal trainer with 19 years’ experience in the health and fitness field and previously was an elite athlete. She created this safe and effective resistance band series for people that are fairly new to exercise or have suffered injuries previously and want to gain strength again, as she knows from personal experience how frustrating it can be to train in big gyms with minimal help from qualified instructors.\nWhen she was living in Hong Kong from 2017-2019, she found that the gyms there were catering for people that were at a much higher fitness level. Fleur had suffered a back injury while training to be an elite athlete many years ago and a recent flare-up of symptoms meant that she had to be very careful at the gym and couldn’t cope with the intensity of training in group exercise classes. After feeling sore and disillusioned for a few months she decided to create a safe, low impact resistance band program that could help people like herself that were frustrated with gyms and group classes.\nThis resistance band course is the first of a 2-part series that she created for people that want to gain strength safely and effectively and was filmed in Sydney, Australia. The second part was shot in beautiful Santo Island, Vanuatu just before lockdown in March 2020 (can be purchased on Udemy separately).\nJoin now and you will be taking a step toward staying active, healthy and happy as you age!\nYou can ask Dr Fleur any questions that you may have along the way through the Udemy platform or by accessing the course Facebook group.",

      "description": "Physical fitness begins with emotional fitness.\nMosaic Method is a groundbreaking training that provides fitness instructors and enthusiasts with a thorough understanding of how the brain reacts to music, and how that affects our mind, body and emotions. Pulling from several decades of experience as professional musicians, music supervisors, DJs and yoga instructors, as well as years spent studying the latest neuroscience research in the fields of music and movement, founders Derek Beres and Philip Steir have created Mosaic Method to help better incorporate music in fitness and help people get the most out of their classes and workouts..\nMosaic Method helps you create a total mind-body experience for your students. Through a deep understanding of movement, music, and emotions, you gain insights into personal and professional creative expression. While the method can be applied to any movement discipline, our four modules are:\n◦ Main Studio (cardiorespiratory/metabolic training)\n◦ Yoga\n◦ Studio Cycling\n◦ Dance\nInstructors and movement professionals will learn music's intriguing effects on our brains and nervous systems. Mosaic Method helps teachers create better playlists and aids in more targeted sequencing, as well as understand the emotional foundation of their clients and students (and themselves!). This will help them forge lasting relationships and bonds.\nMany instructors focus on music's entertainment value without understanding its value as a motivational and therapeutic tool. Music was encoded inside of us through evolution to convey information, share emotions, soothe infants, motivate warriors, form social bonds, and open the door to trance-like Flow states.\nMost professionals are aware of music's motivational impact: a driving, steady beat helps divert the mind from the unpleasant aspects of physical exertion and boredom, as well as increases one's heart rate, blood flow and pain threshold. New scientific research shows that music also helps improve muscle coordination and aid muscles so they use less energy and become more effective. But this is only one part of the journey. What about relaxation and stress relief, as well as dealing with difficult emotional situations? Music covers it all.\nSome of the topics we discuss in the training:\n◦ The investigation of the power of music on the brain/mind/body.\n◦ The origins of music and its effects on cultures.\n◦ How music has shaped our species and societies.\n◦ Why music has a strong effect on our emotions, and how we can use music to address different emotions at different times.\n◦ How music makes us move our bodies.\n◦ How music engages our sensory motor systems.\n◦ How to use music to enter Flow states.\n◦ How music brings people together in communities, and how to best utilize this knowledge in a group fitness setting.\n◦ Therapeutic uses of music, the fastest growing area of the music business.\n◦ The science of background music.\n◦ The psychological and physiological aspects of rhythm.\nMosaic Method also provides instructors with practical information, knowledge, and strategies for incorporating music by using our history of placing music in film and TV. We investigate how film composers and music supervisors use music to show you how this skill can be applied in class.\nUpon completion of this program fitness instructors will understand how to choose music to create their own unique class for whatever moods they are seeking to evoke. The result is not only a better studio experience, but the ability to help your clients—as well as yourself—deal with a wide range of emotions, from sadness and despair to anger and anxiety, with a deep understanding and awareness of music and movement's effects on our brains and bodies.\nAs an external stimulus music is a key ingredient in helping athletes achieve peak performance as well as being a doorway to reaching Flow states. Music is not secondary to fitness—it is a driving force behind movement and mind. Mosaic Method brings all this information together in an easy to understand and exciting format that can support your teaching in a revolutionary new way.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This program is designed for fitness professionals and enthusiasts. It will be especially beneficial to main studio, cycling, dance and yoga instructors, though anyone looking to gain a firm understanding of the neurochemistry of music and movement will benefit."

      "description": "These two pieces of Pilates equipment are so versatile.\n\n\nJane used to call the foam roller \"Hell Roller\" until her Biokineticist told her that rolling out her muscles would help remove her aches and pains. After that she requested more and more of it. She witnessed the results first hand and now so can you; from the comfort of your own home and in your own time.\n\n\nYou'll be amazed at how many exercises we can do using them and working your balance almost throughout the workouts. By working balance your stabilizers activate and that means that your deep core muscles (that support your lower back) are being strengthened. This leads to more comfort and ease of living.\n\n\nYour mobility is increased. Lower Back pain due to tight muscles at the base of your spine are relieved. Your overall strength is improved and this all happens while you are having fun non strenuous exercise routines.\n\n\nYou will start with recapping the basics of Pilates and how to do the fundamental exercises. If you already know these, skip across to the workout sections.\n\n\nFrom there we will alternate Ball and Foam Roller classes and I've added a stretch class in as well.\n\n\nDon't take mine, Jane's or her Bio's word for it - try it for yourself!\n\n\nJust remember these are home made lessons using my 17 years of Pilates experience. I hope to skill share and bring you joy while you workout.",

Thousands have already transformed their bodies—are you ready to be next?\nAre you stuck in the cycle of endless gym hours, ineffective workouts, and frustrating diet plans? If you've battled the \"skinny-fat\" struggle, just like I did years ago, I've got some game-changing insights for you.\nI used to spend countless hours in the gym doing pointless cardio, neglecting protein intake, and sweating over the wrong exercises, all while failing to track my progress. The mirror was a constant source of disappointment.\nI dabbled in \"celebrity diets,\" attempted clean eating, and even flirted with programs promising miraculous \"hacks\" and \"shortcuts,\" not to mention fat burners that vowed to \"melt away fat.\" I blamed my corporate night shifts, erratic sleep, and supposedly \"skinny\" genetics for my lack of progress.\nBut when I took matters into my own hands, educated myself, and put the nutrition and training principles you'll find in this program into action, the transformation was nothing short of remarkable – all while enduring those gruelling night shifts. In fact, my newfound physique even clinched first place in my first bodybuilding competition.\nWhat Awaits You in This Program:\nDiscover the secrets to transforming your \"skinny-fat\" physique while relishing the foods you genuinely love. You'll engage in 3 to 5 effective strength training workouts every week and can even opt for some optional cardio sessions.\nNo need to bid farewell to your night shift job or other shift work – we'll help you shred fat by managing cortisol levels without any disruptions to your schedule.\nForget the obsession with \"clean eating\" or constant sugar avoidance – I didn't do it, and I still enjoyed the occasional chocolate treat.\nLeave behind the notion that you must live at the gym – my workouts were a concise 60 to 70 minutes at most.\nDitch the myth that you need special ab exercises for a chiseled six-pack – I sculpted mine with just 10 to 15 minutes of targeted ab work, twice a week.\nSay goodbye to endless hours on the treadmill – I spent a maximum of 3 hours on cardio each week to achieve that shredded look.\nNo performance-enhancing drugs, steroids, or shortcuts here – just patience and trust in the process. (Note: Many so-called \"fitness influencers\" are not being honest about their use of these substances.)\nYou won't be forced into strange diets like intermittent fasting, keto, or veganism to see results. Instead, I'll introduce you to IIFYM, a lifestyle that transformed my life.\nBid farewell to the myths and falsehoods surrounding six-pack abs and quick fixes. Ignore 99% of the exaggerated claims made by supplement companies.\nNavigating the fitness world is challenging, with a maze of harmful lies and myths to contend with. I've been there, and I know how overwhelming it can be. That's why I've distilled the complex science from the broscience to create a program rooted in tried-and-true principles that have shaped the fittest people on the planet.\nThis program isn't about revealing ground-breaking secrets; it's about cutting through the noise and presenting a straightforward (though not necessarily easy) blueprint that anyone can follow. Say goodbye to the confusion and welcome the transformation you've always wanted.\nUnlock Your Full Potential with This Program!\n\n\nScience-Backed Success: This program is your gateway to evidence-based fitness and nutrition. We've compiled hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies, ensuring that every aspect is grounded in solid research, providing you with quantifiable results that you can trust.\nProven Track Record: Since its launch in 2016, we've empowered over 22,000 individuals just like you to transform their bodies and lives. This program is a living, evolving entity, continually updated with the latest breakthroughs in nutrition and exercise science. The 2nd edition, released in 2021, reflects our commitment to staying on the cutting edge.\nEat What You Love: No more bland, uninspiring diets! Our program will guide you in crafting meal plans that help you build muscle and shed fat while savouring the foods you genuinely enjoy. No more feeling starved or deprived – we're here to dispel the notion that fitness requires a chicken and rice regimen.\nSupplement Smarts: Say goodbye to wasted dollars on ineffective fitness supplements. We provide you with a no-BS guide to the world of supplements, ensuring that you invest wisely in products that truly enhance your fitness journey. Most sports supplements on the market are nothing more than hype – we'll steer you clear of these pitfalls.\nFlip the Script: If you've been trapped in the \"skinny fat\" mindset, believing genetics are the culprit, or that you must endure monotonous diets and gruelling gym sessions, it's time to rewrite your story. This program will shatter those limiting beliefs and pave the way for your transformation.\nEnrol in this program today and embark on the path to becoming leaner, stronger, and more confident in your appearance and well-being. Trust us – this journey is worth every step.\nLet's Do This!",

Without The Mistakes, Guesswork And Frustration That Most Men Face?\n\nBodybuilding Masterclass for Beginners (2021)\nThe Complete Muscle Building Course for Men\nFully updated 29/01/2021\n\n\nThis course is for those who want a complete, engaging, and practical approach to getting ripped, where everything is made clear to both understand and implement right away. Its a 3 hour course that only needs to be taken once, and then you’ll never have to go traipsing through magazines and forums again.\nIf you want a simple proven approach to bulking, cutting and maintaining that covers training, nutrition, goal setting and mindset, then it’s for you\nIt’s not for you if you’re looking for extensive biomedical explanations as to why the method works, or if you believe in ‘Bro Science’.\nWhy do some people who stick to a plan get minimal gains... or even none, whilst others build incredible bodies with consistent gains?\n\nThere are a few fundamentals which if done consistently over time will lead you to the body of your dreams, guaranteed.  The difficulty is sifting through all the industry BS to know exactly what these fundamentals are.  The process of getting ripped has been massively over-complicated to help companies sell more magazines and supplements.  If it wasn’t like this these companies would go out of business as there is no way you could fill a whole magazine each month with new discoveries about basic training principles that have been around for hundreds of years.\nThis course takes what has been made into a complicated subject and lays it out in plain and simple terms, providing a framework that anyone can take and apply to their own circumstances, to achieve their body goals.\n\n\nHere are 5 reasons why you should take the course:\nLearn a proven approach to training, that you can take and apply to right away, even without access to a gym.\nLearn the keys to creating Bulking, Cutting and Maintenance Nutrition Plans that Leave You Feeling Satisfied, Nourished and Energetic.\nDiscover the TOP 5 Myths and Mistakes that are Ruining Your Results Right Now and you don't even know it.\nMaster Your Inner-game, Self-Discipline, and Make Your Determination Explode\nIdentify Destructive Behaviors that are Stopping You from Achieving your goals, and Replace them with Habits of Success\n\n\nHere are some reasons why you might not take the course:\nYou have that niggling sense of doubt that we all get before we make a purchase - The course comes with Udemys 30 day 100% money back guarantee so rest assured there's absolutely no risk on your part.\nThere’s lots of other courses on the same subject - I believe this is the most comprehensive all-in one course on the subject on Udemy.  In many cases, you have to purchase multiple courses from an instructor to cover the whole subject.  Not here, everything’s included including access to me.\nYou’ve seen a negative review - The course is a leaving, breathing organism and I update it regularly.  Whenever I receive feedback that I can use to improve the course, I do so. As you will see from the comment & ratings below I reach out to students to learn more about both positive and negative experiences.  I want you to enjoy the course as much as I did creating it. If you are any less than 5* satisfied I encourage you to refund your investment with Udemys 100% money back guarantee.\nYou’re not sure if the course is right for you - The course provides a complete framework that you can apply to your own individual circumstances. It teaches principles that have been proven to work, time and time again.  Rather than showing you how to perform bicep curls, it gives you the principles behind the types of exercises that get you the most bang for your buck. The same with nutrition. I show you the kinds of nutrition that work and why. I show you what I eat, and I show you how you can design your own nutrition plan that satisfies your own personal needs. I don’t give you a generic ‘one size fits all’ meal plan because we all have individual tastes, wants and needs.\n***Important*** In the course I treat you like an adult that has the ability to take principles, and then apply them to your own circumstances and goals.  One of the keys to getting ripped long term is being proactive in making your regimen work for you. If you’re looking to be spoon fed everything on a plate with zero pro-activeness on your part, then don’t take the course.\n\n\nHere’s what students are saying:\n“This course is so great because it is universal. It does not show you how to curl your biceps, but describes the mechanisms which work, so that you can work out the details for yourself and still get the results. This is exactly the knowledge I was looking for.”\n“I have been training for about 1,5 years and after going through this course making notes i can see how much i have been doing wrong. I am confident and looking forward to seeing greater results than i have been before.”\nI've tried many different workout plans and different diets and I suck at all of them.. Mainly because there are so many things to do.. I like this training , because he takes out all the hipe and BS and just gives the basics you should do. plan and easy..”\n“Learning a lot basic stuffs from it. As a beginner this is the course of my choice. Thanks to the instructor for designing this amazing course. I pray and wish I could gain muscle following this course.”\n\n\nIf you’re ready to take control of your gains and finally achieve the body you’ve always wanted then enroll now and I’ll see you inside!\nMichael",

Instead of pounding the pavement, rebounding as a form of aerobic exercise has proven to be just as beneficial as running. In fact, 10 minutes of jumping can burn the same amount of fat as a 30-minute run. That’s roughly 1,000 calories an hour.\nTrampoline exercises are low-impact on the joints while getting your heart rate up. The springs absorb up to 80% of the shock you would typically feel doing a jump on the ground, but your muscles will still receive all the benefits.\nTrampoline exercise increase your lymphatic flow and detox the body. In just 10 minutes, you can experience 15 times more lymphatic flow when you’re jumping. This conscious movement and changes in gravity help remove toxins and increase your immune system.\nTrampoline workouts increase bone mass. After menopause, women may lose up to 20% or more bone density. But jumping just 20 times a day can increase bone mass, and has been shown to prevent conditions like osteoporosis and help with arthritis even more so than running.\nTrampoline workouts are great for all age groups, from littles up to seniors.\nTrampoline workouts are FUN. Bounce, dance and move your body!\n\n\nThe latest research on mini fitness trampoline workouts.\nHow to become aware of, and improve your posture.\nHow to improve flexibility.\nCombining basic moves and sequencing ideas.\nLearn foundation exercises that include set up, execution, progressions and modifications for all fitness levels and abilities.",

I will explain many kettlebell swing variations, demonstrate them, and explain why you would want to do one over the other. I will also cover goals, programming, and even provide you with 7 awesome kettlebell swing workouts that achieve different goals. With all this information you will have everything to work out and even start thinking for yourself.\n\n\nThis is the premium version of Master The Kettlebell Swing and includes:\nA downloadable copy of the popular Amazon book Master The Basic Kettlebell Swing\nA downloadable copy of the popular Amazon book Master The Hip Hinge\nKettlebell swing workouts\n2 hours of video content\n\n\nThis course by Cavemantraining takes you from knowing absolutely nothing about the kettlebell swing to swinging safely and effectively.\nWARNING: Only enroll in this course if you are truly interested to go deep into the kettlebell swing. If you are not interested in details and are looking for something quick then this is not the right course to choose.\n\n\nWith over a decade of kettlebell experience, I will break the kettlebell swing down and provide details that you've not heard before and will change the way you train with kettlebells.\nWith the course, there are several workouts included that you can complete with the kettlebell swing and I will also explain some things about programming so that you can put your own customized workouts together in the form of EMOM, interval training, AMRAP, FOR TIME, and so on.\nSome of the kettlebell swing variations covered:\nConventional hip hinge swing\nSquat swing\nHardstyle swing\nPendulum swing\nAmerican swing\nSuitcase swing\nDouble-arm swing\nSingle-arm swing\nAlternating swing\nAnd more...\n\n\nCrossFit\nIf you're a crossfitter I guarantee that you will improve your American swing and will get the edge over your competitors! If you're a trainer, you're going to learn how to progress your clients properly.\n\n\nFeedback\n\"I will be honest with you and explain my background. I have been a trainer (both in sport and media) for most of my life. The birth of the internet and youtube lead to less and less, face-to-face training/coaching, focusing more on video demos and training. I mention this just to help you understand where I came from, which is a background of producing corporate short, punchy to the point training content.\nThe course content was absolutely excellent. The gradual build from a squat swing, progressing to the hip and pendulum, and reasons why you would use each one, together with their own variations, were spot on. Your knowledge, wisdom, and experience really shine through, anyone taking this course would gain significant benefits from this coaching and knowledge sharing.\nI also enjoyed the 4 stage format of teaching/learning format. The explanation of why and how to perform each variation, the slowmo demo's, then the PA session, and finally the tests.\"\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation.

I like to drag kettlebells to places no kettlebell has gone before and teach people the art of kettlebell training. Cautionary warning: On our journey through the 21 days you might also see the appearance of Nacho (our French bulldog).\n\n\nDay 1 Warming up and priming for kettlebell training\nDay 2 Stretching and mobility for kettlebell training\nDay 3 Kettlebell anatomy and grip\nDay 4 Safely lifting the kettlebell with a squat\nDay 5 Safely lifting the kettlebell with a hip hinge\nDay 6 Assisted kettlebell clean\nDay 7 Kettlebell squat swing\nDay 8 Kettlebell hip hinge swing\nDay 9 Kettlebell pendulum swing\nDay 10 Double arm swing clean\nDay 11 Kettlebell dead clean\nDay 12 Kettlebell swing clean\nDay 13 Kettlebell racking\nDay 14 Kettlebell pressing\nDay 15 Kettlebell rowing\nDay 16 Kettlebell American swing\nDay 17 Double kettlebell dead swing clean\nDay 18 Recap and additional kettlebell tips\nDay 19 Kettlebell programming and goals\nDay 20 Kettlebell workout\nDay 21 Common kettlebell injuries and annoyances\n\n\nThis kettlebell course is structured so that you can work on your progression day by day over 21 days, or you can choose to complete one after the other and see each day as a step towards your progression in kettlebell training.\n\n\nEach unit has a video, in total there are over 140 minutes of video content that covers kettlebell training. Each day has 5 to 10 minutes of video which is followed by a text summary you can read, copy, and save for future reference by downloading it as a PDF. Most days will have an optional task/drill to perform or progression to work on over time.\nThis course has no exam questions, the course is designed to bring across the knowledge you need to start your kettlebell training journey via video and bullet point summaries with an optional public assessment for form and technique check.\n\n\nAfter more than a decade of kettlebell training I have been able to put together the progressions I use with my athletes, clients, and students. I'm extremely confident that this online kettlebell course will help you understand kettlebell training so that you can train or workout safely at home, in the gym, outdoors, or in your CrossFit box.\nYou will learn how to lift the kettlebell safely, how to clean, swing, press, row, and all the basic movements which you need to perform a full body workout with the kettlebell. You will also understand how to warm up, cool down, work on mobility, transition, and even a bit of basic programming.\n\n\nOther course\nIf you've seen my other course on Udemy and are wondering what the difference is. My other highly rated kettlebell course From Zero to Kettlebell Superhero in 4 Weeks has more text and includes exam questions, whereas this course is more visual with completely optional assessments. This course is also much more detailed.\nCheck the Kettlebell Training PREMIUM course if you're after a course with kettlebell workouts, exams, certificate from Cavemantraining, and personal assessments.\n\n\nHope to see you soon.\nTaco Fleur from Cavemantraining\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation.

Crush jumping workouts, develop your coordination, agility, calf and forearm muscles!\nCourse delivered in the easy-to-digest form of short lessons, that can be practiced prior to your workout routine.\nTake this schooling to the gym. Warm up and play the lesson. Go through the exercises given in that session then move on to your routine. In no time you will see improvement in jumping. A better understanding of the rope will transfer to less energy spent and more fun gained with each WOD. Soon you will be a jump rope ninja!\nThe course is designed for any skill level. We start from the very beginning - how to warm up, spin and jump, and what equipment you need. Then we progress to exercises developing an understanding of the rope: hearing, feeling, seeing the cable and handles, and how that information will add to overall performance. Once the singles are in your book, we will define double under. Knowing how the movement should be performed will allow us to assess the current level and areas for improvement. From there cleaning the technique up will go smoothly. When the DU's are done in a consecutive way last step will be to do them \"unbroken\".\nIf you encounter any problems during schooling - send some vids and I'll direct you with personalized cues.\nAbout the instructor: I'm a technique perfectionist. I believe that every time we train we have the opportunity to perfect our technique - every single air squat is a chance to assess and improve the way we stand, generate tension, create rotation and so on... This philosophy allowed me to explore a great many ways to explain and excel at any given movement. Now I'm offering a piece of this knowledge to you.

      "description": "Hello!\n\nI can't wait to share with you some new break-thru findings that have helped 1000's of people alleviate their low back and neck pain, hip and groin pain and even buttock pain for good!\nIt is largely assumed that when our back hurt, we just need to have a therapist rub out that tight spot or our doctor give us a cortisone shot right into the painful area. That may even be helpful to a certain extent - but that is often not the real reason why we area in pain and therefore it is not the complete cure.\nWe can see this across all of medicine. There is a specialist for every body part. While that is great and useful, it also compartmentalized our bodies into little, disconnected sections. You go to physical therapy for your hip, you get stretches and strengthening exercises for your hip. You go to the orthopedic surgeon for your shoulder, you have a shoulder surgery done. Do these specialists ever investigate why these body parts got inflamed and painful in the first place?\nAs a yoga instructor, massage therapist and nutritional health coach I come across many clients with back pain issues. Most of my clients have tried numerous approaches to alleviate their pain. It sparked my interest when I noticed that often their pain couldn't get resolved by simply getting a massage or doing yoga poses. That finding inspired me to come up with a much more complex system that looks at the body as a sophisticated, highly interconnected machine. A machine that is very capable of healing itself when given the right tools...which makes this course you are about to take, a power-tool!\n\nSee, you can do all the back strengthening exercises and yoga poses you want - if the few key muscles in your body are not \"fine-tuned\" correctly so that they are encouraged to do the job they are meant to do, you will do any exercise and activity  with a misaligned, compromised body and  the results will be lousy and the pain may get even worse.\n\nI am not here to tell you about a new workout regimen.\n\nNo, I am here to introduce you to some little known, easy-to-do techniques that will quickly help unlock your nervous system and allow your body to release its hold on the muscles and nerves that contribute to back, hip, groin and buttock pain (you may also get rid of neck pain, arm pain and even foot issues as a side effect of working these methods).\nWhat you will learn in a moment are advanced and scientifically proven methods that will bring your body back to its most natural, advantageous and most of all, pain-free posture.\nThese methods are used by professionals like Osteopaths, Physical Therapists, Postural Restoration Clinics, and other health care professionals. This course is the place where you will find tid-bits of all these professional approaches in one place. Warning: as a side effect, you may stop some seemingly unrelated issues you have been having (check list of symptoms below).\n\nThe difference between regular back exercises and what you learn in this program is that here, you will work through your nervous system.  See, nerves govern the body's muscles. In other words, the nerves talk to the muscles and tell them how to behave, what length to be at and when to contract, etc. So then if you have a bunch of nerves that are restricted and locked in by the compression of muscles and other structures, the signals in those nerves get interrupted or even temporarily shut down.\nThe reason for that is that one or more key postural muscles are not working properly and therefore pull on your low back and push your abdominal organs forward, tug on your chest, your shoulder blades, etc.These tissues are either too tight or too weak. Problem is, most of these deep tissues you can't see like you can see a biceps muscle since they are embedded deep inside the body. Tight and restricted muscles pull unfavorably on nearby nerves and other structures and voila, there is the perfect recipe for pain and discomfort.\nIn addition to your back pain, you may have one or more of these symptoms:\nConstipation, maybe even chronic\nAppearance of a pot belly, protruding abdomen\nHip pain\nNeck and shoulder pain\nAppearance of flat back\nMenstrual issues\nDiscomfort, pain and aches in the front hip socket and groin\nRestriction in the hip socket.\nbursitis/tendinitis.\nRestriction moving the thigh backward.\nDeep pelvic pain, usually on one side. Can feel like menstrual pain.\nDeep ache in the belly\nTwisted pelvis\nDifficulty breathing\nHeadaches\nAcid Reflux\nThe best news is by working with this highly effective system you likely will get rid of issues listed above. So let's get ready to attack the problem at its source by working with these \"trouble maker\" muscles!\nI designed this course to give you the knowledge and the power to heal your pain and take charge of your own well-being. I am proud to be part of the new generation of lasting pain relief.\nIn a world full of information, it becomes clear that  YOU are your own best therapist and I thank you for taking a step toward feeling great again!\n\n\nWarmly,\n\n\nNicole",

      "description": "This course is a complete guide to building muscle and burning fat. It's NOT how much weight you lift, but rather it IS how you lift the weight that determines how much muscle you build. Did you know that there are certain exercises that specifically target a particular physique that you are trying to obtain? For example, you need to do a different type of biceps curl if you want your biceps muscles to have a high peak as opposed to just getting bigger. And if you want a wider back, then you need to do certain exercises that are different from those that will get you a thicker back. Those are just a couple examples. There are many more instances where different exercises for the same muscle will result in different types of growth for that particular muscle. And just as important are the techniques that you use when doing the exercises.\nIn this course, I explain in detail and physically show you how to do many different exercises that will result in various positive growth outcomes for your muscles. I also thoroughly explain and physically perform the different weight lifting techniques that will result in the fastest muscle growth, so you can achieve the physique that you've always wanted!\nIn this course, you will learn all of the weight lifting, cardio, and dieting secrets that will allow your body to gain the most amount of muscle and burn the most amount of fat in the shortest amount of time.  Whether you are brand new to exercise or a professional athlete, everyone will benefit from this course. If you want a muscular and lean body and you want it fast, then you need this course!",

      "description": "Somatic movement is a neuromuscular re-education technique which teaches you to release and relax your muscles so that you can regain proper muscle function again.  The movements are slow and gentle and promote sensory awareness to increase brain-muscle coordination.  The exercises are performed consciously with the intention of focusing on the internal experience of the movement rather than the external appearance and are very helpful in improving body awareness.\nThrough a method of slowly contracting, releasing, lengthening and relaxing a muscle or group of muscles, you will re-educate your body to move in an efficient and pain-free way.  Many of us struggle with various sports injuries and niggling health issues due to adaptive muscle shortening.   Muscles will change their functional resting length to adapt to the length at which they are habitually used or positioned which leads to muscle imbalances, injuries, joint degeneration and pain.\nBased on the original teachings of Thomas Hanna, these exercises can change unhelpful learned muscular patterns.  Some benefits of  somatic movement methods are:\n\n\nA reduction of chronic pain\nImprovement in bodily function\nRecovery from common musculoskeletal conditions\nIncreased flexibility and range of motion\nReduction in muscular tension and awareness of unhealthy postural habits\nHeightened body awareness and reduction in stress and anxiety\nSomatic movement is enormously beneficial for anyone:\n\n\nA perfect way to introduce yourself to exercise if you are new to fitness\nA useful tool to help improve the mind/body connection - beneficial for those who are already exercising in some way and want to improve their performance and focus\nThe ideal way to aid recovery from injury or illness, including providing a bridge back to regular fitness levels\nEffective in helping clients prepare for class or cooldown\nThe best choice for the aging client who is either finding regular exercise to be too aggressive/ineffective or the older client who is new to exercise\nSo what will you get on this course?\n\n\nManuals with information to introduce you to Somatic movement\n15 exercises to address every part of the body\nA warm up \"sensing\" routine and a deep relaxation routine\nThe entire 1 hour class\nShorter class lesson plans",

Out of these fifteen, three samples were of particular concern, as they tested high for levels of these toxic chemicals!!\n(Don’t worry, in [0-20] Nutrition Guide, I will give you the EXACT criteria’s you should look for when choosing a Supplement brand, if any!)\nSo LET me ask this question:\nWould you pay less than the cost of single month’s gym membership to get the body of your dream?",

Common ways to compromise the immune system are chronic stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, toxic air, and lack of movement.\nIn TCM, the strength of your immune system depends on your vitality and life force energy, called Qi. People with high vitality have a strong immune system and better response to viral infection. Qigong is a selfcare practice designed to enhance your vitality Qi and effectively boost your immune system. There are three basic ways to keep the immune system strong which I call the three B’s: Balanced Digestion, Balanced Hormones and Balanced Emotions.\nThis easy to follow series contains a selection of routines that focus on this balance. The two core lessons are the Immune System SUPPORT Flow and Immune System DEFENSE Flow. Both lessons include techniques for emotional balance, creating coherence between your body, mind, and spirit. There are also two bonus lessons to strengthen your wei qi (guardian energy) called Body Patting and Embrace the Tree. Marisa Cranfill has hundreds more qigong flow programs on many topics and for specific ailments.

It involves a series of repetitive movements using wood tools and my hands.\n\n\nThis technique redefines body contours, manipulates targeted areas of muscle, fat and cellulite. I incorporate lymphatic drainage to rid the body of stored toxins which kickstarts the metabolism to burn fat.\n\n\nThis manipulation also breaks down stubborn cellulite, shrinking unwanted bulges and smoothing out orange peel dimples. A journey to the giving the client the curves they have always wanted and maintain a firm toned body both post operatively and non operatively.\n\n\nI have trained extensively from USA, Colombia and Spain in both Wood therapy and lymphatic drainage.\n\n\n\n\nFat (Adiposity) is those deposits of accumulation of fat in a particular area of the body which causes volume increase in both men  and women. Maderotarapia       ( wood therapy) is ideal to break down fat cells.\n\n\nTrained therapists use a series of repetitive deep pressure movements with special wood tools that lead to rapid break down of fatty tissue and cellulite.\n\n\nPressure causes rapture of fat cells membrane thereby releasing  its fat content, converting it into a substance easy to eliminate through the sweat gland and lymphatic system which eventually eliminate through urine.",

The exercises evolve naturally in difficulty. Timely and clear cues.\" 5* review from Katarina, a student\nYou should practice each class until you feel comfortable to move on.  The sequence should be repeated at least 10 times, every other day.  You will then be ready to move on to the next level.\nIt is possible to complete this course within 3 months for the fit and injury free; 5 to 6 months is achievable for most people.\n\"With her gentle voice, clear instructions and perfect pacing, Josie takes us through beginner, intermediate and advanced lessons. Her prompts and self-check reminders seem to come exactly when needed. There are ample opportunities to practice and progress at each level, and will benefit all ages and body types.\" 5* review from Susan Pav\n\"In 10 sessions you will feel the difference.

So, I know exactly the type of information you can find in sports video courses, and that's why my course is on a higher level.\n\n\nWhat Will You Find Inside The Course?\n\n\nIntroduction Phase, where I will talk to you about the role of a personal trainer, the evolution of the fitness world, and the basic physiology of muscles.\nMuscle Growth Fundamentals, a phase where I will explain the truth about muscle growth and the mistakes to avoid.\nClient Assessment, a section dedicated to interviewing your clients and implementing important physical tests.\nWorkout Design, a part of the course that teaches you how to create the best training program for your client.\nSample Workouts, a section that includes practical workout routines ideal for different goals.\nFitness Diet, a dedicated part about nutrition that covers the best dietary plan in the world.\nSupplements, the final part of the course dedicated to dietary supplementation to maximize your physique.\nBefore saying goodbye, I want to give you a piece of advice as a true friend. Of course, I hope you will purchase my video course because I believe in the excellent service I am offering you. However, if you decide to purchase another video course, don't worry, we will still be friends. But the most important thing of all is not to wait too long to make your decision. I know that participating in a course is not easy and requires commitment, which is why many people overthink and end up missing the opportunity to improve themselves.\nI genuinely want you to seize this opportunity to take this step in studying and bettering yourself because the world of fitness needs true professionals who care for people. I know that studying and staying up-to-date requires discipline, but it is the only path to success in life. I have been studying every day for many years now. When I have more time, it's 1-2 hours, and when I have less time, even just 10-15 minutes. But every day, I study something to improve myself, and this preparation makes a difference when working with my clients.\nSo, I also invite you to study every day and feel better each time you open your eyes in the morning.\nIn life, everyone must choose one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.",

      "description": "Welcome, and congratulations on taking the first step towards a healthier, stronger you with my Complete Pilates Mat Course!\nI’m thrilled that you’re here, ready to embark on this journey. This course is designed for individuals of all ages and fitness levels, helping you understand the core principles of Pilates and practice it easily, anywhere. Pilates is for \"every body\", regardless of your age or fitness background, and I invite you to consider your investment in your body just as you would with anything else in life. By committing to this course, you’re making an invaluable investment in your future.\nWhat sets this course apart is its attention to detail and depth of coverage. You will learn how to perform Pilates exercises correctly while maximizing the benefits of each movement. At the start, we’ll cover the theory behind Pilates, and then we’ll dive into the classical Pilates exercises. By the end, you’ll not only understand how to do each exercise, but also the purpose of it. After each level, you’ll be guided through a full 1-hour workout, helping you to put everything into practice.\nI’ll also empower you to create your own Pilates mat workout, providing you with practical guidelines to customize your routine at the end of the course.\nThroughout this journey, you won’t just be mimicking exercises – you’ll be learning the proper techniques to ensure you’re performing Pilates with precision, avoiding bad habits, and truly benefiting from each movement.\nWhat can you expect at the end of this course?\nImproved posture\nIncreased flexibility\nStronger core strength\nEnhanced mobility in your shoulders, hips, arms, legs, and spine\nGreater body awareness\nImproved performance in other sports and activities\nEnhanced ability to perform daily tasks\nA reduced risk of injuries\nBoosted self-confidence\nWe all lead busy lives and often neglect the very bodies that carry us through each day. The Pilates method you’ll learn in this course is a powerful investment in your body’s long-term health. It strengthens the core – the foundation of a healthy life – by focusing on the tiny muscles surrounding your spine and working outward. Pilates ensures all of your muscles are balanced and equally engaged, maintaining your body’s strength and shape over time.\nAs Joseph Pilates famously said:\n“Pilates is the complete coordination of body, mind, and spirit.”\n“In 10 sessions, you’ll feel the difference. In 20 sessions, you’ll see the difference. In 30 sessions, you’ll have a whole new body.”\n– Joseph Pilates",

Since then I have sold and serviced millions of dollars and thousands upon thousands of hours worth of personal training sessions. With every type of client you can imagine.\nPrior to that, I was a natural, drug-free bodybuilder for 13 years.\nI've taken my 3 decades of experience training myself and hundreds of clients and developed a system--the Slow Go System--that can be adapted to suit your individual needs.\nI see so many people with the will and putting in the effort, but how they are working out is all wrong. I want to help all these people, the ones who consistently go to the gym but have been unable to get the results they desire. My system is for you.\nBefore this course, this game-changing information was only available to four-figure paying online clients and clients I train personally at my gym, The Transformation Station, for over $100/hour.\nBut I wanted to create something teaching the Slow Go System that every person could afford. That's why me and my team put together this course. It shows you how to work out to build muscle and burn fat as quickly as possible in a simple, hopefully entertaining, way.\nThe Slow Go System has worked for many people just like you. I'm so confident in this that I give a 100% money-back guarantee; if you don't feel you had a 5-star experience, we'll work to get you there, or refund your cash no questions asked.\nI've made it as easy as possible for you to learn a system, built on 3 decades of experience, that can totally change your life.\nI hope you allow me to share this amazing system with you and help you take yourself to the next level by investing in Weight Lifting Essentials today.",

It takes a ton of diligence with your diet, it takes a lot of courage to start exercising, and it's a really intimidating process to start. You may see some consistent results in the first 4-8 weeks with cutting calories and exercise, but then you hit that plateau, and either stop losing weight or even gain a few pounds overnight!\n\"What's the deal?! If you cut calories and start working out, the weight should just be coming off, right?\"\n\nThat statement is totally true, it should be a relatively straightforward process, and for the most part it is.\nEating a calorie deficit + Exercise = Fat Loss\nSo if that's the case, why isn't everyone ripped?\nLosing body fat can be one of the hardest things that you do, but it doesn't have to be that complicated. Most of being successful at fat loss is\nSimplifying the process as much as possible\nCreating the ideal environment for creating healthy habits, and eliminating unhealthy choices.\nWhy Popular Diets and Exercise Programs Don't Work\nThey ask too much. They give you 12 new habits that you need to start using immediately, 100 new recipes you need to learn, and a 6-7 day/week INTENSE workout program that pushes your body to the brink of injury.\nThey may have some great looking testimonials from the few people who succeeded, but they are in the 2% who actually stick with the program beyoned the first 60-90 days.\nWhy does everyone else quit?\nThese flashy programs just ask too much. When you throw enough changes into your life in any regard, it gets overwhelming and you will be more likely to quit. Every person is geared that way.\n\nWhy this Program is Different\nThis fat loss program totally simplifies the process of fat loss. It is a bare-bones, super effective program that you can follow anywhere. It gives you a 360 degree education on your body, your body type, how you use and process energy, and how to manipulate your diet and energy systems to minimize the time you spend on losing fat, while maximizing your results.\n\nHere's what you are getting in this course\n-How and what you need to eat to melt stubborn belly fat\n-The foods that have been making you fat and preventing you from losing weight\n-A custom diet plan based on your body type, current weight, and your goals.\n-How to manipulate your body's energy systems to burn more fat during your workout.\n-How to increase your resting metabolism for up to 30 hours AFTER your workout is over.\n-How to workout for about 1 hour per WEEK, and get better results than people who workout for an hour per DAY.\n-A complete 4 day per week home workout program with video tutorials and workouts. No gym necessary. No equipment required.\n-A four week workout schedule that you can use 12 months a year.\n- Hundreds of dollars worth of free information, services, and discounted bonus material at the end of this program.\nWhat's the risk?\nVirtually none. If you are unhappy with this super-simple and sustainable fat loss program, you can get a 100% refund within 30 days of purchase.\nWhy waste any more time on thinking about starting, when you can get started with the easiest-to-follow fat loss program right now?\nDon't put your body or your health off for another second.

She actually does 4 sets of the 4 quadplexes, but honestly that's too much for most athletes. BUT I also think it is useful to see what advanced training is really like, as so few programs actually show you. You should have something to \"work towards.\" Yes, there is a difference between how the really successful copmetitors train, and how other people do. Training is about pushing yourself, and that's why I've shown an advanced program, but with info on \"how to get there.\"\nThis is the kind of metabolic training I often assign figure athletes and women getting ready to step on stage in a figure or bikini competition. As you'll see, there is no need for cardio on top of this program (especially once you see Day 5!).

The principles are the same. The safety aspect is the same. The lighting and overall delivery may look a bit dated.\nThis is a FREE course where the content is what is key. For each of the four sections, mistakes in exercising are shown and the REASON behind the mistakes, is analysed. You have probably been exercising wrongly for years - these lectures go through why these mistakes are dangerous.\nThis is a short course and is simply to emphasise the overriding need to exercise safely.

A large percentage of kettlebell beginners quit simply because of the banging, bruising, blisters, and lower back pain.\nThis course will explain in detail how to prevent all these issues. It might be the most boring course on the planet about kettlebells, because after all, who doesn't want to just get started with working out? But it's the most important course on the planet about kettlebells, so do yourself a favor and start with this course.\nYour first objective in kettlebell training is to be knowledgeable to the point where you know how to prevent injuries.\nYour second objective is to be able to analyze, identify, and correct any mistakes you’ve made that caused an injury.\nThis course will get straight to the point on the subject of injury prevention with kettlebell training. No fluff, over two decades of knowledge that will help anyone to prevent injury and train safely with kettlebells.\n\n\nThis course consists of text, illustrations, exams, videos, and photos. There is a lot of text, but you can skip the text if you like, and just watch the videos. You can request a free digital PDF of the whole course (without the exam content) after purchase so that you can have it handy at any time. The course also includes a one and half hour kettlebell workout video that has everything you need to complete that workout. That video is broken down into technique, warm-up, follow-along workout, cooldown, and more.\n\nThe kettlebell can be a cause for injury when you don’t invest the time into it. But more importantly, on the flip-side, if you invest the time and money in it then the kettlebell will help prevent injury, not only during training but also in everyday life. Kettlebell training will provide you with a plentitude of other benefits. Benefits that include but are not limited to:\nStrength\nCardiovascular endurance\nPower\nMuscular endurance\nFlexibility\nAgility\nMental toughness\n\nAnd so much more.\n\nThe stronger, flexible, agile, powerful, and tougher you are, the more injury-proof you become.\nWithout a doubt, kettlebell training will help you to become more injury-proof, but only when done right! If it’s done right, then you run the risk of experiencing some of the following common kettlebell injuries and annoyances:\nBruising\nBanging\nBlisters\nBack pain\nCalluses\nTendonitis\nTendinosus\nOvertraining\nAnd other joint, muscle, or tendon issues.",

Nothing gets more frustrating but to have all this knowledge and not know how to get people to listen to me! After taking this FitGolf Golf Fitness Business Building course I felt the weight of the world fall off my shoulders. It's so simple, yet so powerful. You will not regret it - worth every dime!\nRita Danelian - Encino, CA\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\"I would like to provide you with some positive feedback about the client-generation techniques I learned in FitGolf’s \"Getting Clients in The Door\" course.\n\nLast weekend I provided 5-minute stretches to a local public golf course before the start of one of their annual member tournaments. Due to logistics, I was able to provide stretching for only 45 minutes. However, the event was a great success for me. In fact, I hadn't even secured my company banner on the tent when a member saw it and said \"Oh, you're a lifesaver! My back is so stiff!\"\n\nThe idea of the stretch tent alone is a simple, yet brilliant marketing idea...especially if the clinician sticks to the script. I made sure to follow the script for each interaction. The greatest difficulty I had was keeping a straight face. As I asked questions, people responded exactly how you said they would. Sticking to the script made it easy and painless for me and allowed me to relax and enjoy myself.\n\nI provided stretches to 8 players, 3 of whom have become clients! If each of those clients comes in for 6 or more visits, that will generate at least $2500 in revenue...which is many times more than the cost of the course. That is the most direct and clear return on investment I have received from any course, ever. Thanks!\n\nP.S. - the Pro invited me to play in the tournament as his guest after I was done with the tent!\"\nMichael G., PT - Rockland, ME\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\"Thank you so much for this fantastic informative and inspiring course “Get clients in the door”. I think the model you and your team have put together will help all attendees improve their golf fitness business and help us all make more money.\"\nAndy G. - Director of Golf Performance  Sant Cugat Del Valles, Barcelona\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n“What a fantastic hands-on approach to making marketing easy. Definitely, all the tools anyone would need to build a business. Very adaptable to different situations and circumstances. I feel like I can go home and immediately put to use the knowledge and advice that has been given to me. Highly recommend this course for any golf fitness instructor.”\nKristen Shollack\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n“The use of the “buddy system” has been very beneficial to our center and implementing the system is extremely easy. Clients that walk through your doors have confided in you and a warm rapport should be established from day one. Asking for “help” from these clients is not forced and oftentimes clients are jazzed to help bring friends or family in to experience the program. The system when put into place creates a massive marketing web since your clients are your marketing team! This system has proved to be an invaluable part of our center here in Honolulu.”                    Bryce A., Honolulu, HI\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n“This course helped me to get over some of my fears of the sales and marketing aspect of my business.

The best intentions only get you so far but having expert guidance and a well-designed program will remove all the obstacles to success. Forever Flexible is the last stretching program you will ever need to buy. It delivers lasting results and even after a long break you can return to the exercises and techniques and they will still serve you years into the future.\nWhether you are an athlete who wants to prevent injury, enhance performance and improve muscle recovery or you're someone who has been getting stiffer and tighter over the years and wants to reverse the signs of aging and regain the freedom of movement of your youth, this program will exceed your expectations.",

Are you struggling with weight loss or engaging in physical activity in general? Do you need a spark of motivation to help you kick your fitness lifestyle into drive; or maybe you are ready to start working out for the first time but do not know where to start, what to do or how to do it.\nThis course is designed especially for you. I know exactly how you feel and understand your lack of motivation because I struggled with the same issues for a very long time myself. I am a certified personal trainer that spent 17 years exercising and fighting with stubborn body fat that I could not seem to keep off for good. My weight was up and down year after year as I dealt with stressful events as well as the good times life seems to offer each of us. You see, I love to workout; no really, I eat, sleep and dream fitness. Working out is a hobby and I do it without batting an eye. It's the hardest part of living healthy that I just would not comply with; my nutrition. But a lot of my failures were not only due to my defiance to eat healthy (using my workouts as an excuse to eat crappy) but mostly due to lack of knowledge. When I decided to read more about why I could not keep my weight down after losing it so many times, I decided enough was enough and it was time that I stop the self-sabotage and give it 100% dedication like I have given with exercise. All the hard work has finally paid off and now, I love teaching and training people like you every thing I've learned and enjoyed over the last 20 years. So come on in to this course and allow me to do what I love to do; spark your motivation plug with custom innovative and effective workout regimens as well as nutrition education for your maximum weight loss in only 6 weeks!\n\nOur bodies are the only place we have to live for our entire lives so its imperative that we take care of it daily from the inside out.  In this course you will learn about the important fundamentals needed to start and succeed on your new journey to live a healthy lifestyle. I don't want you to spend another day, month or year like I did for 17 years; so to help you stay focused and informed, with this course I am including a free copy of my eBook, Shed Fat, Keep It Off. In this book, you will learn:\nHow to start with a positive Mindset\nEvery step to get self-motivated NOW and lose weight FAST\nHow you will lose over 20lbs in 45 days when you follow this program\nSelf-Motivation & Consistency\nHow to shop for and recognize healthy foods\nNutrition guidance & manual\nStay Prepared\nFinally making the commitment to change your life and your body\nYou give me 100% effort and I'll give you 200% motivation, support and resources to help you along you journey and to remain dedicated to reach higher fitness goals long after you've finished this course. Not only will you lose weight and have increased energy levels, but you will have an increase in confidence and self-motivation as you tranform your body, mind and way of life.\nSay goodbye to your struggles with:\n\n⦁ Weight loss\n⦁ Motivation\n⦁ Nutrition Confusion\n⦁ Stubborn Belly, back, arm fat\n⦁ Hitting a Plateau and trying to get out of it\n⦁ Low Confidence and/or low self esteem\n⦁ Lack of Drive\n⦁ Long boring workouts and exercise confusion\n⦁ Muffin Top\n⦁ Unmanagable weight control\n\nI look forward to seeing you in the course.

Injury-proof yourself.\n\n\nSome of the exercises in the CAVEMANROM suite of exercises, but not limited to, are:\n90/90 kettlebell windmill\nKings combo\nKettlebell seesaw press\nKettlebell Sots press\nKettlebell folding windmill\nKettlebell bent press\nKettlebell windmill\nKettlebell shinbox getup\nKettlebell Turkish getup (lunge style)\nKettlebell Turkish getup (squat style)\nKettlebell anyhow windmill\nKettlebell halo\nKettlebell kneeling windmill\nKettlebell kneeling bent press\nDouble kettlebell getup\nKettlebell overhead reverse lunge\nKettlebell spiral press\nKettlebell pull-over into scap opener\nKettlebell ribbon reverse lunge and twist\nKettlebell squat dead curl\nAnd many more.\n\n\nCAVEMANROM is for athletes, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA fighters, Crossfitters, Kettlebell enthusiasts, and everyday people. It is for everyone that wants to move better, function better, feel better.\n\n\nThe natural progression in CAVEMANROM is mastering the bodyweight movement first, then add a light load to force more stability and increase ROM under load. The load is light and appropriate. Nothing in CAVEMANROM is about speed, reps, weight, or setting a time. Everything in CAVEMANROM is about improving, injury-proofing, increasing range of motion, and increasing all aspects of mobility.\n\n\n“We all age. But ‘getting old’ is a choice.\nYour choice, get physically and mentally old or not. Put in the work or not.”\n\n\nYou'll be able to download a 200+ page PDF with all the content from the course as well, which makes it easier to read everything in one place. So, whether you go through each lesson and read the material online or download the PDF, read it, and then watch all the videos online, your choice. I just want to make it as easy as possible for you.\nYou'll also have access to a real person, me, I'm available to answer any questions that you might have. This is not just a sign up read the content and move on course, I have a passion to help and assist those that are interested.\nMost lessons will have a video to watch, whether within the course or external, this allows you to decide whether you read all the lesson material and watch the execution of the exercise, or just jump right into it and only watch the video.\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation. These courses are not the same as the ones offered on our website.

Let me be honest: If you need a body like me, then you need to hit the weights!\nBut, if your desire is to lose weight (and lot's of it), tone up, shape up and get super-fit, this course is for you.\nHere are the benefits that will accrue to you when you complete this 4-week program in a manner I recommend, then:\n- You'll be able to lose 2 lbs of fat per week (8 lbs in total). Weight loss will be more as there will be some water weight too!\n- You'll get super-fit\n-You'll work your fast twitch and very fast twitch muscle fibres which otherwise don't get worked when you are simply doing cardio\n-As a result, your body will release a lot of human growth hormone which helps boost testosterone. All this will help you build muscle faster and also make you look younger:)\n(HGH is also called the 'Fountain of Youth')\n-You'll SAVE a lot of time. No gym means no traffic!\n-You'll SAVE a ton of money. I will be your personal trainer in each video, motivating, guiding you throughout.\nThe videos are follow-along. All you need to do is simply follow me along and keep your ear open to the tips and suggestions I keep giving while working out, and you'll be fine!\nI'll also immediately reply to any doubts or queries.\nLot of money saved on Personal coaching\nMoney saved by not joining a gym\nYou get the point.\nHere are the Features and Bonuses you will get with this course:\n-ALL Body Weight and HIIT Workout Video's neatly divided into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced Levels.\n- 5 Types of Workout Videos for each level:\nFull Body Workout\nCardio Conditioning,\nLower Body Workout\nPlanks Variation Workout\nUpper/Side/Lower Abs Workout\n-Workout Calendar for 4 weeks. Which workouts to do when. All explained\nWhat this course is NOT:\n-Collection of you-tube videos and calling it a course! Instead, every exercise/movement has been given an intensity level and have been carefully combined with other movements based on the given trainee's fitness levels and the type of workout video.\nFor example: Knee Pushup are great for beginners and most of them are not able to do standard pushups. Whereas an advanced trainee can easily do diamond pushups which is super-tough to do!\nAt the same time, a detailed table is provided for people of all levels and 'what workout video to do when' in what combinations, on what days is explained clearly.\nBonus Videos & Resources:\n50+ Page Nutrition Guide (including 40+ recipes) to make the most out of this program\n21-Day Vegetarian Diet Plan\n21-Day Non Vegetarian Diet Plan\nFlexibility Training-Static Stretches covering your entire body!",

Previously she was athlete who experienced a debilitating injury whilst training extensively as a Long-Jumper.\nFleur had an accident while training and ended up with a spinal stress fracture in her lower back. This led to severe pain and 12 months of rehabilitation and treatment. During this time she learnt how to manage her own back pain through Pilates, posture, treatment and careful exercise. It was a long journey but it led to Fleur jumping a personal best of 6.30m several years later, and many years of competing at State and National level in Australia.\nFleur will guide you through the process she used to recover and manage her own back pain, as well as what she gives her patients when they are coming back from injury and wanting long lasting relief from back pain. It is safe and manageable for every level. Fleur believes that it's about training smarter as you age, not harder.\nGENUINE UDEMY COURSE REVIEWS:\n\"I've had back pain for more than 2 yrs.

Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way.\nRegular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems to avoid falls.\nThis course will be perfect at the beginning of your stretching journey as well as a source of weekly and even daily exercises to maintain your body in great fitness shape, increase your range of motion, and master hard poses like splits, bridges, etc.\nThis course includes 3 hour-long training sessions for front splits, middle splits, backbends, and shoulder stretching. Every session starts with a warm-up, followed by exercises for increasing range of motion, muscle strength training, balance exercises, and a cool-down at the end.\nGentle warm-up before starting the main workout part will help gradually rev up your cardiovascular system by raising your body temperature and increasing blood flow to your muscles.\nThe main workout part will increase the flexibility, mobility, and resilience of your body through both active stretches and static holds. The intensity of the stretches in this series can be adjusted according to your level, ranging from moderate to intermediate.\nCool-down exercises at the end of your workout will help you to ease yourself out of strenuous activity. Cool-down exercises and stretches lower your chance of injury, promote blood flow, and reduce stress on your heart and other muscles.",

Proven by many of my clients as a certified Osteopath and Physiotherapist. Athletes, artists and musicians as well as beginner and rehabilitation patients, children or pensioners, they all like the fun and no pressure philosophy in it. Every lecture has its progressions to learn along your ability of fitness, before it gets you to the next level.\nI came up with this Programme as someone very smart asked me: \"How often do you bring your hands on the ground a day? Isn't it something you did a lot when you were a child and you did not struggle with back pain or knee and shoulder problems? Have you ever tried to come back to that point of freedom in movement?\" And very quick I found myself back into a Topic, I heard a lot in my Sport- & Physio education ... it was: \"Use it, or lose it\".\nSo, this Course will show, how primal pattern could improve your skills and abilities for your daily activities and also your sport and advanced training.\nThe sequence goes from a warm up selection, basic positions, walking routines and special moves to the bonus part and an outlook for much more variety.\nPlease notice - the training in closed kinetic chains, like this course will provide, is very safe and nearly free of risk because of the low momentum, birth given reflexes and the high focus on quality of movements with a part of your bodyweight. But as a profession in the german health system I really wanna care and have to mention, that I could not know about you and your constitution. Its you ... and if you feel unsure e.g. about the load-bearing capacity of your arms, legs or spine ... please stay safe and talk in advance to your doctor or physician for advice.\nNow, I hope you are curious enough to take the journey ... and get your \"Four to the Floor\" :)\nEnjoy your time and your body,\nBest regards\nRalf",

Soft qìgōng movements use a large range of motion with minimal muscular tension coordinated with deep, relaxed breathing. Practice will energize the entire body and prevent many common injuries and ailments, such as joint pain in the hands, arms, shoulders and back.\n\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Dr. Yang started his kung fu training with Shaolin White Crane (Bai He) Master Cheng, Gin-Gsao (曾金灶). In thirteen years of study (1961-1974) under Master Cheng, he became an expert in the White Crane style of Chinese martial arts, which includes soft and hard methods of qìgōng, and a full kung fu curriculum.\n\n\nIn this program, Master Yang teaches you Soft Qìgōng fundamentals, including\nPowerful whole-body strengthening movements\nStationary, rocking, and stepping qìgōng methods\nVital keypoints for correct practice and better health\nA stimulating soft qìgōng exercise sequence\n\n\nThis beginner-friendly class progresses into deeper points, including how to lead more qì through the whole body with Grand Circulation. Master Yang encourages you through a fun and inspiring workout with the goal of establishing your ongoing qìgōng practice.

      "description": "Are you 18yrs and over and want to get fitter, tone up, shape up, lose weight, increase your stamina and strength, balance your hormones, make better nutritional choices? Do you need to do exercise from home? Do you need to have a complimentary exercise regime to your existing one? Do you want short workouts of 30 minute duration which still produce results? Do you like the idea of HIIT or Rest Based High Intensity Interval Training? Do you want a programme with a lifetime access which is progressive and taylored to your body without needing a functional nutritionist? Are you fed up of struggling with food? Have you gone on all sorts of diets which worked for a bit but then backfired? Do you want to educate yourself on the hormones which play a role on body weight/ shape? Do you want to have a nutritional guide which helps you eat cleaner but is not a diet and its not about cutting out completely? Do you want to step it up in terms of nutrition without needing a functional nutritionist who costs lots and needs to do blood tests? Are you fed up of being unhappy with your body shape? Do you want to have a programme that is affordable yet extremely effective if used? Do you want to contribute to changing lives in Uganda (10% of the money goes to Whisper The Worlds Orphanage Fund)?\nIf you have answered yes to 1 or more of the above then this course is for you!\nThere are 2 main components and the 3rd component which is on mindset is a bonus component.\nThe Rest Based HIIT component is your exercise and there are 4 sets of exercises. We recommend at least 2 weeks per set but it is up to you how you progress through it. There are videos for each exercise, there is a warm up section and there is a breakdown of stretches recommended. There are explanatory intro videos on how to carry out the session exactly.\nThe nutritional guide is a gem and instead of keeping it for the select few, we have decided we wanted to make a bigger impact and so we are releasing it through this course! You will analyse your hormone profile through a simple questionnaire and then follow the plan guide thats best for your body based on your total score. There are explanatory videos on this too and the rest is on pdfs you can keep. This is incredible as its one step up from the generic nutritional guides out there and one step down from having to have blood tests with a functional nutritionist which is costly.\nThe mindset section is a bonus as it a a big passion of mine too. There is a chance more clips will be added on there for you but its a small section to get you started! 80% of success comes from the correct psychology!\n\nMyself (Des) and Nicola hope you get great value out of this. That you enjoy it. That you make the most of it.\nWhat is life without our health?\nSee you on the course!\nDes",
      "target_audience": [
        "This is for you if you want to shape up and if you have been struggling with your nutrition. You should be fit and well to carry out the HIIT part. The nutrition component can be used by itself if need be, so if you want to take a better control of your hormones without having to do blood tests with a functional nutritionist then this is great for you. The exercise component is not for you if you have big injuries or need personal guidance for exercise and the nutrition component is not for you if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that need specialist supervision."

      "description": "In this courses, I will show you through breath control exercise and Tai Chi Skill to regain the peace of mind.   Tai Chi Chen Style 38 Forms  (陈式38式太极拳) combines the most of the postures from Chen Style Traditional 74 Forms, cut repeating movements.  Comparing with Basic Tai Chi Chen Style 22 Forms and the commonly seen Tai Chi Yang Style,  Tai Chi Chen Style 38 Forms keep the kicking, jumping and leaping movements which will apply in fighting. This is good for Intermediate Tai Chi, to keep mental and physical fitness, to achieve mindfulness and relaxation. It can be used for sweating workout.\nTai Chi or Shadow Boxing, another school of Kungfu in Chinese martial art culture, was born in Henan Province, 70km north to David Yao's native place.\nTai chi, short for T'ai chi ch'üan or Tàijí quán  (Chinese: 太极拳，太極拳; pinyin: Tàijí quán), is a traditional Chinese martial art which combines mind and awareness of our body, the deep diaphragmatic breathing and Qi, the inherent vital energy, through graceful movements to achieve mindfulness and relaxation. Tai chi is practiced for both its defense training, its health benefits and meditation.\nQigong, qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功 qìgōng literally: \"Life Energy Cultivation\") is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used in belief it promotes health, spirituality, and martial arts training. Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind.  Qigong can be viewed as a medicinal movement practice, combining breath work, relaxation, movement and self-massage all in one.\n\n\nTai Chi Strengthens Mind and Body\nTai Chi’s focus on posture and body placement may add benefits beyond what cardiovascular or resistance-training can provide.\nTai Chi, a moving Yoga, does more than burn calories and tone muscles. It will enable you to gain flexibility and strength, reducing stress and allowing for greater relaxation. It's a total mind-body workout that combines strengthening and stretching poses with deep breathing and meditation or relaxation.\nThe health benefits of tai chi\nThis gentle form of exercise can help maintain strength, flexibility, and balance, and could be the perfect activity for the rest of your life.\nTai chi is often described as \"meditation in motion, moving Yoga,\"  which originated in China as a martial art.  The Chen Style Tai chi is the oldest and parent form of the five traditional family styles of Tai chi. Chen-style is characterized by Silk reeling, alternating fast/slow motion and bursts of power.  The Chen Style is Originated in Hen Nan Chen Jia Gou, 70 KM at north of David Yao's birth place.\nThere is growing evidence that this mind-body practice, has value in treating or preventing many health problems. And you can get started even if you aren't in top shape or the best of health.  In this low-impact, slow-motion exercise, you go without pausing through a series of motions.  As you move, you breathe deeply and naturally, focusing your attention — as in some kinds of meditation — on your bodily sensations. Tai chi differs from other types of exercise in several respects. The movements are usually circular and never forced, the muscles are relaxed rather than tensed, the joints are not fully extended or bent, and connective tissues are not stretched. Tai chi can be easily adapted for anyone, from the most fit to people confined to wheelchairs or recovering from surgery.\n\n\nMedical Disclaimer\nAll content found on thetaichifitness dot org, edeo dot biz,, our courses in Udemy platform and YouTube etc. related websites, social media, including: text, images, audio, or other formats were created for informational purposes only.  The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

        "This is a course for people who want to learn how to self-treat their non-specific lower back pain doing physical therapy exercises. My name is Mathias Van Den Broeck, I achieved my master’s degree in physical therapy at the Belgian University of Leuven and afterwards I also achieved my master’s degree in osteopathy at Buckinghamshire New University. As a physical therapist I’ve worked with many patients suffering from lower back pain. And exercise therapy is the key to long-term success. The course is build up in a 10 step protocol going from easy to difficult exercises. The steps build up from mobility exercises combined with basic stability exercises. As the steps progress, the exercises will increase the difficulty in stability and also strength will be added to it. You can choose your own pace in the rehabilitation protocol. You start with step 1 and then progress to the next step, if only you feel that the step became too easy for you. So if only you don’t get any muscle soreness, articular pain or any other type of discomfort doing the exercises from that step, you can progress to the next step. Some people might get from step 1 to step 10 in 10 weeks, others will progress a little slower and might, for example, take half a year to progress to step 10. For most people the back pain should already be gone when step 8 is reached, they might prefer to stop in an earlier step. This is possible of course, but the actual target is to fulfill step 10 with ease.",
        "This course is made for people who suffer from non-specific lower back pain. If any neurological or structural problems are present, it is advised to first consult a healthcare provider. If step 1 gives any discomfort already from the beginning on, it is also advised to first consult a doctor, osteopath, manual therapist or chiropractor before going on with the exercises. So that any articular problems are already solved before training on them. The exercises are at your own risk, so be careful not to progress to fast and if any problems are present it might be better to consult a healthcare provider. To prevent accidents during the exercises it is advised to ask someone to stay close to you while doing difficult exercises for the first time. I can’t promise you no accidents will happen, because I don’t have any control on how you are performing at home and I’m not up to date about your specific medical history. You also have to be careful not to go too fast. If only the exercises go without any difficulty, you can progress to the next step. Except for step number 2, this one you always have to do for two weeks. As I can’t see if you are doing a good job performing these exercises, it is advised to work with a mirror or let someone check your performance while doing them. Even though I had to mention the safety issues, this course is an ideal way for most people suffering from lower back pain. Not every back problem can be fixed with these exercises, but a lot of the can. It is well-known in the medical world that exercise therapy is an excellent way to get rid of back pain. The most important thing that I ask you guys is to be driven doing these exercises and you might be surprised of what your body is capable off.",
        "A basic motor control is an advantage in this course. The only things you need to fulfill this course is an exercise mat, 2 small towels, a mini band, an elastic band, a tennis ball, an exercise band, a soccer ball (or basketball or volleyball), a stick and a foam roller (or water bottle)."

You will also understand how to warm up, cool down, work on mobility, transition, and even a bit of basic programming.\n\n\nDay 1 Warming up and priming for kettlebell training\nDay 2 Stretching and mobility for kettlebell training\nDay 3 Kettlebell anatomy and grip\nDay 4 Safely lifting the kettlebell with a squat\nDay 5 Safely lifting the kettlebell with a hip hinge\nDay 6 Assisted kettlebell clean\nDay 7 Kettlebell squat swing\nDay 8 Kettlebell hip hinge swing\nDay 9 Kettlebell pendulum swing\nDay 10 Double arm swing clean\nDay 11 Kettlebell dead clean\nDay 12 Swing clean\nDay 13 Kettlebell racking\nDay 14 Kettlebell pressing\nDay 15 Kettlebell rowing\nDay 16 Kettlebell American swing\nDay 17 Double kettlebell dead swing clean\nDay 18 Recap and additional kettlebell tips\nDay 19 Kettlebell programming and goals\nDay 20 Kettlebell workout\nDay 21 Common kettlebell injuries and annoyances\n\n\nOther courses\nIf you've seen my other course on Udemy and are wondering what the difference is.\nMy other highly rated kettlebell course From Zero to Kettlebell Superhero in 4 Weeks has more text and includes exam questions, whereas this course is more visual, has required assessments, and comes with a book.\n\n\nHope to see you soon.\nTaco Fleur from Cavemantraining\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation.

Instead I will show you the exact training methods that are scientifically proven to work.\nHere is what's inside the program:\nPart 1: Introduction\nPart 2: How To Build Muscle & Lose Fat The Scientific Way\nThe Step-By-Step Muscle Building Formula\nThe Step-By-Step Fat Loss Formula\nThe Best Supplements For Beginners\nHow To Create A Bulking Diet\nHow To Create A Cutting Diet\nPart 3: Workout Program\nThe Full Workout Plan\nHow To Progress And See Results\nHow To Warm Up Correctly\nHow Much Cardio Do You Really Need?\nExercise Videos To Help You Train With Perfect Form\nEctomorph Muscle Building\nWhat About Abs? How To Get Six-Pack Abs Without Much Effort\nPart 4: Motivation & Goal Setting\nSetting SMART Fitness Goals\nMore Tips On How To Stay Motivated\nI also included 2 BONUSES for my students. Along with the program you also get my 100 page ebook \"Gym Basics\", with 48 Additional Strength Exercises (Pictures Included) and access my private facebook group so you can ask questions, interact with others and share your success stories.\nThis muscle building course and workout is right for anyone and will show you how to build muscle and gain weight with the right workout routines and workout plan.

Typically at 2-4 sessions per week\nSemi-private training: $20-$40/session.

Treating your body right with the proper diet and exercise program is not only a means of losing weight, getting a ripped physique, and showing off your six pack abs.\nExercise and eating right can save you tens or HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars of the years on doctors appointments, physical therapists, medications, and even surgeries.\nAlso, if you find that this plan does not work for you, I want to make sure you find the plan that does. Try it out for 30 days, and if you aren't satisfied get 100% of your money back, guaranteed.\nYou can try this course at no risk, and potentially enroll in something that will change your body, confidence, and self-perception for the rest of your life.\nMy Clients and Personal Experience in Mass Gaining\nMy first client of all-time, was a friend of mine who was underweight, unhappy, and under-confident in the way he looked and felt. He said that he felt weak, insignificant, and really self-conscious. He said that he was hungry for change, and he wanted me to train him.\nIn four months, this same client gained almost 25 pounds of muscle mass and radically changed his life. From a broken shell of a man with a lowered head and a thin frame, I watched a muscular, confident phoenix emerge.\nHe started getting compliments like \"Wow! You look great\" and \"What have you been doing the last few months?\" \"How can I look like that?\" \"How have you gained all that muscle?\"\nI watched life spring into him. This transformation made me realize that gaining muscle is more than just getting bigger and stronger. It isn't just about being respected, intimidating, or getting people to notice you.\n*It's about breaking mental and physical barriers, redefining your genetic potential, building confidence, and building a better existence.\nDon't put off your life for another minute.\nYou could spend thousands of dollars on personal training sessions and dietary consultation to gain the muscle that you want. At the end of that though, you aren't going to know why or how you got there.\nYou will walk the path to muscle mass without ever knowing exactly what you were doing to get there. Those professionals will make you dependent on their recurring service to get you where you want to be, and keep you there\nYou will fall off track, lose that mass, regain your old habits and go back to square one.\n***So why is this course on gaining muscle mass different from other fitness solutions?\nWith this course, you are getting the total package and 100% life-time access for a one time purchase. That includes any and all additions and updates that I will make to this course to enhance your muscle mass.\nYou are not just going to get the results you want. I am going to teach you why and how you got there so that you are going to be an expert on your own. With this course I am giving you all of the tools, knowledge, and experience you need to succeed on your own.\nClick \"Take this course\" to get started on building the body of your dreams and transforming your life forever.\nI can't wait to hear about your results. See you on the inside!\n-Jack",

In relation to running for example, a runner is cross training when alongside the running program she does a cycling, swimming or strength training session to enhance the running program. It improves strength and flexibility in muscles that running cannot.\nIn one workout, cross training includes 45 minutes of an intense program with exercises from a variety of workouts. The result; Intense HIIT workout that burns calories and sweats.\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has gained popularity for its effectiveness in improving cardiovascular fitness and overall health. Here are some positive aspects of HIIT:\nEfficient Time Use: HIIT workouts are typically short but intense, making them a time-efficient option for individuals with busy schedules. Short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by rest or lower-intensity periods can provide significant benefits in a relatively short amount of time.\nImproved Cardiovascular Health: HIIT has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health by improving heart function, increasing oxygen consumption, and promoting better circulation. It can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\nFat Loss and Weight Management: HIIT has been found to be effective for burning calories and promoting fat loss. The intense nature of the workouts can elevate the metabolic rate, leading to increased calorie expenditure both during and after the exercise session.\nMuscle Preservation: Unlike some traditional forms of steady-state cardio, HIIT has been shown to help preserve muscle mass while promoting fat loss. This is particularly beneficial for those looking to improve body composition.\nIncreased Metabolism: HIIT can elevate the resting metabolic rate, causing the body to burn more calories even when at rest. This is known as the afterburn effect or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC).\nImproved Insulin Sensitivity: HIIT has been associated with increased insulin sensitivity, which is beneficial for blood sugar control. This can be particularly important for individuals at risk of or managing type 2 diabetes.\nAdaptability: HIIT workouts can be adapted to various fitness levels and preferences. They can be performed using bodyweight exercises, with equipment, or as part of different exercise modalities such as running, cycling, or swimming.\nIncreased Endurance and Performance: Regular HIIT sessions can improve overall endurance and enhance athletic performance. This is beneficial not only for athletes but also for individuals looking to improve their stamina in daily activities.\nVariety and Challenge: HIIT workouts can be easily modified to add variety, preventing boredom and plateaus. The constant variation in intensity and exercises can keep workouts challenging and engaging.\nAccessibility: HIIT workouts can often be done with minimal or no equipment, making them accessible for people who may not have access to a gym or prefer to work out at home.\nWhile HIIT offers numerous benefits, it's important to note that it may not be suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain health conditions or injuries should consult with a healthcare professional before starting a HIIT program. Additionally, proper form and gradual progression are essential to avoid the risk of injury.\n\n\nIn addition, if you run often, do swimming, cycling or rowing as they can strengthen your physical condition without burdening your body with the impact that running causes.\nAnd by engaging different muscle groups, you can correct imbalances and strengthen overall. This will help you run for longer. And in case you get injured, you'll have a familiar option to maintain your fitness.\nShow consistency!\nRegularly participating in a group program at the gym is an easy way to cross train. And if you prefer to work out alone, set a regular date and place, such as a bike ride in your neighborhood once a week, so the habit can form.",

      "description": "The kettlebell snatch is one of the best kettlebell training exercises for weight loss. There are no other exercises that compare when it comes to cardio. The snatch is incredibly suitable for anaerobic exercise but at the same also for aerobic exercise. Great to program for interval training. With a simple 30-minute kettlebell snatch workout you could easily burn over 600 calories.\nI have devoted a whole lecture to programming the kettlebell snatch for weight loss. I will explain different ways to program this kettlebell exercise for weight loss yourself after you learned how to execute many different variations of the snatch.\n\n\nOne of the most important things with any exercise is to first be able to perform it without injury. I will teach you how to avoid ripping your hands, avoid bruising of the wrists, and learn how to perform the king of kettlebell exercises efficiently.\n\n\nAs a qualified kettlebell coach I have put over a decade of snatch experience into this course that will teach anyone how to kettlebell snatch. This course is designed for beginners but also for advanced. I designed it so that it takes you from day one, never having snatched, to snatching heavy weight and high volume reps. I will cover snatch variations that will make your workouts exciting and you can also use the knowledge from this course to get serious about entering kettlebell sport.\n\n\nWhy kettlebell snatch?\nCardio and strength in one exercise\nEndurance\nMental toughness\nPower\nFull-body exercise\nBurn serious calories\nAlso known as the king of kettlebell exercises.\n\n\nI've broken this course down into one part where you can just quickly get the info you need to snatch and I've devoted a huge section to explaining the snatch in details over 21 days. You can chose what path you take, you might want to get quickly into it or you might want to delve deep, the option is there for you. I've also added a whole lecture on kettlebell workouts with the snatch exercise so you can put into action what you've learned. I know if you take this course you won't be disappointed and walk away snatching like a pro in no time!\n\n\nPlease make sure you read the full description of the course.\n\n\nPREMIUM Included in this course is:\nOur popular Amazon book with over 15,000 words and many photos about the kettlebell snatch available for download\nKettlebell snatch workouts\nOptional tasks to complete\nOptional assessments\nAccess to a qualified kettlebell coach with a passion to teach you\n\n\nI could say so much more but here's what other people have said:\n\n\nI adore kettlebells, therefore, my research led me to Cavemantraining. Watching the videos where Taco and Anna demonstrate the exercises opened up a new view of training with the Kettlebell. Then the Snatch camp started where in 21 days we should learn how to properly perform an exercise Snatch.\nThe snatch exercise was parsed into atoms and molecules. The videos Taco demonstrated were extensive and detailed. We were just supposed to practice on instructions. I've really been skeptical so far regarding the courses that are being held online. Now I'm sure a beginner who just met with Kettlebell could learn how to perform the snatch exercise.\nI liked the feedback on our videos, which was sincere, professional, detailed and easily comprehensible.\nVjekoslava Petroci Fićković\n\n\nI've had a set of kettlebells for 10 years now, all from Russia, brought to me by a friend. I've used them mainly for swings until a few months back. Then I came across Cavemantraining, and it was like the moment that the world changed from black and white into color in the Wizard of Oz.\nThe snatch course is the first time I've been properly trained in kettlebell technique, and as many of you already know, Taco brings a dedicated and humble expertise to the task. What I did not anticipate is how effective his format is.\nHere's how it works. Taco demonstrates a portion of the snatch. Then you practice it, video yourself doing it, and upload it to the snatch camp group. It takes a bit of courage and a bit of time, but this feedback loop is very valuable.\nFirst, you see yourself through the video and wonder how Taco makes it look so easy. Then you see others struggling to master the sequence just like you are. And then Taco will leave a suggestion or comment on each video. I found Taco Fleur's feedback to each participant to be very insightful, consistently picking up on small details that make a big difference. I learned from everyone.\nIt's weird, but there's a sort of thrill, a deep satisfaction, that comes with executing a kettlebell exercise well ... especially the snatch because it is such a full body movement.\nNando Deva\n\n\nCavemantraining with Taco Fleur. As a few others have given praise for the snatch course just now wrapping up, I overwhelmingly agree with all sentiments and thanks.\nResults? I entered the course unable to snatch without gloves and had an overall lack of confidence in the skill. Now I can snatch for volume (100+ reps) and weight (36kg and 32kg below). I can train every day and not worry about recovery from tearing.\nBut results don’t do the journey justice. Over the course of the camp. My fellow students and myself were guided by Taco’s incredible wealth of knowledge - his guidance was thorough, step by step progressions to help us reach our ultimate goals. Form, safety, and fun.\nI can’t overstate how impressed I was with the personal feedback during the course. Taco gave us each very detailed feedback the day we posted videos that were honest and easy to respond to. This process of videoing my technique coupled with Taco's feedback accelerated my development incredibly. For the price of a couple of PT training sessions with some young inexperienced protein shake drinking yonko, you could receive personalized feedback by one of the worlds best.\nFinally. It was a pleasure to socialize with like-minded people from around the world. Like Nando Deva I will miss this crew and hope to stay in touch as we all continue to play with the bells.\nLooking forward to future courses. Much love.\nJustin Feiereisel Barnett\n\n\nAnyone thinking about joining Taco Fleur, for his Snatch Camp by Cavemantraining, do it. I wasn’t sure, didn’t know what to expect, and didn’t know if it’d be for me. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to join in, paid my money, followed the program, and couldn’t be happier.\nI was fairly new to kettlebell training, but was also doing a few things wrong, without even knowing it. I wouldn’t have progressed properly, by just watching training videos, and swinging kettlebells. Taco Fleur is able to point out what you’re doing right, what you’re doing wrong, and how to progress properly. I know I’m no kettlebell professional, but I now know enough to train hard without tearing myself up.\nThis really is an awesome value for money. Anyone interested in getting into kettlebell training, or anyone that is having any issues with their snatch, should do this course.\nThank you Taco Fleur, for your patience, great advice, and an excellent training course.\nShane Hansen\n\n\nAbout me\nI have snatched 10 minutes unbroken with only one hand switch, snatched 532 reps unbroken in 30 minutes, and so much more. My qualifications are as follows.\nCavemantraining Certified, IKFF Certified Kettlebell Teacher, Kettlebell Sport Rank 2, Russian Girevoy Sport Institute Kettlebell Coach, CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, CrossFit Judges Certificate, CrossFit Lesson Planning Certificate, Kettlebells Level 2 Trainer, Kettlebell Science and Application, MMA Fitness Level 2, MMA Conditioning Level 1, BJJ Purple Belt and more. Owner of Cavemantraining, World Kettlebell Community, and Kettlebell Training Education. Featured in 4 issues of the Iron Man magazine.\n\n\nImportant Notice\nI would like to be upfront and tell you about the audio/video in one of the 20+ videos, it's not good quality, it's good enough to hear/see the instructions but it's not top notch high end video production and has noise plus echo. I want to make this clear to you before you purchase the course. If you believe you might leave a negative review because of the audio/video then please do not purchase this course.\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation.

      "description": "Why do you need to study this course?\nNowadays, Tai Chi teaching has spread all over the world. Although we have entered the information and digital age, the teaching of Tai Chi abroad is still far behind that in China, because most foreign Tai Chi practitioners do not know the development and changes of Tai Chi in China. In the 1980s, a new Tai Chi, called Hunyuan Tai Chi, appeared in China.\nHunyuan Tai Chi was founded by Mr. Feng Zhiqiang (1928-2012), a famous master of Taiji and Chinese martial arts. Mr. Feng Zhiqiang is the most important Tai Chi master in China since the 1970s. He plays a connecting role in Tai Chi imparting and inheriting. He taught Chen Style Tai Chi Laojia to the descendants of Chen-family: Chen Xiaowang, Chen zhenglei, Zhu Tiancai and Wang Xi'an.\nAt the same time, Mr. Feng Zhiqiang founded Hunyuan Tai Chi, which is loved by Tai Chi practitioner in China and widely recognized and praised by Chinese Wushu circles. As a result, Hunyuan Tai Chi stood out from the old Chen Style，and opened a new era of the popularization and development of traditional Tai Chi.\nWhat are the characteristics of Hunyuan Tai Chi?\nHunyuan Tai Chi has three characteristics. First, focus on internal skills and benefit the public. Hunyuan Tai Chi inherited and developed the tradition of internal and external cultivation together, making Tai Chi return to internal skill school. This highlights that Tai Chi is the attribute of Neijiaquan, which makes Tai Chi adapt to the development needs of public health.\nSecond, truth striking and true martial arts. Mr. Feng Zhiqiang is a recognized martial artist in Chinese Tai Chi. There are many good inheritors of martial arts under Feng Gong's door. They don't do the show, don't be mysterious, don't make a fuss, and really practice. These are reflected in the pushing hands and Sanshou training of Hunyuan Tai Chi.\nThird, both life cultivation and virtue and art. Hunyuan Tai Chi not only has internal skills, routines and pushing hands, but also Mr. Feng Zhiqiang gives it a higher level of cultivation content. It is not only a skill learning, but also a moral cultivation and cultural cultivation, reaching a higher level of cultivation of personality and human nature.\nWhat are the learning courses of Hunyuan Tai Chi?\nHunyuan Tai Chi is mainly composed of the internal skills, routines of weapons and boxing, push hands. The courses on Udemy platform include \"Hunyuan Tai Chi 24 Forms\",  \"Hunyuan Tai Chi Cannon 32 Forms\", \"Hunyuan Tai Chi 48 Forms\", \"Hunyuan Tai Chi Cannon 46 Forms\", \"Hunyuan Tai Chi Sword\", \"Hunyuan Tai Chi Saber\", \"Stance training\", \"Basic of Tai Chi Kungfu\", \"Tai Chi boxing and kicking\", \"Joint-locking up skill\", \"Tai Chi Tumbling and Wrestling\", \"Tai Chi hitting pile\".\nIs Hunyuan Tai Chi as popular in the world as other Tai Chi schools?\nWhen you retrieve this course, you are lucky. Because this is the first time that Mr. Zhang Jiping provides Hunyuan Tai Chi course to Udemy platform, so that foreign friends can know now. Therefore, although these courses are taught in Chinese, it is the earliest for foreign countries. Just now you're like Columbus who discovered the new world, aren't you?\nWhat kind of teacher is Zhang Jiping?\nMr. Zhang Jiping is one of Mr. Feng Zhiqiang's favorite disciples and the 11th generation successor of Chen Style Tai Chi. In 2014, he was elected secretary general of the International Hunyuan Tai Chi Federation.\nMr. Zhang graduated from Changchun University of traditional Chinese medicine. He practiced martial arts since childhood. When he was young, he had three other masters. Mr. Zhang's Kungfu is very good. He is the fighting instructor of the Judicial Police Corps of Jilin Province, with 7-Dan of Chinese martial arts.\nMr. Zhang Jiping's course is an important teaching of Hunyuan Tai Chi. The course categories are comprehensive, the teaching standards are detailed, and the action demonstration are standard. The courses of Mr. Zhang on Udemy are just the courses used by Tai Chi practitioners in China.\nWhat is the routine Hunyuan Tai Chi 24 Froms?\nHunyuan Tai Chi 24 Forms is the basic routine, and it is also the most widely spread routine in China. It is a simplification of Hunyuan Tai Chi 48 Forms, and the action comes from the old Chen Style Tai Chi. But its movement style is very different from the old Chen Style. The 24 movements of Hunyuan Tai Chi are used for health care. They highlight relaxation, promote the circulation of Qi and blood, and do not harm the body.\nBy learning Hunyuan Tai Chi 24 Forms, you will enter a new realm of Tai Chi, and your level will be greatly improved to keep pace with the development of China now.",

      "description": "*****UPDATED MAY 5, 2015*****\nIf you go to the gym four times a week for an hour each time then you are being physically active for roughly 2.4% of that week.\nSo it's safe to say that in order to see any significant results we must strive to give 100% of ourselves WITHIN those 2.4%. But performing at 100% all the time is impossible. So what do you do?\nShould you focus in just working out harder? No, you should focus in training smarter.\nThis course is about giving you a better way to workout.\nBut first let me ask you a few questions.\nDo you ever get stuck trying to figure what workouts to do and how to put them together?\nDo you have a limited amount of time that you must dedicate to training?\nAre you fed up doing the same cardio workouts over and over again?\nDoes your current routine need an overhaul?\nThe sole purpose of this course is to teach you an effective, purposeful and organized way to approach your strength and fat loss goals. And to save you time, lots of it.\nWhy should you learn to use kettlebells? Why should you incorporate bodyweight training into your workout routines?\nThere are tons of ways to get fit but successful training should meet a couple of criteria:\nIt should be somewhat enjoyable.\nIt shouldn't be too long where you might get bored or even dread the idea of even starting.\nThey must be challenging.\nIt should be purposeful. Failing to plan is planning to fail.\nThis course blends all these attributes together.\nRedefining cardio.\nA complete exercise regimen should address not only resistance training but cardiovascular training as well. Approaching your fitness this way is essential to your training success.\nIncorporating bodyweight training and kettlebells into your routine allows you to bring cardio and strength training into the same session.\nYou think running or cycling is the ONLY way to enhance your cardio respiratory fitness?\nThink again, cardio fitness is described as the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity.\nKeyword in the prior sentence is SUSTAINED.\nIn this course you will do your workouts in circuits, moving from exercise to exercise. But not just ANY exercise.\nNot ONE exercise in this course isolates only one muscle.\nPerforming total body movements is essential for optimal fat burning.\nSitting from machine to machine is not going to make your burn fat efficiently.\nExperience a complete body transformation.\nYes, the movements in this course will increase fat loss.\nYes, the movements in this course will help you get stronger.\nBut….\nYou will also work on flexibility, posture, range of motion, mobility, stability and even power by using total body movements that require awareness, skill and control.\nWorking on these other aspects of training improves our day to day activities.\nHaving great abs is a pretty a cool achievement. But having great abs with a weak back sucks.\nThere's so much more to core training than just doing crunches. In this course you will practice movements that will work on your core while working on other important aspects like stability and mobility.\nThe Turkish Get Up (TGU) is an example of this.\nKeep burning calories AFTER your training sessions are over.\nBurning calories during your workout is only one part of your training. More importantly is how can we continue to burn calories AFTER our training sessions?\nThe way to do this is to approach your training with workouts that elicit high levels of EPOC (Excess Post Oxygen Consumption). EPOC is a state where our body is in an oxygen deficit. The only way to achieve this is by increasing the intensity of the workout.\nDuring this state, our oxygen consumption is elevated and our bodies go through different metabolic processes to bring it back to it's normal state. This causes our bodies to burn tons of calories.\nKettlebell swings for example, are a popular movement that is often integrated into circuits that produce high levels of EPOC.\nLearn to warm up properly.\nWe were once told to stretch before engaging in physical activity. People still do this. Stretching before working out inhibits power production. It can reduce performance up to 5% according to the the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.\nIn this course I show you the right way to warm up. And you can use this warm up for other physical activities as well.\nSitting is the new smoking.\nSo let's say you already go to the gym. But most of your routine (without you being really aware of it) requires you to sit down to either push, pull or crunch.\nWe spend time sitting, commuting in our cars, bound to our work desk, slouched over our keyboards and yet we go to the gym and most of our training is sitting.\nIn a 2012 study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, researchers reported that people spent an average of 64 hours a week sitting and 28 hours standing!\nSixty four hours a week!\nWe were designed to move and this course gives you just that.\nHere are some of the workout templates that will be included in your 34 page full colored guide.\nTime Based Workouts\nCircuit Style Training\nDIY (Do It Yourself) templates where you incorporate exercises from this course.\nCore Based programs that will ignite your midsection.\nLower Body focused programs\nSix Weeks Strength and Conditioning programs\nEnjoy workouts to increase weight loss, improve oxygen utilization and improve metabolism.\nAnd much more..\nDOWNLOADS ARE ENABLED FOR THIS COURSE.\nSome of the exercises in this course are unique to kettlebell training.\nCrunches are so 1990, train not JUST your abs but your entire core.\nEnjoy already done for you programs. More programs will be added throughout the year.\nENJOY THE ACCESSIBILITY OF CLOSED CAPTIONS ON EVERY SINGLE VIDEO.\nIf you don't absolutely enjoy my course then get your money back with a 30 day money back guarantee. NO questions asked.",

      "description": "Pilates for Complete Beginners is designed to comfortably get you ready for a full Pilates class, which is also included in this course.\n\n\nI have been teaching Pilates for over 17 years and decided to bring the fundamentals to you. This is a home made course with limited lighting, but the information provided comes from years of working in the industry with many professionals giving guidance along the way. Proof that not all that is golden has to shine.\n\n\nPilates is a type of exercise system where you place your body in the correct alignment for each exercise. By doing this you lower exercise related risks and improve the quality of each move is increased ten fold. Please ensure your physician has given you the thumbs up to exercise.\n\n\nThe exercise of choice for people who aren't into gym vibes and hardcore trainers. My approach is gentle. Building up is better than jumping into the deep end.\n\n\n\"I never loved exercise until I was introduced to Pilates. I now do it 5 days a week\" raves Sheila, whose been a client of mine for over a decade and is in her mid 70's.\n\n\nThe movements are done slowly - have you ever tried doing a push up slowly - it's much more effective. p.s. we don't generally do push ups in Pilates so please don't loose interest yet. So it's slow, controlled exercises where a smaller move is usually more effective than a bigger move. For this reason Pilates suits those who don't want to sweat and get out of breath.\n\n\nWhen you can hold the correct positions while performing an exercise, you start to work multiple muscle groups and those muscle groups are the precise ones that correct your posture. Do you want to make your workout more effective? This is the method for you.\n\n\nThere are Six Principles that oversee your Pilates practice. These include:\n\n\n- Breathing\n- Rib Placement\n- Shoulder Positions\n- Activating your Core muscles effectively\n- Head Placement\n- Lower Back placement\n\n\nBetter than just improving your Pilates exercises you can then start to use these Six Principles when you do any other kind of exercise as well - Optimizing any fitness regiment you do.\n\n\nOnce we've learnt these Principles we'll start to build the foundation Matwork exercises (one at a time) incorporating all six steps simultaneously.\n\n\nThis may sound daunting but you will get the hang of it easily. You can then spend time repeating these steps to grow your confidence or go on to do the full workouts provided.\n\n\nBefore each workout you must do the warm up and after the workout please do the stretches provided. These steps are crucial to the safety of the exercises.\n\n\nGrant says \"Pilates has completely changed my life, I've improved my performance on all my extreme sports and lowered the aches and pains that used to follow me daily\"",

I cover many major running-related topics:\nEvolution of running: How any why we are all designed to be runners.\nRunning biomechanics: Deep dive into running gait patterns.\nRunning-related injuries: How to mitigate the five most common running-related injuries.\nExercises designed for injury prevention and optimizing performance: Cover hip, quad, ankle, and foot strength/performance exercises to ensure your limbs are bulletproof to whatever you throw at them. This section comes with instructional videos to ensure you are performing these exercises with perfect form and effectiveness.\nMy most commonly asked running-related questions:\nDoes foot posture and specific running shoes  really matter for most runners?\nWhat is heel-to-toe drop and it's relevance to running?\nShould I switch to minimalist running shoes?\nShould I use orthotics?\nShould I be doing static stretching?\nIs running cadence important?\nIs it okay to train on a treadmill vs. overground?\nIs it okay to run during pregnancy?\nDoes running cause arthritis?\n\n\nI hope you enjoy!\n\n\n- Nick Schumacher, PT, DPT, SCS, OCS, FAAOMPT, CSCS\n\n\n*This course provides information and instruction on strategies to minimize the risk of running-related injuries.

Bodyweight exercises are great for that. You need nothing but your own body, can choose your own workout location and train whenever you want.\nBut this program does more than teach you a few exercises and workout tips. In the course I go over the science behind building muscle and successful dieting, the perfect beginner workout plan and show you how to set clear and well-defined fitness goals that keep you motivated.\nBy giving you the necessary tools to reach your fitness goals, I will also have to debunk certain training myths that have been around for decades. How many times have you been told that if in order to build muscle you need to…\nExercise at least five times per week…\nTrain two or even three hours…\nDrink two or more protein shakes per day…\nAnd perfectly time your meals no more than three hours apart.\nAs you will see in the course, most of these “tips” are nonsense and some will even work against you in the long run. Instead I will show you the exact training methods that are scientifically proven to work.\nHere is what's inside the program:\nThe Step-By-Step Muscle Building Formula\nThe Step-By-Step Fat Loss Formula\nThe Full Bodyweight Workout Program\nExercise Videos To Help You Train With Perfect Form\nEverything You Need To Know About Nutrition And Dieting\nMy 100 page ebook \"Bodyweight Basics\", with 44 Additional Bodyweight Exercises (Pictures Included)\nA Lesson On How To Stay Motivated Through Clear Goals\nThis home workout is great to build muscle, lose weight and workout at home. You can do basic bodyweight exercises and bodyweight fitness anywhere which makes this bodyweight workout the perfect muscle building course if you are looking to boost your fitness. Body weight exercises are really the simplest to gain muscle and lose fat.\n\n\n__________________________________________\nLet’s See What My Students Have To Say\n\n\n“As far as the teaching goes it is exactly what I had hoped for. The simplicity in explanation makes it far easier for a beginner like myself to follow, understand, and go back to when I need it. The believability of the course is ultimately the best part about it. I feel like I can trust Felix in what he is saying. I look forward to continuing this path.” - Daniel David Wolfert\n\n\n“I’m learning a lot of new information in a very easy to understand format. It’s true that everyone has something they swear by to lose weight and get in shape... so it’s tough to sort through the junk science. I really like the presentation of the information.” - Denise\n\n\n“Came into this course expecting details for a good workout routine, but wasn't expecting the dieting and nutrition tips. I wouldn't have considered that the timing of meals matters as much as it does or that taking in excess calories might be a good thing in some cases. I feel like I learned a lot and I'm hoping to put this knowledge to good use!” - Tristan Balgemann\n__________________________________________\nJoin me and thousands of other students to start your own fitness journey!\nScroll Up And Get \"Build Muscle Without A Gym\" If You Want To See Real Results",

The program of this course is for one week, but you can simply do this exercise forever, just change the repetition, or pick your favorite positions and do more of those.\n\n\nWe will focus on our arms, legs, stomach muscles, and deep stability muscles.

The exercises featured in this course can be done right after a vaginal delivery. If you had a c-section it may be best to wait a few weeks until you’ve received doctors clearance. The exercises included are also suitable if you have a Diastasis Recti.\nOur bodies went through an amazing process, organs were squeezed and moved around, our diaphragm which is the muscle we use to breathe got pushed up and most likely stopped working as it should, the pelvic floor had to handle great amounts of pressure from the growing baby, your Abs stretched out, your posture also changes. Your body went through a lot of changes and after pregnancy our bodies don’t function as it did pre pregnancy with the snap of a finger, we need a structured approach like the one offered in this course to help us recover.\nIn this course, You get short 10 minute or less workouts all heavily focused on rehabbing and strengthening your Core and pelvic floor, and exercises designed to improve your posture. I focused on these areas because they’re commonly affected in pregnancy. You will learn proper breathing techniques, how to engage/brace Your Core to make every exercise effective, how to contract Your pelvic floor, how to perform all exercises with proper form and more. You'll learn all this over a  4 week period, I’m not just giving you a bunch of exercises to do haphazardly, this is a structured approach to recovery that will help lay the foundation for any exercises you do in the future. Remember it took 9 months to grow so it will take some time to recover, during this recovery period repetition of exercises and consistency are key to seeing and feeling results. This program is great for all fitness levels.",

This not only increases your preparedness but considerably reduces the time you will otherwise spend to gather information on your own because you can take advantage from the instructor's experience who has already been there, done that!\nIf you wish for more information and tips, and most importantly, if you have clarifications and questions, no worries! The instructor will be around at the discussion forum to assist you further. Just post your questions and he will respond to them promptly.\n\nIn terms of tangible outputs, this course will enable you to run a distance of 10 kilometers in 8 weeks using the sound principles of training, exercise, nutrition, and sleep.   It is guaranteed that you can achieve this milestone while being stress-free (well, little bit of positive stress is good!) and injury-free too!\nCome, add this course to your cart to become a fit YOU and a role model for others!\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nContent and Overview\n\nThis course is divided into five parts:\nPart 1: An Overview to Running – Here you will get a historical overview to running and understand how it is the most affordable sport requiring negligible investment. You will also get a sense of the benefits running can bring to you and to your social life.\nPart 2: Prepare Yourself to Run – Here together, we will examine the running essentials and see how 3-4 days of running per the plan can improve the quality of your life. We will also see the importance of setting realistic achievable targets and why 10K is the ideal distance for anybody aspiring to be fit and with a little bit of challenge thrown in!\nPart 3: Nutrition and Sleep – Here, we will talk about what to eat, what not to eat, how much to eat, and at what time. You will also see how some specific foods are well suited to the sport of running and their role in quick recovery. We will also touch upon sleep and the myriad benefits it brings.\nPart 4: Training Plan and Exercises – This is the engine of the course which talks in detail about the plan you will be following for the next 8 weeks. Besides run days, we will be talking about the importance of rest days and cross training days. While running causes some amount of wear and tear, what we eat and how we strength train our body for optimal returns, results in a totally injury-free running experience.\n\n\nPart 5: The Zen of Running – This part includes important considerations that we don’t often talk about in the context of running. Here we will be talking about things like how to run for the joy of running and not make it a slugfest of timing and distances, how to incorporate yoga practices to truly experience total bliss in the state of running, and more.",

Just the mere dream to lose weight can seem hopeless.\nAre you busy with your job or career? (working 40-70+ hours per week)\nDo you spend late nights and early mornings in the office and at work?\nAre you exhausted when you get home from work?\nDo you have family and friends that you wish you could spend more time with?\nDo you have hobbies that have taken the backseat to work and obligations?\nHave you gained 10, 20, 30, 40+ pounds in the last 1-5 years?\nAre you having trouble fitting in your jeans?\nHave you tried other programs to lose weight, but have failed to stick with it?\nDo you want to be healthy for your wife, husband, parents, children, friends, and family, but feel like you don't have time to eat healthier or workout?\nNot enough time to cook and make healthier eating choices, to help them lose weight\nNo time to workout to lose weight\nThey are completely exhausted at the end of everyday.\nBurns just as many (if not more) calories than running does\nBurns fat during your workout, and up to 32 hours after your workout is over\nIs a combination of strength and cardiovascular training\nTakes a minimum amount of time: 10-20 minutes per workout\nIs significantly lower impact than most any other cardiovascular activity\nIs affordable and portable, so that you can workout anywhere\nBuilds muscle and increases your metabolism\nSo how do you lose weight and get ripped without spending THOUSANDS of dollars on...\nA gym membership $40-$149/month\nFitness classes $180-$349/month\nPersonal training: $60-$100/session. Typically at 2-4 sessions per week\nSemi-private training: $20-$40/session. Typically at 2-4 sessions per week\nSee how this can all start to add up? Don't get me wrong here, I believe that your health is absolutely worth it. Treating your body right with the proper diet and exercise program is not only a means of losing weight, getting a ripped physique, and showing off your six pack abs.\nExercise and eating right can save you tens or HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars of the years on doctors appointments, physical therapists, medications, and even surgeries.\n\n\nSo if you have been struggling to lose weight, and you need to lose weight but don't think that you have the time to commit to overhauling your lifestyle completely, you don't have to.\n*This program is designed to help you...\nWorkout less\nAchieve more\nEat all the foods you love, and still lose weight\nSave time in the kitchen and at the grocery store so you can focus on the things and people in life that are more important.\nIf you are hesitant about taking this course, no worries at all.

This is not a problem, it is a good thing. Usually our mind gives very intelligent and safe instructions to out body on how and where to move. But what if we can have the same trust in the intelligence of our body? What if we can let our body move, and our mind observe? The goal from Schaefer Method is to free up your body so much, that your body will slowly take over control over moving ,instead of your mind. Of course your body will transform too…:)\n\n\nSchaefer Method Philosophy\nThe human body has evolved over thousands and thousands of years. It had to adjust and improve constantly to create a lot of different movement capabilities or languages, in order to survive. Nowadays we only use a small fraction for our day to day life and also for our exercise regimes. Time to learn some new, or better old, languages to improve your range of motions.\n\n\nWhat does Schaefer Method Incorporate?\nIn order to achieve a feeling of flow and connectivity with yourself and the world around you, the method tries to incorporate each of the following training areas into every practice\n\n\n1. Meditation:\n-Even just focusing inwards for a few breaths can be a powerful tool to recentre. We will look at different forms of meditation and try them out as a short moment to enter and exit a practice.\n\n\n2. Balance:\nIn Schaefer Method, balance is the ability to maintain a controlled line of gravity (vertical line from centre of mass) of a body within the base of support with minimal uncontrolled postural sway.\n\n\n3. Strength:\nWhat can I say, no pain no gain. We will work them muscles, our goal is not to make your muscular system hard and inefficient, but you will hopefully feel a burn.\n\n\n4. Mobility:\nWe will not really “stretch” in Schaefer Method. What we will do is try and achieve a greater movement radius in your joints through mobility work. The main difference between “stretching” and “mobility” work is that you are using gravity and weight in stretching, whereas in mobility practice you are using muscular strength to open joints.\n\n\n5. Animal Locomotion:\nHumans are amazing learners from observing. We can observe our surroundings and easily copy someone or something if it makes sense for us. Let us learn some languages from the animal kingdom.\n\n\n6. Agility:\nAgility is the ability to change the body's position efficiently, and requires the integration of isolated movement skills using a combination of balance, coordination, strength, and endurance.\n\n\n7. Floor work:\nTo roll around, to crawl, to use all 4 extremities, these things we do as kids, and eventually get told that adults don't do that. Adults do that!\n\n\n8. Free Movement:\nThe royal discipline of movement training. You choose, you move, you flow.\n\n\n9. Release:\nWhat goes up, must go down. If you train and strengthen your muscles, you also have to find ways to release them, to stay relaxed in your body and mind.\n\n\nTIP: If one of the movement patterns is too complex to achieve on the first or second or 8th time, practice patience and stay in slow motion until you master it.\n\n\nSupported and sponsored by\nNobody can do anything by themselves. We all have helpers, teachers, mentors, just as much as we have students. Here are mine.\n\n\nboerlinboerds\nfor the great movement outfits\ngowithgertrud\nfor your wisdom, your intelligence and your constant support.\nfenriz-tz\nfor your support and for constantly challenging me.\nina-schoof\nfor often making me look good and for your generosity.\ntetokiharuru\nthanks to Charles Koroneho for explaining space to me.",

      "description": "Running is the most tried-and-tested, scientifically proven, and effective approach to enabling people to lose weight, stay healthy, look good and feel great. Humans are designed to run – yet sadly the approach that worked for thousands of years has been lost. It’s been lost in competition, “trying harder”, “no pain no gain” approaches. The result is that the secret of the most effective, time-tested approach has been lost. Yet an overwhelming amount of scientific research is proving that the lost art of running easy is the ultimate approach to a healthy, energized and long life. It’s time to discover this life-changing approach once again.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is designed for non-runners and those with some basic running fitness. So, whether you have never run before, or if you have some basic fitness but have always dreamed of running a half marathon, this is the most comprehensive, easy-to-follow course available.\nWhy do this course?\nRunning Easy approach - only 4 training days a week\nYou will achieve your goal of running a 21km/13mi half marathon\nYou will enjoy the experience\nYou will learn from two experienced, ordinary people like you\nYou will get a guy and girls perspective on how to run and achieve your goal\nYou will experience the unique, scientifically supported Running Easy approach to running\nYou will be guided week-by-week as to what to do and how to train\nYou will be shown practically how to run efficiently\nYou will be given lots of vital Rundamentals that will keep you safe and enjoy your runs\nYou will be inspired to achieve something that will change your life forever\nYou will achieve your bucket list item – running a half marathon!\n10 Reasons to start this course today\nIf you want to lose weight, get fit, stay healthy and feel great then you need to listen to science. Science has proven that running is the most effective way to:\nLose weight (burn 15% more calories in the 48 hours after a run)\nBe healthier with less risk of colds and flu\nReduce the risk of death from all major causes by 70%\nLive longer with less disability in old age\nImprove bone density and reduce risk of arthritis in old age by 50%\nImprove memory and brainpower\nIncrease productivity by over 15% per day\nBoost concentration and treat ADHD\nIncrease overall happiness\nLive a fuller, more rewarding lifestyle.\nYour coaches\nJoin Craig and Nicky, as we take you on a journey that will change your life (literally) forever, as we train you to run (with a smile) your first half marathon (21km/13mi). In addition to being one of the most desired bucket list goals, achieving a half marathon will change your life forever.\nSo, who are we, and why do you want us to guide you on this exciting journey? Well, quite simply because we are ordinary people – like you. We have not won any Olympic medals. We don’t hold any world records. You may be wondering why then we should be your coaches on this exciting journey. Well, it’s because we are just like you – but, we have achieved extraordinary things. We’ve run over 100 marathons (42km/26mi), over 20 Comrades ultra-marathons (90km/56mi), and many more other ultra-marathons. And yet, despite all this, we are just ordinary people – ordinary people who have achieved extraordinary things. And that is what we want to help you also achieve.\nAll too often running programs are designed by top athletes, Olympic medal holders. However, their bodies and their approaches are not suitable for most people. They follow what we refer to as the “try harder”, the “no sweat, no gain” approach. Yet, while these approaches may win those skilled enough, a medal, they seldom become lifestyle approaches for the rest of us. Our approach, which is based on years of experience, and training (ordinary) people from all around the world, is called the Running Easy approach.\nThe Running Easy approach is a unique, scientifically supported, tried-and-tested approach to running. Rather than try harder, it shows you how to run effectively by trying easier. Rather than pain, it’s about enjoying. Rather than faster times, it’s about fun times. We will show you how to run in a way that not only allows you to achieve your amazing goal but is so enjoyable it will make running part of your life.\nImportant\nWhile this course takes a \"running easy\" approach, it nonetheless can be demanding on your body. So, if you are unsure of your current health, please check with your doctor before commencing the training.\nWhat have others said?\n\"Wooooooooooooooooooooo!!! hellooo!! I am on the biggest high woooo!!! We just got home from Canberra (Marathon) today, and it’s all very surreal... I couldn't help smiling the whole way it was funny. I had one official say to me \"You're running a marathon, this is serious! why are you so happy?\" Ha Ha. 6 months ago walking to my front door was an effort, I would never have believed I could do this! THANK YOU SO MUCH.\" (Michelle)\n\"Craig and Nicky your support and knowledge and experience has been astonishing and I have loved every minute of the course. Anyone who thinks they can't do this, just drop by this course to get a different view. It's life-changing.\" (Nathan)\n\"What can I say!!!!!! ;)...Last Sunday I ran the Sydney Marathon!...Woohooo!!!! What a high!! Craig and Nicky, it has been such an awesome journey and I want to thank you for the effort you've put in to make the course so interesting and enjoyable. Who knew that running could be fun!?!? :) Your passion for running easy is infectious - it will stay with me for the rest of my life.\" (Sally)\n\"Let's face the facts - I'm no lean mean machine. I was born for speed, not distance. Decades on and I can hardly believe it - I ran a marathon! ...So what's the point of my story? Simple. If you have not run a marathon, you still can!... We (my wife and I) followed the Running Easy program and learnt how to. Yes. Yes, I can!\" (Matthew)\n\"We did it. I can hardly believe it, but I can now say we ran a marathon and it's a good feeling, an awesome, exhilarating feeling. Now I know why Craig & Nicky are trying to encourage so many people to run a marathon. The journey, the training, the race, the pain, and finally the glory is something I too encourage you to experience - you will never regret it.\" (Petra)\n\"From couch potato to walking 5 miles on a daily basis in 2010, I wanted to complete a full marathon by the end of 2011. I was very sceptical about my abilities to complete a distance of 26.2 miles injury free... I just followed the running easy approach and the training plan word by word, day by day and completed the 2011 Chicago Marathon successfully... I recommended this book (and course) to a lot of my colleagues and friends since then. Thanks a lot to Craig and Nicky.\" (Sarma)",

      "description": "Zumba online training is the way you can practice Zumba at home!\nAre you looking for a way to keep your body fit without going to the gym?\nThis Online Zumba class is a high-intensity home workout that will take just 15 min out of your day to put your body in the right shape.\n\n\nThe only Udemy Zumba course that is Fitness oriented.\nI know that many people want to train Zumba, but there is no time for visiting the gym, or the gym is too far. And in some places, the Zumba classes are pretty expensive. The Home Workout with beautiful music is an excellent solution for Weight Loss and building muscle without a gym.\n\n\nWith this Online Zumba class, you will use just your bodyweight to transform yourself.\n\n\nThis is why I decided to put together 3 different levels of Zumba online training - beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each one will not take you more than 20 min of your time with the warm-up. But each one will make you sweat and burn the extra calories that we get daily from all the delicious food around us.\nThis is not a dancing class! If you are looking for a leisurely Zumba dance, then this might not be the course for you. This Online Zumba class is more of a high-intensity workout that will put your body in shape. Weight Loss will not be an issue anymore, and you will be using just your bodyweight.\n\n\nZumba is a fantastic way to relax your mind after a long working day, or it could be one of the best ways to start your day.\nAt the same time, you will pump your muscles, stretch your body, and improve your cardio.  You will be impressed with how much you can achieve with a Home Workout.\n\n\nWhat makes this Zumba online training different?\nFirst of all, Zumba is a way to work out the rhythm of beautiful music. Since you are using just your bodyweight, you can do it as a home workout or in the garden with earbuds.\nZumba is suitable for people who have never trained before. The basic training will teach you the basic moves, and you will learn them step-by-step. Still, it will make you sweat. Just the exercises are more straightforward.\nIf you feel the training is too hard when you do it for the first time, do fewer repetitions but try to stay with me until the end. This way, you will push yourself to do more than what you can do at the moment. And this is the only way to progress, especially if you are looking for weight loss.\nAt the same time, if you want to push yourself, even more, jump higher, punch harder and bend your knees more, for example, when doing squats. Your bodyweight is the best equipment you can use.\n\n\nZumba online training will give you the chance to schedule your day.\nWith this online Zumba course, you will not need to consider your daily schedule with fixed-time training. You can train before work, after work, or during the weekend when most comfortable for you.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this Online Zumba class?\nthe basic steps in Zumba\ndifferent exercises that train the whole body\nhow to push yourself to the maximum\nHome Workout that you can do with your family and friends\nweight loss program that will be pleasant\nhow to use your bodyweight to train daily\n\n\nAs a professional trainer, I have helped many people transform their bodies and feel more confident.\nYou will make your money back from the price of this Zumba course because you will not need to pay for a group class, and you can watch the training as many times as you wish. Also, Udemy guarantees it with their no-risk 30-day money-back guarantee.\nYou have nothing to lose. Only calories.\nThank you for signing up for this Zumba course on Udemy, and I will see you in the first training.\nI am also available for any questions on the course discussion board.\nEnroll today and get into better shape!\nWe are happy to hear that the students are satisfied with the course:\n\nAkshay Joshi - Amazing Course. It has helped me reduce few kgs. The way Petko guides during the training is amazing. Moreover The workouts Basic, Intermediate, Advanced helps us with overall fitness and wellbeing.",

      "description": "There are secrets to mastering your bodyweight. Usually only passed on to professional athletes training for things like gymnastics, this knowledge is imperative to gain control in all forms of movement.\nArrow-like handstands frozen in time, strict muscle-ups with no kip or momentum, and levitating into levers are no longer myths but achievable goals for anyone with the correct information and training paths.\nCalisthenics is a form of strength and power training utilising only compound bodyweight exercises. Using isolation exercises doesn't teach the body how to coordinate its strength and balance through the core and into the limbs – Calisthenics helps you to develop that through the pursuit of clean and 'Strict Form'. The techniques learnt can then be mixed with each other into routines (Freestyle Calisthenics/Street Workout), or weight can be added to the movement once strict form has been achieved to keep overloading the body.\nCalisthenics strengthens the body holistically as a unit – it is incredibly useful for those who use their bodies for performance, for example in sports, martial arts, dance and yoga. Whether aiming to improve your ability to keep possession of a ball, developing your punching/kicking power, perfecting your balance or simply just to get stronger, it is an age old training system which will benefit you hugely.",

You lose out on the real benefits, you still build some strength but you never build strength that others envy and your competition regrets.\nPerhaps you have been doing it wrong???\nMaybe you are frustrated because you have been training for 3 months, 6 months, perhaps even 2 years or more, and you’ve hit a plateau. The strength gains have slowed and it appears you’ve hit your limit.\nThen there is conflicting information on the number sets, repetitions and the best exercises…\nMaybe you get that figured out, then you are not sure how many days you should train for optimum results.\nI understand how you feel because when I first started strength training, I didn’t have all the answers either!\n\n\nThe good news is… if you do it right… It’s very easy to progressively get stronger, boost your performance and get all the positive benefits of strength training.\nI have personally invested over 15 years, to the study of strength development.\n\n\nIt’s been closer to 15 years of study and practice. Researching methods for high-level fitness and strength development. I’ve studied 1000’s of programs tried 100’s of them.\nIn those first years, there was significant trial and error, I’d get results than my progress would stall. I thought I had reached my limit and felt like it, until…\nI was searching an old hard drive and stumbled upon one of my old training journals where I had made huge jumps in strength and had an epiphany!\nI had figured it out and put it to the test. My strength started to soar! I was hitting new personal bests and people were asking what was my secret. There was no secret, just significant study, trial and error.\nThe way that you train directly affects the adaptation of your muscles and nervous system. You need to train in such a way that you stimulate your body to develop strength with the perfect number of sets, exercises, repetitions, rest and training frequency.\nThis skills for insane strength have delivered consistent results’ month after month, year after year for myself and others.\nI’ve taught these strength building tactics at my workshops and with my private clients and have seen immediate boosts in strength and continued progress.\nUsing these strength-skills, I was able to one-arm overhead press and one-arm snatch a 40kg kettlebell and deadlift 170kg which was 2.3x my body weight of 72 kg, and other feats that require extreme whole body strength.\n\n\nBut until now, I have kept many of my top level strength-skills a literal secret, only available to those who train with me in my private strength boot camps and high-level classes.\n\n\nAnyhow, I don’t say this to brag – simply to show you that I know what I am doing, I’ve been perfecting strength development techniques for several years, and I have finally decided to reveal them to you.\nYou will get all the information, exactly what you need to know to build insanely high levels of strength, and built it fast – including exactly how to structure your own program and ready-made programs so you can start straight away.\n\n\nYou can get hold of these Undisclosed Instant Strength Techniques in this course\n+ PDF Download of Every Strength-Skill in the Course - Neuromuscular Strength Notes\n+ PDF Download - The Rules for Strength Development\nOn average you will be learning something new every 1-minute and 20-seconds\nIn the first 4 minutes you'll be stronger with three strength boosting skills\nYou'll know how and why these strength- skills work\nTurn on your body's strength amplifier anytime, anywhere\nImmediately make barbell exercises, pull-ups and one leg squats are easier\nPush through sticking points with ease.\nGoing 'Hyper' Taking strength-skills to the next level\nStacking strength-skills for massive surges in applied strength\nAre your shoes zapping your strength?

      "description": "In this kettlebell course, I will provide you with all the information you need to complete many amazing and results-producing kettlebell workouts from home or in your gym and all you need is one or two kettlebells. Each workout comes with a full-length follow-along video so you can workout along with me. You will have access to step-by-step instructions, and if that is not enough then you can also contact me to ask questions.\nYou can go on to master each workout and make them part of your regular training or you can pick one that suits your needs and include that in your progressional training. The workouts are designed by myself or Anna Junghans and each one has different goals so that you'll have workouts to choose from that suit your needs. It might be one or two workouts for weight loss, cardio, or you might want to work on strength, endurance, flexibility, etc. Whatever it is, there is something for everyone. Most workouts will also have a full or part of a warm-up.\n\n\nDownloadable PDFs\nI'm including some handy downloadable PDFs for those workouts that require more explanation. You can download the PDF to your computer, phone, and/or print them to look at while you perform the workout.\n\n\nDetails and exercises\nWhen it comes to advanced exercises like the Turkish Getup, I include step-by-step instructions and separate videos to cover this exercise. Other exercises you can expect in this course are the clean, press, squat, rows, jerk, swing, deadlift, ribbons, lunge, snatch, curtsy lunge, and much more.\n\n\nBEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, AND ADVANCED\nI would like to stress again that there are workouts in this course that are suitable for everyone, meaning, there will be a workout suitable for a beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, all workouts won't be for everyone, that's the beauty of kettlebell training, there is so much that can be done, and I will present all that in a workout. I will try and make each workout achievable for everyone by including alternatives, but in the end, you'll pick out those that work for you and they'll become your favorite regular kettlebell workout. I have purposely chosen to make one of the most basic kettlebell workouts freely viewable (see lecture W3) so that you can judge whether this is for you or not. To put things in perspective, the 8-minute kettlebell workout on a scale of 1 to 100, 100 being super tough, is a 15 to 20 rating. There are other beginner workouts that reach 30 to 40 on that scale. The ones that reach 100 on that scale are with double kettlebell and super intense for maximum results.\nThere are double kettlebell workouts in this course and I'll try and provide some info on how to do that workout with one bell but I will never be able to satisfy everyone, this is why you can use the Q&A to ask your question on how to adjust it for you.\n\n\nA little bit about me. I'm a qualified kettlebell coach and owner of Cavemantraining with over a decade of kettlebell experience and teaching people, in-person, group format, or online. I understand how to break down complex things and present them in such a way that they are easy to understand and work on.\nA little bit about Anna. Anna is a qualified kettlebell trainer at Cavemantraining with over a decade of kettlebell experience, running group classes, and teaching people in private all over the world.\n\n\nThe workouts challenge all levels, from beginner to advanced as I include alternatives for those workouts that include more advanced exercises, hence, even advanced exercises can be completed by beginners.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nFor those that only have uneven kettlebells and want to complete some of the double kettlebell workouts, you can complete a double kettlebell workout with uneven weights as long as that increment is not too big. You switch sides upon rounds.",

The problem is that you still need to find it. You also must figure out what information is legit and what information is junk... and figuring out the difference can be a full-time job for even the most savvy people.\nSo why waste time “figuring out” what’s good or not when you can sign up for a high-quality course that is organized and delivered in a format that is convenient for you? If you want to learn from and have access to an expert, then this is the course for you.\n\n\nWhat if I don't like the course?\nIt's simple - I'm not happy until you are not happy. Although I did my best in putting up a fitness course that will both educate you and deliver the results you are after, the fact is that we are all quite different.\nI don't want the fear of the unknown to be the determining factor of whether you sign up for a course that could change your life. That's why I want to provide you with a reassurance under the form of a 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee no questions asked. You will have all the time you need to explore the program, try the techniques and see if it's the right fit for you (no pun intended). I have your back long enough for you to see that Fit & Lean delivers amazing results - just like it should.\n\n\nHow long does this fitness course last?\n\nThe length of Fit & Lean is 6 weeks - this period is long enough for you see some great results while also short enough to help you stay on track. During this time you will also develop quality habits in regards to how to eat properly, what exercises to do and what supplements to use. I will teach you all of this in less than 4 hours.\nMany people wrongly go for the longest courses, thinking that this way they get the most bang for their buck. It's not about the length of the course, it's about its quality and the value that will drive to your life. I value your time and that's why Fit & Lean is packed only with the stuff you need in order for you to get what you pay for - RESULTS.\n\n\nDo I still get support after the course?\nAbsolutely! The final lecture of this course doesn’t need to set the end of our friendship. As mentioned numerous times throughout the course, I am here to answer all your questions and help you with your transformation. You will receive exclusive emails (one per week), which will be packed of valuable information that can further boost your progress and assist you in achieving greater results. In other words, you can count on my help and guidance even after completing the course.",

This is the ultimate guide to common leg injuries and how to prevent them!\n** NOW INCLUDING FREE EBOOK - Fundamental Concepts of Sports Coaching\n\n\nLet me tell you, I get SO frustrated when an athlete of mine rolls their ankle. \"Again... are you serious?\".\n\n\nOr have you spent literal hours coming up with an absolutely kick-ass new program, only to find your athletes are starting to get shin splints? How is this fair!\n\n\nSometimes it's hard to find good information out there.\nYou have an understanding of sports coaching but you're looking to be a better coach and get more out of your athletes.\nYour athletes are good... but they could be better.\n\n\nTrust me, I've been there. As a gymnastics coach of 20 years I have a lot of experience training all ages and levels. I often get called on to consult for sporting clubs of all varieties and I am driven to continuously improve my knowledge.\n\n\nSo... I've done the hard work for you.\n\n\nFrom information I have gathered firsthand, from being a coach but ALSO being a healthcare professional (Osteopath), I decided to create this course.\n\n\nWhen I am treating an athlete clinically the biggest problem the coaches I work with have is that they don't understand the injury and don't know what to do with the athlete while they're going through their rehabilitation. That is what this course will address. You will gain an in-depth understanding of common injuries, protective screening tools, rehabilitation and what you can do in training while an athlete is injured.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nAdvanced training concepts relating to injury prevention and sports performance\nAnatomy of the ankle, calf, shin and foot\nTraining concepts relating to strength and flexibility\nHow to biomechanically assess the ankle, calf, shin and foot\nYour role in working with injured athletes as a coach\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE*\nThis course does NOT give you any specific qualification, rather it is intended to be used to improve yourself professionally. If your association allows, you may be able to use it as professional development.\n\n\n* A FEW OF DR. CHARLES' TESTIMONIALS *\n\"A well explained and presented material that will help in your development. [RE: Sports Coaching Certificate Course] Personally I was mostly interested in flexibility and this course surpassed my expectations on this matter. Well done.\" - Jean\n\"Great insight for [a] person with very little experience in sport industry.\" - Wong\n\"As an athletics coach, I found this course really useful and informative. The presentation, videos and explanations were excellent. Highly recommended.\" - Brian\n\"I found this course to be inviting, clear, specific and well presented. Charles’ wealth of knowledge, experience and passion, shines through, leaving no stone unturned. This course is a great attribute for a beginner coach right through to high level coaches. It will give coaches the confidence, to support their athletes, to be the best they can be. I highly recommend this course to any coach who is keen to learn, refresh and fulfil their passion to actively seek the edge in their game.\" - Belinda\n\"I found this course to be very comprehensive and well planned. I will be recommending this course to all our employees. We see there are definite benefits for them personally as well as for the companies OH&S. Great value.\" - Tilo",

Instead of selling you an exercise program, we provide the knowledge you need so you’ll never have to buy an exercise program again! We do this by deconstructing the essential elements of an exercise program, looking at everything from basic anatomy to how long you should rest between sets. We aim to answer a lot of common questions about exercise so you can best structure your workout routines.\nThe principles in this course can be adapted to suit all levels. If anything seems too complicated or difficult, you may not yet be at that level. For people who are relatively inexperienced in the gym or who prefer to work out at home, you can use these techniques for bodyweight or light resistance training.\nHow to Write an Exercise Program answers your workout questions using plain easy-to-understand language. By the end of this course, you will have a much better understanding of the science behind exercise. Using professional methods, you will be able to structure your exercise programs or use your new expertise as a foundation towards a career in the fitness industry.\n\n\nPromotional Video Music Credits\nStrength Of The Titans by Kevin MacLeod",

It was frustrating! During my Yoga teacher training, I discovered that anatomy plays a significant role in flexibility—some people are naturally more flexible, while others, like me, face greater challenges.\n\n\nBut I didn’t let that stop me. Determined to overcome my limitations, I dived into research, studying everything from common barriers to flexibility, to the most effective warm-ups, and stretches.\nThrough this process, I finally achieved the front splits—a milestone I once thought impossible! Along the way, I also noticed improvements in my overall strength, posture, and mobility.\nNow, I want to share what I’ve learned with you.\n\n\n\"Finally Flexible\" is a carefully designed 14-day program that focuses primarily on achieving the front splits, with additional stretches to support progress in the middle splits. Whether you’re just starting out or have been struggling to make progress, this program will guide you step by step to unlock your flexibility, boost confidence, and achieve your goal.\n\n\nJoin me, and let’s work together to make your splits—and your flexibility dreams—a reality!",

It is based on Synergy Sets, a seamless combination of the best resistance training methods. The result are workouts that accomplish in minutes what gym goers spend hours trying to achieve. And you’ll get these results without the same risk of injury that is associated with traditional resistance training methods.\n\n\nAnd, for those of you with a history of resistance training, the Synergy Set approach will change how you understand exercise. It will also fix that joint pain you’ve been struggling with, and bulletproof those joints so you don’t have to worry about them any more.\n\n\nWhat differentiates the Split program from the rest of the Synergy Strength catalog, however, is its flexibility. This program includes four different workout splits—ways to structure your workouts. Alongside these splits, you will find a library of exercise tutorials covering the most effective exercises for each body part, all designed using the Synergy Set approach. The result is endless possibility. You might stick with one split and mix up the exercises each time. Or you might find the exercises you like and change up the split every few weeks.\n\n\nThe result is that you have a lifetime of exercise options in a single program.  Every time things begin to feel a bit stale, you can switch them up, re-energize your routine, and give your progress a boost.\n\nAny program can teach you a workout. This program will teach you how to design your own workouts.",

Or maybe you want to improve your form and technique when you train in a class or on your own?\nDid you know that Pilates  Mat is a form of exercise started by Joseph Pilates?  He was an amazing individual, who wanted to help ballet dancers become stronger and injury free.  He felt that physical strength began with the core muscles of the body.  With this, he designed a series of exercises dedicated to strengthening the \"powerhouse\" of the body, the core.\nWith over 40 years of experience, and as the creator of the YMCA's of America Pilates Mat program, Adita Lang has designed this Pilates Mat Training to teach you the first 15 exercises of the Pilates Mat Work series. You will learn the fundamental knowledge to begin a Pilates mat program or enhance your existing fitness regime.  Each move comes with its own set of rules and modifications, Adita helps you to understand these techniques with your own body.  This will enable you to teach others, or to take your own training to the next level.\nIn this class you will learn the intricacies of 15 exercises, postural and teaching cues, modifications, and programming to create a class or coaching session of your own.\n**If you are a participant wanting to learn better form and technique, this class will help you to enhance your current routine.",

      "description": "A Skinny-Fat Guy or a Gal is someone who has a Higher Body Fat Percentage and relatively Less Muscle Mass.\nI was a classic example of a skinny fat person.\nI was somewhere close to 26% body fat with a decent amount of lean muscle.\nHere are some of the Exact mistakes I made that resulted me being Skinny-Fat:\nDo you relate to any of these mistakes?\nMistake No #1: I decided to Gain Muscle even though my body fat was somewhere around 20%\nWhen a guy who has a body fat percentage around that mark, he is more predisposed to gaining even more fat when trying to gain lean muscle.\nLet me explain.\nYou see if you have a higher body fat percentage you’ll have a higher insulin sensitivity. What this does is you gain more fat than muscle when trying to bulk up. Ultimately my body fat increased from 20% to 26% and I lost muscle in the process:(\nMistake No #2: I ate close to 4,000 calories everyday.\nI had only one desire and that was to gain lot of muscle. It was clear to me at that time that if you need to get Big you need to eat big, Period! I convinced myself that I can cut down all the body fat down once I gain enough muscle (the typical bodybuilding way)\nSo I did. I didn't counted my calories (although I had a rough idea and it was close to 4,000). You’ll be even more surprised to know that I ate pretty clean. I did had my cheat meals and use to drink socially at the time. But you see your body doesn't need so many calories to build lean muscle, it only requires marginally more than your maintenance! The extra 1000-1200 calories thats I ate accumulated as body fat. Yes, even eating extra healthy food can get deposited as Belly Fat, like it or not!\nMistake No #3: I was in the Gym almost everyday busting my ass.\nWhen it came to my workouts, I was in the gym almost everyday. This instead, resulted me in losing lean muscle instead of gaining them. Muscles are build when you rest and recover. The simple fact was that I was overtraining.\nBesides these mistakes there are also some ‘Common Mistakes’ that people make that causes them to become Skinny-Fat:\n-Do chronic cardio everyday & Eat way less than your Maintenance calories. This strips away all your lean muscle. And when you get off your starvation diet, you gain all the weight back mainly around the belly area. In 99% cases more weight (fat not muscle) than what you have lost.\n-Little or no weight training. This one is pretty obvious. No weight training = No Lean Muscle.\nI created ‘LEAN’ because I don’t want you to repeat the same mistakes I did and waste your Precious Years!\nThe FOCUS of this Course is : BODY-RECOMPOSITION i.e. Target Belly Fat & Build Lean Muscle at the same time.\nBut do so, in a very intelligent manner i.e. cycling through Three Different Phases over the course of 18 weeks.\nHere’s what you’ll get with LEAN-The Ultimate Skinny-Fat Solution Course:\n3-Phase LEAN Workout Plans\nEach Phase aka The Destroyer, The Preserver & The Booster are 6 weeks long! They all serve a unique purpose and are specifically designed to do just that.\nYou’ll be only working out with weights 3 times a week! No more!\nTotal time commitment with LEAN fitness routine is no more than 6 hours a week! That’t not even 5% of your entire week.\n3-Phase LEAN Calorie-Counted Weekly Nutrition & Diet Plans\nEvery meal, every calorie, counted for you! No Guesswork.\nHigh Protein Meals, Low Carb Meals, Indian Meals, Mediterranean or Continental menu are all provided.\nAre you a Non-Vegetarian and still prefer protein supplements? You are covered. [Or]\nAre you a Vegetarian who prefer to workout without using protein supplements? Don't worry you are covered too!\nBonus-1: LEAN-The Nutrition Guide\nThis nutrition guide contains more than 40 mouth watering recipes—both main meals & snacks, most of which I personally cook and consume! Further, exact steps on how to calculate your TDEE, nutritional tips, supplementation guidelines, and a shopping list are all included in this guide.\nBonus 2: LEAN-Tracker Sheets\nDaily Meal Tracker, Weekly Goals Tracker and Goal Analysis Sheets etc are given to keep you accountable and motivated throughout the program.\nBonus 3: Unlimited Access to Premium Content At No Extra Cost To You for Next 12 Months\n\nI am obsessed about progression. Be it my physique, my mind or my programs/courses. As I create more content for LEAN it will be automatically added to your account completely at NO cost to you.\n\nThink about this…..\nJust ONE session with a personal trainer will set your wallet aback by ($25-$75) depending upon where in the world you reside!\nTrain with him/her for just 3 months (3 times a week) and you are looking at a bill of $1000 or more.\nLEAN will only cost you $65 for Lifetime Access! That’s just $2.7/week. [ LEAN PRO is a 24 week program]\nYes, just $2.7 a week!\nFor a program that is a result of my ‘over a decade of research’ through trails and errors and by spending thousands of thousands of dollars on the best certifications, scientific books, journals, and then relentlessly applying the strategies, tools and philosophies on myself and hundreds of the clients I trained both at my health club and otherwise ……\nWhy Am I literally giving it away for so cheap? My Answer is real simple….\nMy Mission is to reach out to millions of people and help them save time, effort & their hard-earned money from the mis-information. I just don't want them to make the same mistakes I made.\nI want everyone reading this to be able to afford it comfortably.\nBuilding your ‘Fabulous’ Physique doesn’t have to be expensive.\nGive LEAN a try for 30 Days and see if it works for you or not.\nYour Friend & Coach,\nAkash",

You will learn the fundamentals and get answers to questions that are frequently asked, yet never answered fully or satisfactorily. For example:\nIs it possible to build muscle, gain size whilst getting leaner all at the same time?\nWhat’s the best way to train and eat to maximise muscle growth?\nWhat if I’m not looking to get bigger, just much stronger?\n\n\nOften, it takes one to hit a training plateau or unfortunately get injured before they really start to seek the serious answers. If you, like many others, want to identify the factors that go into optimizing your hypertrophy or strength training to see optimal results, then these lectures will provide the information for just that.\n\n\nRemember, there is a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee.

      "description": "Vegan Bodybuilding Masterclass (2021) - The Complete Guide to Building the Ultimate Vegan Body\n***Best Selling Course***\nThis course is for Vegans and for those who are considering becoming vegan, who want a complete, practical and step by step approach to getting ripped, where everything is made clear to both understand and implement right away.\n\n\n\nHave you ever struggled to bulk up as a vegan?\nHave you been told that you need to eat meat to gain mass?\nWould you like to go vegan but are worried about losing your gains?\n\n\nIf you want a simple proven approach to bulking, cutting and maintaining on a vegan diet, then this is the course for you.  Covering training, nutrition, goal setting and mindset, it's the course for anyone who wants a one stop shop to learning all that is needed to getting ripped on a vegan diet..\nIt’s not for you if you’re looking for extensive biomedical explanations as to why the method works, if you believe in ‘Bro Science’, or if you believe that you can't build muscle on a vegan diet and don't want to be shown otherwise\nWhy do some people who stick to a plan get minimal gains... or even none, whilst others build incredible bodies with consistent gains?\nThere are a few fundamentals which if done consistently over time will lead you to the body of your dreams, guaranteed.  The difficulty is sifting through all the industry BS to know exactly what these fundamentals are.  The process of getting ripped has been massively over-complicated to help companies sell more magazines and supplements.  If it wasn’t like this these companies would go out of business as there is no way you could fill a whole magazine each month with new discoveries about basic training principles that have been around for hundreds of years.\nThis course takes what has been made into a complicated subject and lays it out in plain and simple terms, providing a framework that anyone can take and apply to their own circumstances, to achieve their body goals.\n\n\nHere are 5 reasons why you should take the course:\nLearn a proven approach to training, that you can apply to your own workouts right away, even without access to a gym.\nLearn the keys to creating Bulking, Cutting and Maintenance Nutrition Plans that Leave You Feeling Satisfied, Nourished and Energetic.\nDiscover the TOP 5 Myths and Mistakes that are Ruining Your Results Right Now and you don't even know it.\nMaster Your Inner-game, Self-Discipline, and Make Your Determination Explode\nIdentify Destructive Behaviours that are Stopping You from Achieving your goals, and Replace them with Habits of Success\n\n\nHere are some reasons why you might not take the course:\nYou have that niggling sense of doubt that we all get before we make a purchase - The course comes with Udemys 30 day 100% money back guarantee so rest assured there's absolutely no risk on your part.\nThere are other courses on the subject - I believe this is the most comprehensive all-in one course on vegan bodybuilding on Udemy and online.  In many cases, you have to purchase multiple courses from an instructor to cover the whole subject.  Not here, everything’s included including access to me.\nYou’ve seen a negative review - The course is a living, breathing organism and I update it regularly.  Whenever I receive feedback that I can use to improve the course, I do. As you will see from the comment & ratings below I reach out to students to learn more about both positive and negative experiences.  I want you to enjoy the course as much as I did creating it. If you are any less than 5* satisfied I encourage you to refund your investment with Udemys 100% money back guarantee.\nYou’re not sure if the course is right for you - The course provides a complete framework that you can apply to your own individual circumstances. It teaches principles that have been proven to work, time and time again.  Rather than showing you how to perform bicep curls, it gives you the principles behind the types of exercises that get you the most bang for your buck. The same with nutrition. I show you the kinds of nutrition (what kinds of carbs/fats etc) that work and why. I show you what I eat, and I show you how you can design your own nutrition plan that satisfies your own personal needs. I don’t give you a generic ‘one size fits all’ meal plan because we all have individual tastes, wants and needs.\n***Important*** The course gives you the knowledge you need to build your own programme. In the course I treat you like an adult that has the ability to take principles, and then apply them to your own circumstances and goals.  One of the keys to getting ripped long term is being proactive in making your regimen work for you. If you’re looking to get ripped with zero pro-activeness on your part, the course isn't for you and I recommend that you don't take it.\n\n\nHere’s what students are saying:\n“This course is so great because it is universal. It does not show you how to curl your biceps, but describes the mechanisms which work, so that you can work out the details for yourself and still get the results. This is exactly the knowledge I was looking for.”\n“I have been training for about 1,5 years and after going through this course making notes i can see how much i have been doing wrong. I am confident and looking forward to seeing greater results than i have been before.”\nI've tried many different workout plans and different diets and I suck at all of them.. Mainly because there are so many things to do.. I like this training , because he takes out all the hype and BS and just gives the basics you should do. plan and easy..”\n“Learning a lot basic stuffs from it. As a beginner this is the course of my choice. Thanks to the instructor for designing this amazing course. I pray and wish I could gain muscle following this course.”\n\n\nIf you’re ready to go vegan, take control of your gains and finally achieve the body you’ve always wanted then enroll now and I’ll see you inside!\nMichael",

      "description": "Through this course, we will take a research based approach to lower back pain relief. It is estimated that 80% of Americans will suffer from lower back pain. The primary cause of lower back pain is poor postural patterns caused by tight muscles. The Corrective Exercise approach to lower back pain is a Research based 3 Step system: Relax, Lengthen, and Strengthen.\nThe first stage is to relax tight muscles. In this video, we demonstrate how to use a technique called \"Self Myo-fascial\" release to relax muscles that are tight or \"over active\". We use specific tools to relieve the muscle tension such as tennis balls and a foam roll.\nOnce we relaxed the tight muscles aggravating the back, we move to the Lengthening stage. In this stage, we focus on specific stretches to target over active muscles.  The stretches will lengthen the tight muscles to a proper length and tension.\n\nOur final phase is to strengthen muscles that are too weak or \"under active\". In this phase we focus on strengthening all parts of the core and developing strength through the hips as well. We end with a functional and dynamic exercise to teach the body to move together with proper mechanics.\nThis video is based on Research and you will experience the results.\nThank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon,\nMatthew Tanoue CES, PES, cPT",

      "description": "The Problem with Working Out and Eating Right\n\nFinding the time to workout and eat right can be a HUGE inconvenience to you and your schedule. Who has the time to spend 5-10 hours per week in the gym anyway?\nPlus, that doesn't even include the 1-2 hours per day that you could spend in the kitchen steaming broccoli and boiling chicken. Gross!\nWhat about the raw cost of having a gym membership, fitness classes, and a personal training?\nThe True cost of Your Health\nSo how do you lose weight, lose body fat, and get ripped without spending your valuable time, and THOUSANDS of dollars on...\n\nA gym membership: $40-$149/month\nFitness classes: $180-$349/month\nPersonal training: $60-$100/session. *(Typically at 2-4 sessions per week to see results)\nSemi-private training: $20-$40/session. *(Also recommended 2-4 sessions per week)\n**Keep in mind, most people need at LEAST 8-12 months of training to get to their goals and make this a habit.**\n\n\nSee how this can all start to add up?\nDon't get me wrong here, I believe that your health and your body is absolutely worth it. Treating your body right with the proper diet and exercise program isn't just a means of losing weight, getting a ripped physique, and showing off your six pack abs.\nExercise and eating right can save you tens or HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars over the years on doctors appointments, physical therapists, medications, and even surgeries.\n\"\nSo what's the solution here? Is there a legitimate weight loss and fat loss solution that doesn't take up so much time and dry out your bank account?\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Ideal Strategy for Weight Loss and Fat Loss\nThe optimal time to workout and make healthy decisions for your weight loss goals is first thing in the morning.\nAnd the best place to workout, is in the comfort of your own home. Seriously! All you need is a little space in your house, and your own body weight to exercise. No equipment required!\nBy kicking off your morning with a brief, intense workout and a healthy breakfast, you'll be 2-3x more likely to eat healthier and make healthier decisions throughout the rest of your busy day.\n\nAnd within a month, you will lose 4-10 pounds.\nAnd after that month, you will lose more weight, and those decisions will start to become habits.\nAnd after 4-6 months, those habits will become a lifestyle. You will lose weight, lose stubborn belly fat, and transform your body.\n\n\nThat's when weight loss becomes EFFORTLESS!\n\nBy performing just one 15 minute circuit training workout in the morning, and following it up with a healthy breakfast, that stubborn weight and fat will just start falling off of you.\n\n\n**\"Can You Really lose Weight and Belly Fat With 15 Minute Workouts?\"**\nAbsolutely! Here's why...\nBy starting off your day with a series of batched, healthy habits you are going to be inspired and motivated to make healthy choices throughout the rest of you day, and that's the true key to weight loss.\nIt's all about getting every day started on the right foot!\n\nYou will want to eat a healthy breakfast, lunch, and dinner so that you don't wreck your progress, and that alone will help you lose several pounds of fat every month.\nPlus, working out in the morning is going to help you...\nIncrease your energy for the rest of the day\nBuild lean muscle tissue and increase your resting metabolism\nMake you a happier, more positive, more productive human being!\nKeeping it Simple Will Make You Successful\nLet me let you in on a little something. I have trained 100+ clients in person, and over 30,000 online.\n95% of all of my clients and customers want to lose weight and look incredible, but don't have the time, money, or resources to lose fat and make that change.\nWant to know what has made them successful? Simplicity!\n\nSmall changes\nSimple Diets\nBrief, intense workouts that you can do at home (or anywhere!)\nHow This Course Will Change Your Life\nHere's just a little idea of how small, healthy changes can make a massive difference. This is a review that Paul W. left me after taking one of my other health and fitness courses.\n\"I know the title sounds a bit over-the-top but it is actually true. I'm one of those people that Jack mentions in the course who don't have time to exercise so I decided to give his 10 day food challenge a go. It went so well for me I decided to stick with it. I've been going for 7 weeks now and I've lost just over 6 kilos (about 12 pounds) and counting. Without any exercise whatsoever. I got rid of processed foods, I eat very little dairy now (I can't resist a bit of cheese every now and again!), I make decent healthy snacks to eat during the day, make sure I have breakfast every day, drink plenty of water and green tea and it has made a huge difference. I feel better and have more energy but most of all, the weight is coming off. I haven't set any mad targets, I see this as a lifestyle change rather than a diet, I'm looking at it long term. I don't want to be in shape just for summer. I want it to be a permanent thing. I know that at some point I will need to do some exercise to get all the weight off but it's going to be so much easier with the start I've got from Jack's plan.\"\n-Paul W.\n\nThe best parts about Paul's story is that he didn't even workout! He just made small changes to his daily routine, and used a similar diet to the one I include in this course.\nThink about how much weight you will be able to lose on this program by adding 15 minute workouts to your morning.\nLook at the time and money that you are going to save by using this program, instead of going to the gym and hiring a trainer.\nWhat's the risk?\n\n\nTry this Course 100% Risk Free\n\nThe answer is, there is none! You can try this 15 minute morning routine course for 30 days, and if you aren't happy with your results you can get 100% of your money back.\nIf this isn't the right weight loss and fat loss solution for you, I want you to find one that is, even if it isn't mine.\nOtherwise, if this sounds like the perfect weight loss solution for you all you have to do it click \"take this course\" and we'll get started.\nI can't wait to hear from you!\n\n-Jack",

To some, the fear of falling may seem trivial. Yet to the 65+ age group, this can be a stressful thing.\nStudies show that people who fall during their senior years are much more prone to injury and sometimes even death. Many older people wonder if it’s possible to improve their balance and also get stronger so that they’ll be more stable. Should they accidentally trip or slip, their bodies would be more resilient and they will be able to handle the impact.\nThis is a sensitive topic and definitely warrants much attention. The hard truth is that people do not become physically unstable or unbalanced as they age. Of course, there is no denying that a certain degree of strength and mobility is lost.\nBe an expert with Zayra Mo who will teach you the best moves and routines for Stability and Balance in a progressive way and the cues of posture which you can integrate in any class format and also you'll learn from these routines:\nBreathing Exercises\nChair Stretching or Chair Yoga\nStability\nBalance\nCoordination\nand much more!\nAlso this program come with the BONUS of Stability Workshop\nAnd at the end, you can request our Special Diploma - besides Udemy - which you can showcase in your portfolio, office or social media.\nThis is a great opportunity to learn from Zayra Mo who is been teaching Yoga, Chair Yoga, Meditation, Fitness and more to Active Adults in the last five years.\nThe video routines are in ENGLISH AND SPANISH!",

But what if I told you that the art of brandishing is not just about the ability to create spectacular effects? There are other reasons and advantages for mastering it too, and it takes your saber mastery to another level. By correctly managing posture and centre of gravity, is possibile perform dynamic moves that become art, expertise and true spectacles, from which offensive and defensive potential are also created by those who really have full control of their saber.\nThrough this course you’ll undertake an immediate and entertaining learning path which will help master even the most difficult techniques. Thanks to visual aid and simple and direct language, you’ll manage to understand and execute the techniques taught in a simple, intuitive way.\nYou will learn Brandishing, an effective, sophisticated and spectacular fencing training that brings several benefits to both athletes or practitioners of fencing and other sports.\nBrandishing gets every part of the body involved and is, de facto, a training form with both aerobics and functional components. It will help you improve your coordination, reactivity and equilibrium. From a technical point of view, it will augment confidence with sword handling, this means your ability to optimize your movements, understanding the leverage effects of the hilt and the fundamental role of finger mobility. Through brandishing you’ll also learn how to make your sword move smoothly and effectively in space.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, you will able to:\nCreate spectacular movements with your Light Saber;\nFully control your saber, regardless of the style or technique applied during combat;\nAchieve the highest level of confidence with your saber, so that you can control it expertly, even in the most complex situations, and learning to use it as if it was just a true extension of your own arm;\nPredict your saber’s reactions so that you can safely manage balance, characteristics and reactivity;\nCreate flowing, rapid, safe but less predictable transitions, in order to expertly move from one action to another;\nLink several attack and defence movements together to build offensive and defensive sequences when having fun with your friends.\nLearn new techniques to make your scenic combat performances more realistic and create original choreographies of great impact, thanks to the presence of alternating theoretical and practical lessons that will allow you to immerse yourself in the dynamic combat scenario;\nBecome a part of an international network and have the possibility of validating your skills to be able to take part in LudoSport circuit competitions;\nLearn a new form of LudoSport combat from zero (if you don't know LudoSport or if you are part of an academy where this technique is not yet available);\nAdd to your knowledge and training (if you are already a Brandish course pupil);\nUse the online lessons to go over what you already know whenever and wherever you want to (if you are pupil of the subsequent forms);\nHave an interactive reference always on hand to help you with your lesson plan (if you are an instructor);\n\nThe techniques and exercises showed in the video lessons must be considered a supplement to LuduSport’s Sport Light Saber Fencing styles, which are brought into competition by athletes members of our International Network. LudoSport techniques form a complete fencing system, divided in 9 Light Saber Combat Forms.\n\n\nCourse characteristics:\nThe course is a manual that you will always have on hand, that you can consult from any device, anywhere and at any time of day;\nIt contains practical exercises, slow motion videos and details that allow you to put what you have learnt into practice and actually tangibly improve your technique!\nIt is filmed with full HD Video: High resolution graphics and original soundtrack. We are committed to providing the highest quality audio-visual support to ensure an optimal experience for our students;\nYou will be awarded an end-of-course certificate: At the end of the course, you will receive a certificate for having completed the training and congratulations from all the Ludosport Evolve team and the Founding Masters.\n\n\nWhat you will actually learn:\nRIN: the simplest movement, which hides the basis of the ability to manage the movement generated by the fingers and wrists;\nCROSSING RIN: the fascination generated by a classical transition, whose fluid and continuous movement always amazes the observer;\nNIR: speed and control, the power of this sequence translates into a base to bring very effective attacks;\nHELIX: to learn how to express energy, elegance and rhythm\nWAVE: a classic, present in many disciplines with cutting weapons, adapted to the particular physical characteristics of the Light Saber for sports fighting;\nAEREAL TRICK: let your saber... fly!\n\n\nThese are all elements that will allow you perform dynamic moves that become art, expertise and true spectacles!\n\n\nLUDOSPORT OVERVIEW\n\nThe birth of LudoSport\nSporting Light Saber Combat is an original sporting discipline created and codified by Simone Spreafico, Gianluca Longo and Fabio Monticelli starting from 2005 and regularly carried out as part of a teaching system named “LudoSport” from 2006.\n\n\nThis sport\nIs inspired and created all its techniques using an imaginary weapon with a blade of pure energy that can cut everything except itself, in any direction:\nIt is a form of combat, therefore based on competition;\nIt is a form of sporting combat, therefore inspired by clear, structured rules and principles.\n\n\nSporting Light Saber Combat is divided into several combat forms, known as “Styles”, that differ from each other but that are perfectly compatible when executed and used with each other: each of them can be used in combat with the others.\nTeaching is structured with a progression in the complexity and physical commitment required, to allow easy learning for anyone as a part of a gradual path.\n\n\nOur principles\nSporting Light Saber Combat was conceived and is promoted each day in observance of the principles of loyalty, discipline, fair play, respect, passion and a sense of belonging that characterise the sport in the modern Olympic ideal.\n\nOn this matter, LudoSport has defined its own key rule, Se.Cu.Ri. (Servizio, Cura, Rispetto - Service, Care, Respect):\nServizio is each athlete’s willingness to support all their companions on a path to technical improvement;\nCura is shown through the control exercised in techniques and in general attention to not harming our companions;\nRispetto comes from self-awareness, awareness of our strengths and weaknesses, and leads to a correct way of interacting with others, in the awareness that we must not underestimate anyone, whatever their rank or experience.\n\n\nThe technical execution of movements requires specific control training.\nIn our sport, we do not use protection excessively as, by limiting freedom of movement, they also limit our freedom of expression.\nWe are not medieval knights in suits of shiny armour, we do not like masks as they hide the face of those competing in the arena, and we also believe that excessive protections may - even subconsciously - provide a psychological justification of an almost random use of the athlete's saber: “Well, my opponent is protected by padding”.\nWe do not intend light saber fencing to be an unsightly brawl. Control is at the very heart of truly mastering our saber and guarantees sensible, technical movements. This is why practising control is essential for us, and when practised correctly, it allows us to drive our blade forward at 140 km/hour in a fraction of a second, and then stop it exactly where and when we want.\nAll our members are appreciated for the quality of their performance rather than for any victory they may achieve. All genuine desires to work together for their companions and the society are also rewarded.\nLudoSport guarantees a real situation of equal opportunities for all Light Saber Combat athletes, where race, age, gender, different skills, social and economic class, political and religious beliefs are never prejudiced.\nUsing the meticulous educational research conducted by its Masters, LudoSport has also driven its own founding principles to the point of being able to accommodate disabled people, proving that sport can truly overcome any physical barriers.\n\n\nWhy is LudoSport right for you?\n\n\nRight from the start, LudoSport aimed to be an excellence in the realm of sporting innovation.\nThanks to the serene environment created in each of its structures, LudoSport creates a positive context for promoting and sustaining an ethical culture in sport, involving both its instructors and athletes, creating an atmosphere that stimulates consistent behaviour and respect for all those involved.\nThanks to its founding rules, the sport transmits the message of respect in all forms and opportunities. In this way, the sport is always dominated by behaviour based on fair play, sharing and mutual help.\nThe play and sporting sides of the sport offered by LudoSport are favourable to mental and physical well-being, protecting the athletes’ fundamental right to take part in a sport where competition is healthy and not negative for those involved.\nLudoSport favours and promotes socialising within its structure, both during the sporting activities and also outside of training, creating positive contexts for spending time together and giving everyone a role, regardless of the level of technical preparation they have achieved. The educational value of “merit” is also included in a social value, rewarding personal initiatives that are helpful for members as a whole.\n\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

Just one hour a week is the most you'll ever need.\n\nI know because it's what I used to get into the best shape of my life at the age of 40, with two young kids, while working more than full-time.\n\nI needed the most efficient workout in the world. So, I researched, iterated, and created exactly that.\n\nYou might be asking how this is possible.\n\nThis program combines only the most effective exercise methodologies in a synergistic way to create high intensity workouts that, despite pushing nearly every muscle you've got to failure, only take minutes to complete.\n\nIt comes down to consistently applying the safest and most effective methodologies with intelligence and intensity.\n\nAnd the best part is that you won't just get a four-month, phased program, you'll get a blueprint for how to create your own programs. Because this isn't just a program, it's a system for getting results. And, as a professional teacher, I designed the curriculum so that you'll do the workouts, get the results, and learn the system.\n\nI don't just want you to look good and be healthy. I want you to be independent. So, I designed the last last exercise program you'll ever need to buy.\nHere's what you'll get:\n- A four-phase, four-month exercise program that you can do entirely at home regardless of how busy you are\n- Nutritional guidance including what and how much to eat while doing the program\n- Two easy ways to track your progress so you can watch yourself get stronger and slimmer\n- Over six hours of video instruction including all of the exercises and follow along workouts\n- A guide to the very few high return supplements including dosage recommendations\n- The knowledge and elements needed to design a lifetime's worth of exercise programs\nThis is a truly one-of-a-kind exercise program. I'm not a fitness influencer. I'm not trying to sell you my supplements or a membership to my gym.

      "description": "Welcome! I am Niamh Condron, your instructor today, and I'm going to tell you about your new course!\nHere you have five classes of Ballet Barre Pilates, a unique fusion that will work out your body in ways that few other exercise classes can. Each class is one hour long, combing Pilates, Ballet Barre and a little cardio, to make up a well rounded, body sculpting, fitness course. The classes will lift your energy levels and increase your range of motion while giving you a beautiful posture. These 5 lessons are low-impact exercise classes, meaning they are easy to follow and suitable for all levels and ages.\nTo start, you will need a chair in the place of a Ballet Barre, and a Pilates or Yoga mat to sit and lie on. Don't worry if you have never done Ballet before in your life! We are working out using manageable, yet highly effective, ballet exercises that you can follow and benefit from. Wear comfortable clothes and make sure you have enough space to stretch out. You are going to feel lean, long and strong!\nWe begin each class warming up the entire body and loosening away any tensions. Using the back of the chair as a Ballet barre, we learn Ballet technique sequences that engage your core, legs, back and arms. These sequences are low-impact strengthening exercises that lead you to becoming centered, balanced and agile.\nA variety of the Ballet sequences we are learning are rhythmical and musical, and always clearly developed. This rhythmical repetition of movement helps with weight loss and also results in a calming of the mind and an increased body-breath awareness. This also feels quite like fun and raises your vibration!\nOpening the shoulders and correcting postural habits is a priority in this course, especially considering that we are all spending way too much time on our phones these days! I'll be teaching you how to relax and let go of any stress that may be lingering anywhere around the face or upper body. When you learn to let go of unnecessary tensions, you will feel lighter and your movements will become more and more graceful. Just like a dancer!\nThe incorporated Pilates work builds your abdominals and creates a healthy spine and neck. We are learning how to tone the upper arms, wrists, and upper back. We are stretching out the lower back area and sides while creating strength around the waist. With this development of strength you will be finding more possibility in your body to access a fuller range of mobility that will assist your Ballet work. Plus, you will feel freer in your daily activities as you go about the rest of your day, and week.\nBy training in Pilates, we tone the essential body areas needed to be able to free and lift the chest area, and relax the neck and shoulders. Your energy will rise and your unique essence will start to shine through your skin.\nWhen we think of Ballet, we think of the hips! Yes, there are plenty of deep squats and inner leg stretches! We are opening the hips and loosening the top of the legs in an effort to move towards increased flexibility. Also building strength in the inner thighs, calves and ankles to prepare for a little jumping. Warning! There is a little cardio and endurance work in each class! Just a little and it's totally manageable. Hooray!\nDuring your Ballet Barre Pilates course, you will work out your feet, discover the possible range of movement they have and you will learn how to stretch your toes. We are creating stability from the ground up. Happy feet! You will feel taller by the end of the course, strong and lengthened, with your feet standing firmly on the ground!\nEnjoy and have fun while learning!\nSee you there,\n- Niamh",

During tabata training, burning of fat occurs not only during workout, but also continues after training due to post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) effect, so you keep burning calories.\n\n\nThis course consists of 3 full-fledged home workouts of 30 minutes each, including warm-up, rest between sets and a cool-down after a workout, so you don't need to pause video to have rest nor invent anything extra.\n\n\nTo achieve the best results (which you are aiming for, otherwise you would not be interested in this course), I advise you to do the first Tabata Abs workout №1 three times in the first week, the second Tabata Abs workout №2 in the second week and the third Tabata Abs workout №3 in the third week.\n\n\nYou'll get an opportunity to develop core strength, increase your endurance, lose weight and make a habit of training regularly.\n\n\nIn case you have any cardiovascular, other serious health conditions or any doubt, do not start this course without approval from your treating physician!\n\n\nI wish you good luck in reaching your goals!",

With supersets, you perform the first set of the second exercise right after completing the first set of the first exercise, before doing the second set of the first exercise.\nwhich is a great way to save time without sacrificing the gains, It increases the intensity of the workout while reducing the time it takes to execute it, making it in some ways more effective.\nThe workout itself will take about 30 minutes to finish, like for example if you have work at 9 am, you hit the gym at 8 am you do the workout you take a shower have a quick snake or a protein shake and at 9 am you will be at your work.\nWish you all the best have a nice day.",

Stretching every day can stop the premature effects of prolonged sitting. Fit and Flexible stretching course is made up of three full length stretching sequences; Standing, on the mat and with a chair to build back your flexibility. Each sequence has twelve to fourteen simple postures to learn. The focus of this course isn't about learning difficult postures but to integrate these simple easy postures into your daily life so that will make lasting changes to your body. These stretches are easy for beginners with suggested progressions that are also good for intermediate students.  This could be a good reminder for the more advanced students who aren't stretching.  To support these three sequences each individual stretch is included in a separate video of 3-7 minutes so that you learn the stretch well and the shorter videos are good for when you have less time in the day to stretch. Included is a written description with instructions  on how to execute the stretch properly. If you have any doubts about any stretch please consult your doctor and remember that lasting change happens when you practice every day.",

It focuses on building the muscles most responsible for the hourglass shape, while shrinking and tightening your waist.\nThere's so much fitness content aimed at women that will have you doing ab exercises, high repetition burn sets, and cardio calisthenics like burpees. These exercises are, at best, a waste of time and, in many cases, counterproductive. If you want a thick waist with protruding abs, keep doing those ab exercises. If you want overuse injuries in your joints, high repetition burn sets will get you there. If you want to lost your curves and get fatter as a percentage of your overall body weight, cardio is your best bet.\nIf, however, you want your dream figure in just minutes a week, you've come to the right program.\nIt includes no traditional ab exercises, high rep sets, or cardio.\nIt is the distillation of 20 years of experience in the health and fitness space and provides a unique approach to exercise that you won't find anywhere else.\nIt is the Synergy Strength system--combining the safest, most effective and efficient exercise methodologies to create workouts that will get you into shape in only 10-15 minutes two to three times a week.\nYou're probably thinking this sounds too good to be true. A couple of years I would have agreed with you. But, I invite you to check the reviews for a my other workout programs. You'll find testimonials from people who are getting better results in a third of the time, while enjoying more energy and fewer injuries. These are people who now have more time for their families, their hobbies, their lives.\nInside this program, you will find a selection of five different full body workouts, none of which require any specialized workout equipment other than a single resistance band. But, you will also find an entire exercise system that will provide you with the tools and knowledge to take your fitness into your own hands for the rest of your life. In addition, the course covers everything you need to know about nutrition and recovery, because without addressing these, you are attempting to climb a mountain on one leg.\nEvery once in awhile, too good to be true is exactly as advertised. This is one of those times. Isn't it about time you enjoyed the body of your dreams?",

      "description": "Course Introduction: Discover the Power of Tai Chi – Meditation in Motion\n“One of the Best 5 Exercises You Can Ever Do”\n– Harvard Medical School, Harvard Health Publishing\nTai Chi (Taiji), often described as “meditation in motion” or “moving yoga,” is ranked #2 among the top five exercises recommended by Harvard Health, just behind swimming. According to Harvard Medical School, these top five exercises include:\nSwimming\nTai Chi\nStrength Training\nWalking\nKegel Exercises (for pelvic floor strength)\nUnlike other workouts that isolate either strength, balance, or flexibility, Chen Style Tai Chi – the original and oldest style of Tai Chi – integrates all of them, including many movements that provide similar benefits as strength training, walking, and pelvic floor exercises. Why not give it a try? Learn a lifelong skill, boost your brainpower, and take on our 30-Day Challenge to complete this course!\nThe Origins of Tai Chi\nTai Chi (Taijiquan) is a traditional Chinese martial art that originated over 300 years ago in Chenjiagou, Henan Province—just 70km from the hometown of your instructor, David Yao.\nIt’s believed that a martial artist from the Chen family, inspired by the symbol of Yin and Yang where two rivers merged, created this powerful system of movement. Rooted in the principles of Taoism and Confucianism, Tai Chi reflects a philosophy of harmony between mind, body, and nature.\nWhat Makes Chen Style Unique?\nChen Style is the mother of all Tai Chi styles, characterized by:\nSpiral movements called “silk reeling”\nA balance of slow, meditative motion and bursts of explosive power\nAn emphasis on internal energy flow (Qi) and postural awareness\nGentle yet powerful martial applications\nThis course offers you authentic, foundational training in Chen Style Tai Chi, suitable for beginners and adaptable for all fitness levels.\nWhy Tai Chi? Benefits for Life\nTai Chi offers comprehensive benefits for both mind and body:\nImproves balance and flexibility\nEnhances mental focus and emotional calm\nBuilds strength without straining joints\nStrengthens lungs and supports cardiovascular health\nBoosts cognitive function and neuroplasticity\nImproves posture and body alignment\nReduces stress, anxiety, and supports overall well-being\nUnlike high-impact exercises, Tai Chi is low-impact, adaptable, and safe for all ages, including older adults or those recovering from injury. You perform fluid, circular movements at your own pace, integrating breathing, meditation, and awareness.\nA Holistic System of Wellness\nChen Style Tai Chi is more than a martial art—it is a holistic practice based on:\nYin and Yang Theory\nThe Five Elements\nTraditional Chinese Medicine principles\nGuided breathing (Qigong)\nAncient movement wisdom similar to Yoga or Pilates\nThese integrated elements make Tai Chi a truly internal and external workout, cultivating both physical vitality and inner peace.\nReady to Begin?\nNo matter your current fitness level, Tai Chi welcomes you. With consistent practice, you can:\nDiscover a new cultural tradition\nMaster a new skill\nDevelop grace, strength, and serenity\nImprove your overall health for life\nTake the 30-Day Tai Chi Challenge and experience transformation—one gentle move at a time.\nMedical Disclaimer\nThe information provided through Tai Chi Fitness and affiliated platforms including Udemy and YouTube, is intended for educational and informational purposes only.

      "description": "Boost Testosterone For Increased Sex Drive Muscle Growth, Fat Loss & Fitness | Hormone Health, Balance & Happiness\nTestosterone is considered to be the \"male hormone\" that's produced in men by the testes. Although women's ovaries produce some testosterone, the hormone is produced in much higher concentrations in men and it is responsible for many of the secondary sex characteristics seen in men such as a deeper voice and hair on the chest, in addition to contributing to a healthy libido, building muscle mass, and maintaining energy levels.\nHow to boost testosterone naturally? There are many misconceptions when it comes to testosterone. Some people connect it with aggressive behavior; some believe that the more testosterone a man has, the more “macho” he is. In any case, there are men who want to have as much testosterone in their system as possible. Luckily, it's not that difficult.\nThis course include a simple, quick, and inexpensive method that you can use today to boost\nyour testosterone level\nSome men have low testosterone levels. This is called Testosterone Deficiency Syndrome (TD) or Low Testosterone (Low-T). Deficiency means that the body does not have enough of a needed substance. Syndrome is a group of symptoms that, together, suggest a disease or health condition.\nSpecific Signs/Symptoms of Testosterone Deficiency (TD)\nSpecific symptoms are those more likely or directly linked to TD such as:\n· Reduced sex drive\n· Reduced erectile function\n· Loss of body hair\n· Less beard growth\n· Loss of lean muscle mass\n· Feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)\n· Obesity (being overweight)\n· Symptoms of depression\nNon-specific Signs/Symptoms of Testosterone Deficiency (TD)\nNon-specific symptoms are those that may or may not be linked to TD such as:\n· Lower energy level, endurance and physical strength\n· Poor memory\n· Difficulty with finding words to say\n· Poor focus\n· Not doing well at work\nHaving any one of the specific or non-specific symptoms may not mean that you have Testosterone deficiency. But if you have a mix of symptoms, for instance, if you start to feel very tired and sad over a period of time and this is a change for you, you may want to check for TD.There are many other possible reasons for these symptoms, such as: opioid use, some congenital conditions (medical conditions you are born with), loss of or harm to the testicles, diabetes, and obesity (being overweight).\nLow Testosterone and Sex Drive\nTestosterone isn't the only fuel for a man's sex drive and performance. But low testosterone can reduce your ability to have satisfying sex. Lack of sex drive and erectile dysfunction are sexual problems that can result from low testosterone. If low testosterone is the cause, treating it can help.\nTestosterone and the Causes of Low Libido\nResearchers haven't unraveled the mystery of just how testosterone increases libido. It's normal for men's sex drive to slowly decline from its peak in their teens and 20s, but libido varies widely between men. What one man might consider a low sex drive, another might not. Also, sex drive changes within each man over time and is affected by stress, sleep, and opportunities for sex. For these reasons, defining a \"normal\" sex drive is next to impossible. Usually, the men themselves identify a lack of sex drive as a problem. Other times, their partner may consider it to be an issue.\nLow testosterone symptoms don't always include feeling like you have no sex drive. Some men maintain sexual desire at relatively low testosterone levels. For other men, libido may lag even with normal testosterone levels. Low testosterone is one of the possible causes of low libido, however. If testosterone is lowered far enough, virtually all men will experience some decline in sex drive.\nIn a large study of men in Massachusetts, about 11% overall said they had a lack of sex drive. The researchers then tested all the men's testosterone levels. About 28% of men with low testosterone had low libido. These men were relatively young, with an average age of 47; older men might have worse sexual symptoms.\nIf you sign up you get access to all of them so you can study anywhere and at anytime.

      "description": "Updated January 14th, 2025\n\n★★★★★ After 2 weeks of trying the information you provided I started my weight loss again, let me explain. Back in May of this year I started on a weight loss program, your typical diet just eat below your calorie count. I started this weighing 220 lbs. and I dropped down to 185 lbs. just doing that with weight training. Then around August my weight loss was at a stand still and could not lose anymore weight for about a month. Then I came across your program and in 2 weeks of using the information you provided in this course I started to lose more weight, I am at 183 lbs. losing 2 lbs. and continue to lose weight. My problem spot is belly fat and now I am seeing the belly fat going down there as well.. With this program I am seeing results and will change the rating. I am glad I purchased your course and recommend it to anyone that wants to lose weight. I want to thank you for your help... H Sanchez, Tx\nEverything Your Doctor or Health Professional Has Told You About Exercising And Dieting to Lose Stubborn Belly Fat Is Flat Out WRONG.\n…And This False Information Completely Destroys All Of Your Hard Work and Sacrifice While Shutting Your #1 Fat Burning Hormone Down To A Grinding Halt.\nYou'll never have to:\nStarve yourself with the same old boring and bland diet such as chicken and broccoli or another tasteless frozen dinner you find in the supermarket.\nGet another expensive gym membership, outrageous gadgets or any other gym equipment to finally incinerate stubborn belly fat.\nSuffer through another long and boring cardio session that destroys your knees, back and joints.\nSpend more time doing wasteful exercises in a crowded gym\nWhy?\nBecause There's A NEW, Simple, Enjoyable, And MUCH Faster Way That Allows ANY Man or Woman in Their 30's, 40's, 50's and older to…Unlock Their Hidden Potential and Lose Stubborn Fat By Using Short But Effective 8 Minute Workouts That Increase Energy and Motivation  WHILE Losing Up To 14 Pounds in 21 Days WITHOUT Weights or Torture Diets!\nUnlike with starvation diets and traditional long exercise methods, my new fat loss solution course works WITH the unique biological changes your metabolism goes through between the  ages of 30-50's and beyond.\nThere's never been a metabolism treatment that was EASIER and FUN to fit into your busy lifestyle…\nYou may think you've tried everything when it comes to losing the stubborn midlife pounds…\nI'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter if:\nYou feel you are too out of shape and sluggish or overweight to attempt one of those insane DVD workout programs\nYour metabolism has come to a crawl because you unknowingly were doing the wrong workouts that left you frustrated.\nYou have a busy schedule with a stressful job and then come home to family life lacking energy.\nOR even if you've tried EVERYTHING and Failed in the past.\nYou’ll FINALLY see STUBBORN fat melt away from around your stomach, hips, and thighs while building LEAN muscle in the easiest and fastest way possible WITHOUT torture diets or suffering through long, boring and painful workouts.  You'll also:\nCreate an All-Natural SURGE of Fat Burning and Youth Hormones (release, \"burn off\", and permanently REMOVE your most stubborn fat)\nREIGNITE Your Dead Metabolism (can be done at any age, anytime, anywhere so it fits PERFECTLY into your busy lifestyle)\nReprogram Your Body to Burn MORE Fat Faster (EVERY time you use the Over-40 Fat Loss Solution Exercises.\nAll You Need To Do Is Follow The Fat Loss 40 Solution In This Course and You'll RESTORE and REJUVENATE Your Body Back To Its \"Youthful\" State Making Your Friends and Family Envious.\nIntroducing The Fat Loss 40 Solution\n\n\n\"The World's First and ONLY 8 Minute Fat Loss Solution for Men and Women in Their 30's,40's,50's and older Who Lack Time, Energy and Motivation!\"\nThese are all ten of my best Non-Cardio Fat Loss Protocols you won’t find anywhere else.\nSome people call it the Holy Grail of fat loss, because this is exactly how to lose fat without losing muscle.\nWhether you need to kick-start your fat loss today or you want to shred any excess fat when you’re done bulking up, you’re going to want to start adding my Fat Loss 40 Solution immediately.\nIn Fact, The Fat Loss 40 Solution BURNS Fat Up To 9 Times MORE Than An Hour Of Traditional Cardio Workouts.\nHere’s the deal when it comes to fat loss.\nYou likely have heard the best way to lose fat  is to add cardio and reduce calories. The problem is that this combo  always results in muscle loss and robs you from showing off your past 18 weeks of gains...\nThe \"common knowledge\" is that's just the way it is… you gotta do your cardio and you gotta drop calories.\nThat's the way I’ve done it for over ten years now myself. Turns out the common knowledge is actually nonsense.\nYes, cardio can burn fat, but the more you do, the more you put your new muscle and strength at risk... thankfully, there is something better… and much smarter… and much more fun.\nYou see, once you unlock the power of Body Weight Circuits (the other equally effective non-cardio fat loss method included inside Fat Loss 40 Solution), you will hold the key to quickly melting fat off your body like butter in a microwave, while leaving your hard-earned muscle intact…\nAmazingly, some guys I shared these tools with actually found they gained muscle while cutting.\nWhy?\nBecause these tools require you to actually keep your calories high and burn the fat off, instead of slashing calories and starving it off…\nAgain, the moment you start adding cardio or dropping calories, your muscle and strength are put at risk.\nNow you need to know these two tools are two of my best kept secrets amongnst myself and my 1-on-1 coaching students who are getting ripped  up while keeping their calories high and never stepping foot on a  treadmill…\nYou'll be able to get ALL the fat loss benefits in ONLY 7 minutes a day and NEVER have to suffer through another long and boring workout.\nHere's What The Fat Loss 40 Solution Will Do For You:\n\nTURN ON your body's #1 Fat Burning Switch and FLOOD Your Body FULL of \"youth\" hormones...\nHEAL the damage and FIX your broken metabolism\nTurn ON your \"Fountain of Youth Hormones\" to burn MORE fat and calories in 7-10 short minutes a day!\nBOOST your metabolic rate for up to 48 hours straight.\nTime your food consumption to work synergistically with your nutrition and burn belly fat FASTER than normal.\nEat your favorite carbs to INCREASE your insulin sensitivity so\nyou'll be able to eat LOTS of your favorite foods without storing fat\nDiscover the easiest way to indulge in your favorite carbs and sweet treats, while you NEVER store them as fat.\nTIGHTEN Sagging Skin And Tone UP Embarrassing Body Spots\nSKYROCKET Your Sex Drive\nDiminish Side Effects Of Getting Older In ONLY 8-10 Minutes A Day!\nWithin 6 weeks you can expect to...\nStrip off pounds of unsightly body fat\nSee your abs coming in for the first time in years…\nExperience a surge in your confidence and sex drive as your testosterone comes roaring back\nAnd you’re going to do all of this without without slaving away at ANY type of traditional cardio for hours at a time.\nThe ONLY thing worth investing in is YOURSELF!\nAll you’ve got to do is click the button to enroll and the Fat Loss 40 Solution Protocol will be added to your fitness arsenal and waiting for you inside the Private Students' Zone.\nSo grab your copy NOW and I will see you at the finish line!",

Shōu shì Ending Standing Posture\n\n\n\n\nTai Chi or Shadow Boxing, another school of Kungfu in Chinese martial art culture, was born in Henan Province, 70km north to David Yao's native place.\nTai chi, short for T'ai chi ch'üan or Tàijí quán  (Chinese: 太极拳，太極拳; pinyin: Tàijí quán), is a traditional Chinese martial art which combines mind and awareness of our body, the deep diaphragmatic breathing and Qi, the inherent vital energy, through graceful movements to achieve mindfulness and relaxation. Tai chi is practiced for both its defense training, its health benefits and meditation.\nQigong, qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功 qìgōng literally: \"Life Energy Cultivation\") is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used in belief it promotes health, spirituality, and martial arts training. Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind.  Qigong can be viewed as a medicinal movement practice, combining breath work, relaxation, movement and self-massage all in one.\nIn Chen Style Traditional 74 Form LJ1  (陈氏太极拳老架一路  Chén shì tàijí quán lǎo jià yīlù  Chen Style Tai Chi Traditional Form  One; Chen Style Tai Chi Old Form Set One)  is the foundation of all Chen Style Tai Chi which keeps the kicking, jumping and leaping movements which will apply in fighting.  Base on Chen Style Traditional 74 Form LJ1, I will show more advance skills - Chen Tai Chi Fighting Style which combines mind, awareness and traditional Martial Art Kong Fu Skills You May Never Seen! The features of Original Chen Style Old Form Two are the agile body movement, the punching skills, the elbow strike and even wrestling skills!\n\n\nWhat makes  Chen Style Tai Chi unique? It is 发力 fā lì, (releasing power; releasing power in explosive way),  It integrates whole body power and keep body in a relax states when release the power in very short and explosive way. The hitting point can be fist, elbow or knee. This Fali is different with boxing or kickboxing. You can take some movements to practice in fast speed and this can be very good sweating workout for you.\n\n\nThis will take you around 3 month to finish it. However, you can just take a single posture to practice.\n\n\nTai Chi Strengthens Mind and Body\nTai Chi’s focus on posture and body placement may add benefits beyond what cardiovascular or resistance-training can provide.\nTai Chi, a moving Yoga, does more than burn calories and tone muscles. It will enable you to gain flexibility and strength, reducing stress and allowing for greater relaxation. It's a total mind-body workout that combines strengthening and stretching poses with deep breathing and meditation or relaxation.\nThe health benefits of tai chi\nThis gentle form of exercise can help maintain strength, flexibility, and balance, and could be the perfect activity for the rest of your life.\nTai chi is often described as \"meditation in motion, moving Yoga,\"  which originated in China as a martial art.  The Chen Style Tai chi is the oldest and parent form of the five traditional family styles of Tai chi. Chen-style is characterized by Silk reeling, alternating fast/slow motion and bursts of power.  The Chen Style is Originated in Hen Nan Chen Jia Gou, 70 KM at north of David Yao's birth place.\nThere is growing evidence that this mind-body practice, has value in treating or preventing many health problems. And you can get started even if you aren't in top shape or the best of health.  In this low-impact, slow-motion exercise, you go without pausing through a series of motions.  As you move, you breathe deeply and naturally, focusing your attention — as in some kinds of meditation — on your bodily sensations. Tai chi differs from other types of exercise in several respects. The movements are usually circular and never forced, the muscles are relaxed rather than tensed, the joints are not fully extended or bent, and connective tissues are not stretched. Tai chi can be easily adapted for anyone, from the most fit to people confined to wheelchairs or recovering from surgery.",

      "description": "Most of us are pretty smart and successful people in life. We read, we work hard, and strive to make progress in our lives as we see fit. With all of that being true for whatever reason we simply can't stick to implementing a healthy exercise and nutrition plan for any extended length of time. There are just so many starts and stops that it is demoralizing. 65% of the population in America is over fat. More than half of that number is obese. We pay the price of being busy and ambitious with our waistlines. We settle for not enjoying the level of fitness & health that we desire. We have less energy, foggy thinking, lower vitality, and have become open to so many chronic physical ailments and diseases.\nMany of us lose motivation after a few days or weeks around fitness? You start out with the best intentions and then you get busy with life and before you even know it you have fallen off of the exercise bandwagon. You are back to eating whatever junk is convenient and the pounds are packed back on. The worst part of all is that once again we are a few pounds heavier and softer than before? Your energy is not as high as it should be? The mirror is not showing you the reflection that you want to see and you know that if you could just master consistency with your fitness efforts you you would be a lot closer to being that better version of you that you know deep down is inside. You'd be a better human, a better father or mother, better employee or CEO, you'd just feel better period know that you are realizing a higher potential. You are smart enough to know that a healthier body and mind favorably impacts all that you do.\n\"Built To Thrive Maintaining a Fit Body In Busy World\" is the right course for you If you want to discover why fitness is an area of struggle for yourself or for so many others around the globe. It teaches people how to unlock the inner ability laying dormant in us all to make fitness and other areas of struggle that yield great reward stick as a priority that gets done consistently.\nThis course outlines the practical and psychological steps that can be quickly learned and implemented (in a matter of 5 weeks or less.) toward mastering internal motivation that us humans need in order to eat & exercise the way that we know that we should. \"Built To Thrive\" bridges that gap between knowing what to do and actually getting it done. There is a focus on who we are becoming on the inside both in our hearts and in between our heads.\n\"Built To Thrive\" uniquely teaches students on a deeper level. This course uncovers the thinking, doing and being that makes some people able to exercise & eat healthily without fail. It also uncovers why others struggle and how to rewire the brain for fitness success. Simultaneous fitness/nutrition instruction are paired with personal development tools seamlessly in short videos. They are combined with action modules at the end of each module for you to physically implement what was taught. The smart approach of training the mind, adding knowledge, and working the body simultaneously is what makes this work.\nLet's face it we all intellectually know what to do when it comes to fitness. Staying the course and maintaining the motivation is the most common problem. Making fitness a priority is the underlining problem that makes us fail with fitness efforts. \"Built To Thrive\" was designed by Andre Farnell to de mystify how people take charge of their fitness and nutrition in ways that are sustainable and enjoyable.\nFitness is the tangible form of personal development & is marketed and perceived in a way that sets so many up for failure . We are programmed to believe that we are one diet away or one cool exercise program away from realizing our best bodies in the mirror and adding to the quality of our lives. It is time for us all to see past the charade. We believe that \"If we can just find the time\", or if \"I just get myself together and...\" or \"If I could just get this food thing under control\" \"If I had a personal trainer I would be fine\". In the meantime pounds are being packed on & energy is drained.\nThe course starts with a simple call to action to get things going.\n* We uncover the true source of fitness motivation.\n* We take a look at what is really stopping most humans from enjoying fitness success.\n* We teach how to discard the old stories about fitness and failure the spark new motivation.\n* Create a great plan of action that fits life and is very implementable and fluid.\n* We uncover how to keep it going, no matter what happens in life.\n\"Built To Thrive\" prepares you for embracing fitness & maintaining your best body when the demands of life hit you. You'll embrace fitness & nutrition in a way that the majority in the fitness industry won't teach you. With this course I may be putting myself out of a job. You will have the power to see success & results with just about any exercise or nutrition program that you decide to follow. Learn it, live it, & realize success.\nBy mastering the psychology, mindset & the physical mechanics of fitness and nutrition simultaneously you'll not only be able to get you or anyone into the best shape of life but the principals in this course transfer to all areas of life. Many of the principals that are outlined in this course I have used personally to evolve myself from an unwanted foster child bouncing from home to home & being abused while raising my younger brother, to becoming an internationally recognized and award winning fitness expert that has helped multiple thousands of people to transform their lives.\n\"Built To Thrive\" Maintaining a Fit Body In A Busy World creates better parents, employees, students, lovers, and people who once more fit and healthy enjoy peace of mind and an expanded quality of life. Learn to tap into being the very best version of you indefinitely this time. Leave a legacy worthy of you. Most fitness regimens don't address the kind of physical training, internal motivation, & mindset training that it takes to truly make fitness happen in the busy information overload climate. \"Built To Thrive\"Maintaining A Fit Body In A Busy World does.\nInformation has been pulled from working with the bodies and minds of thousands of clients, celebrities, executives, soldiers, athletes & every day people that have permanently changed their lives. Years of study around human ontology, behavioral science, exercise physiology, psychology,nutrition,& the personal experiences of an eighteen yr award winning fitness professional have also contributed to this course. Creating consistency & adherence to fitness goals is the core competency.\nBefore reaping the visible rewards in the mirror or lasting health and fitness results they must master consistency and intrinsic motivation around exercise & nutrition for the long haul. The mental foundation must be laid properly and linked to our purpose & \"what truly moves us\" before one can purposefully build the body, burn the fat, build the muscle, live healthier & abundantly enough to WIN!\n\"Fitness is not a lifestyle it is an integral part of living an amazing one.\"~Andre Farnell\nBuy this video course now and gain immediate access today!\nBONUSES\n4 Weeks of activities 2+ hrs of content 5 downloadable powerful worksheets.

This unique home-based workout program requires only a pair of dumbbells and no more than 45 minutes a week to complete.

But, this is the exact approach I use to get my clients real results while rewriting how they think about exercise. The key lies in the in the Synergy Set approach which combines the most effective, efficient, and safest forms of resistance training into a seamless flow. If you aren’t familiar with Isometric or High Intensity Training, prepare to have your eyes opened.\nThis program won’t have you doing anything the people typically think of as cardio. It won’t have you sitting around in between sets wondering if this is really the best use of your time. Instead, you’ll get in, hit it hard, and be done. This program won’t just give you exercises to do—it will completely change how you understand and approach exercise. And once this happens, you’ll look at those typical and think, ‘if only they knew’.\nIf you want to be healthy, strong, and physically attractive, but aren’t interested in refashioning your whole identity around exercise, this is the program for you.

I will cover all the important things that will take you to the next level of kettlebell training. You'll get access to over a decade of kettlebell experience in this course.\n\n\nThe kettlebell exercises covered in this course are the most injury-prone ones in kettlebell training and after you understand how to perform them correctly you can also start using them safely and without annoyances in your kettlebell workouts.\nNo more:\nRipped hands\nBloody hands\nBruising\nInjured biceps\nSore wrists\nPainful shoulders\nAnd a serious reduction in calluses.\n\n\nI will spend a considerable amount of time explaining the kettlebell clean and then I will also include lots of content on how to workout with the kettlebell clean. You'll be able to use the kettlebell clean to create strength, work your cardio, and to transition to other kettlebell exercises. The kettlebell clean is the number one exercise that everyone enthusiastic about kettlebells needs to learn, no matter what the goals of kettlebell training are. Being able to perform this exercise without ripping your hands, banging your wrists, injuring your biceps, and performing it efficiently is going to take your kettlebell training to the next level. Being able to clean effortlessly is going to shine through in your press, your jerk, and so much more.\n\n\nThis is also the one fundamental exercise if you want to get into kettlebell sport and do long cycle clean and jerk for which I will also include some videos.\n\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this is a high production video project, because it's not, not when it comes to money. But it is when it comes to effort and content. The video is shot during one of my 3-day mountain hikes with the kettlebell, there will be sounds of the water flowing wildly next to where I'm filming and there will be some wind in the microphone too.\nSo, if it's more important to have a high production video with crystal clear audio that is shot in a crisp looking studio, then this course is not it. But if you're after quality, passion, and original content that will help you understand one of the most important kettlebell exercises and some of its variations, then come and join me.\n\n\nHope to see you soon.\nTaco Fleur from Cavemantraining\n\n\nPlease note that our Udemy courses provide you with knowledge, and in some cases allow you to obtain a certificate of participation.

      "description": "Fascia connects…quite literally!\n\n\nYou can think of fascia like a spider web of interconnections encasing your whole body.\n\n\nFascia is sheets of connective tissue. Examples include: tendons, ligaments, joint capsules, cartilage, organs and muscular connective tissues.\n\n\nFascia forms beneath the skin; it attaches, encloses and separates muscles and other internal organs.\n\n\nFascia gives our body both shape and structure. It plays an important role in holding our skeleton and muscles together.\n\n\nFascia is integral to healthy, functional movement as it transfers and stores energy.\n\n\nFascia plays a role in transporting fluids and nutrients throughout the entire body.\n\n\nFinally, fascia is a sensory organ. In terms of area, fascia is the largest and richest sensory organ in the body. Fascia is constantly communicating information to the central nervous system and to the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls vital bodily functions, such as heart rate, respiratory rate and digestive processes.\n\n\nIn summary, fascia is essential to life!\n\n\nFascia can lose its elasticity or crimp-like formation over time. Lack of movement is one of the main reasons as to why this happens.\n\n\nFascia LOVES a variety of movements - kicking, swinging, rotating, jumping, squatting, bouncing, throwing, running, and more.\n\n\nOur modern-day lifestyle may not offer many opportunities for us to move like this. With that said, it’s important to move your body in order to keep the fascial system healthy, supple and nourished.\n\n\nSo, what happens when there’s disruptions in one or more areas of our fascial network? What happens when fascia becomes dense, sticky, congested and matted?\n\n\nWell, you may experience one or more of the following:\n\n\nchronic pain in one or more areas of the body\nreduced range of motion in one or more areas of the body\nstiffness, especially first thing in the morning\nlow energy\npoor mobility and flexibility\nmuscle soreness\nreduced collagen production\nincreased risk of injury\npoor coordination\nheadaches\npostural concerns\nbreathing restrictions\nadhesion\nand more!\n\n\nWhen fascia is healthy, it is wet and is able to glide and slide easily between the layers of the skin, fascia and muscles. As a result, we are able to move with more freedom!\n\n\nThis freedom in movement can have a positive impact on mood, energy level and emotional health.\n\n\nNow, if you’re sitting there thinking, it’s too late for me to make improvements to my fascial system…well, I’m here to tell you that it’s never too late!\n\n\nRecent imaging proves that fascia is alive. This tells us that the fascial system can be remodeled through movement that trains fascia.\n\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we will accomplish in this course!\n\n\nThis course may introduce you to new movements, or you may rediscover movements that you haven’t done in years.\n\n\nThis course includes 15 movement classes with 50+ exercises designed to stretch, strengthen, stimulate and revive your fascial system.\n\n\nWe work from the ground up in order to target different fascial lines that exist throughout the entire body.\n\n\nWe explore fascia routines for the lower body, core and upper body.\n\n\nIn addition, I've included a morning routine to help activate your fascial system, an evening routine that will help you unwind, destress and relax, and a chair fascia routine that you can do at home, at work and for when you're on the go.\n\n\nThis course invites you to explore, become curious about movement, play, reflect, make discoveries, and of course, have fun!\n\n\nThe beauty of these fascia exercises is that you can add them to your existing workout routine.\n\n\nAll you really need to do is 20 minutes of fascia exercises each week to start to notice and feel the changes taking place in your body.\n\n\nAre you ready to transform your body and find freedom in movement?! Well if you are, click the button that says “ADD TO CART” on the right-hand side.\n\n\nI am so excited for you!\n\n\nI look forward to moving with you soon!\n\n\nTake care,\n~Rachel\n\n\n*** Disclaimer - Before starting any exercise program, it is important to speak with a healthcare practitioner to ensure that the program is appropriate and safe for you.

      "description": "'The funnest piece of equipment' says Bruce a long standing Pilates client.\n\n\nHe along with the majority of my clients will pick the stability ball as the most enjoyable of all the equipment.\n\n\nThis is a homemade course and hopefully you find the workouts and information included insightful, beneficial and most importantly you feel the exercises working in a way that isn't strenuous.\n\n\nWhen you use the ball every movement you do, you are having to balance. This means that even just sitting on the ball would work numerous stabilizer muscles. The deep core muscles that protect your lower back are activated when you have to balance. This makes the ball workouts a brilliant option for relieving tight lower backs.\n\n\nBefore you begin your FUN Ball classes, start with learning all the correct Pilates principles and placements. By following these positions you optimize your workout tremendously. If you already know the basics, hop right along to the Ball section.\n\n\nThe Ball section starts with a tutorial on how to buy the correct ball size according to your height. We then discuss safety precautions before diving into the workouts.\n\n\nI've included an array of stability ball classes utilizing:\n\n\nThe Ball.\nA Wall, door or cupboard to lean on.\nLight weights (homemade weights using tinned food is absolutely perfect).\n\n\nThe classes will vary to keep your muscles guessing and keep the workouts new and fresh.\n\n\nIncluded in this course is also a full stretch class.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this program as much as I enjoyed creating it.",

      "description": "Looking For A TRX Workout Program That Is Based On Actual Science And Proven To Get You Results?\nThe course program is designed for people who are looking for an alternative to the traditional gym. TRX exercises are great for that. All you need are the TRX trainer straps, can choose your own workout location and train whenever you want.\nBut this program does more than teach you a few exercises and workout tips. In the course I go over the science behind building muscle and successful dieting, the perfect beginner workout plan and show you how to set clear and well-defined fitness goals that keep you motivated.\nBy giving you the necessary tools to reach your fitness goals, I will also have to debunk certain training myths that have been around for decades.

I've discontinued the site as it was very costly to maintain without actively using it for promotion. I started Honestemy (Honest Academy), which I dreamed would be a hub for real, reliable info, aiming to make a real difference. But, you know how it goes—my full-time job keeps me super busy these days, making it tough to keep that dream as alive as I wanted. :)\n***\nCourse Introduction:\nWelcome to \"From a Chubby Gamer to a Fitness Guru\"! Forget about getting an advanced fitness trainer certification from this course—instead, join me in a funny yet insightful journey through the fitness industry's darkest secrets and misleading myths.\nAs featured in imaginary Netflix specials (yes, that’s a joke—my humor might be lame, but my fitness advice isn’t), this course will debunk popular myths and expose the unspoken truths of fitness marketing. You'll learn not only how to shred your body by doing less but also how to cultivate a mindset that sees through the industry’s false promises (No, really, I'll teach you how to maintain your gains without turning into a \"chubby pig\").\nGoal:\nUncover the constructive and destructive cognitive biases affecting your fitness journey.\nReduce anxiety fueled by fitness industry standards and body dysmorphia.\nFree your mind from the clutches of social media misinformation and deceptive marketing.\nDive deep into the realities behind transformation journeys.\nProvide a science-backed, honest, and practical fitness plan to smash your goals.\nDemystify supplements, steroids, peptides, SARMs, and other industry secrets.\nCourse Structure:\nMindset: Brain hacks to steer clear of fitness industry propaganda.\nMotivation: Identifying healthy vs. dangerous motivators.\nExercise: Learn proven methodologies and train to become your own personal trainer.\nDiet: Exploring Glycemic Index, Mediterranean, Paleo, Keto diets, and Intermittent Fasting.\nSupplements & More: A deep dive into steroids, peptides, SARMs, and fat-burning agents.\nJoin me, a seasoned engineer-turned-fitness enthusiast, as I share not only my professional experience in the fitness, nutrition, and supplements industry but also my personal battles with body-shame and the anxiety of not matching up to those 'perfect' Instagram photos. I’m not just another salesperson—I’m here to guide you through a genuine transformation, armed with research and a lot of personal trials.\nWho should enroll? Anyone eager to build a better physique and develop a healthier mindset in their fitness journey. No prerequisites—just bring your curiosity and readiness to challenge the norm!\nEquipment Requirements: No gym? No problem! While a gym membership can accelerate your progress, it’s not essential.

      "description": "This course if for people who wants to get in shape and become fit without the need for Gym membership.\n\n\nYou can build a great, impressive body with just bodyweight exercises, and you won't need a gym membership either.\nWith your 1 monthly gym payment, you can buy a pull-up bar and a dip bar.\nApart from these, you only need your own body and will.\nThere are some things you need to know to build muscle. There is a lot of information pollution on these issues, which is very confusing.\nYou just need to know and practice the basics.\nNow I will explain them to you in the simplest way.\nBasically for muscle building, you have to train properly.\nyou should sleep quality sleep 8 hours and you should eat healthy.\nNow let's explain these issues in a simple way.\nTraining...\nFor muscle development, you should apply the exercises with the right technique.\nDon't worry about it.\nI have prepared a wonderful program for you. I have worked with thousands of students as a personal trainer. I am sharing all my experience in this matter with you.\nLet's talk about what you need to do now.\nTraining frequency\nIn general, training 3-5 times a week will be sufficient for improvement. The frequency and intensity of training varies from person to person. Everyone's lifestyle is different, their sleep patterns, what they do, their stress levels are different from each other, for example, a physical worker cannot be the same as an office worker.\nYou will adjust the training frequency and intensity according to your own life.\n\n\nIf you always train at the same intensity, you will not be able to improve.\nYou will apply the progressive over load technique for muscle development.\nProgressive overload simply means increasing training intensity step by step.\n\n\nHow will you adjust the training intensity?\n1- Increase the number of repetitions...\nYou can increase the number of repetitions. For example, you can only do 5 push-ups at the beginning. You have to increase it step by step. Once you can do 15 push-ups with proper form, you can move on to the next step.\n2- You can try the harder version of the exercise.\nAgain, to give an example over pull up. There are many types of push-ups. You can try hard versions of them.\n3- INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SETS.\nWith the right form, you can do 15 repetitions of 3 sets of push-ups. Start doing 4 sets.\n4- Use the time under tension technique:\nYou can do 15 push-ups in 15 seconds. Do 15 push-ups in 30 seconds. so you have to do it slower.\n5- add weight to yourself\nput some weight in your backpack and do the exercise that way...\n6- As the next step, start training with gymnastic rings.\nGymnastic rings require much more muscle activation as they are not stable. You can do more muscle work in less time.\nAs the next step, you can take a look at the gymnastics ring program I prepared for you.....\n\n\nNUTRITION, SLEEP, RECOVERY\nNutrition and sleep are very essential for the regeneration of our muscles.\nI recommend 8 hours of quality sleep for muscle development and recovery.\nNutrition is an important and very complex subject.\nBasically, if you want to lose kg, reduce your daily calorie requirement by 400-500 calories.\nIf you want to gain kg, add 400-500 calories to your daily calorie needs.",

But let's face it - we're smarter and more discerning now. We understand that true strength and power development isn't tied to just one piece of equipment or method.\nIn this age of functional training – where versatility and practicality reign supreme – the eternal debate lingers: Push Ups or Bench Press?

Play the video stations you’ll be doing for that session, so your students will be prepared and know what to do when they get going around the circuits in the hall:\nExercises: • ball twists • bicycles • crunches • side scissors • toe reaches • wind-wipers • crab kicks • hand walks • ski hops • star stretches • superman • 1-foot reaches • mountain climbs • plank • side plank • skipping • sprinting • wall sit • box jumps • frog jumps • hoop jumps • pistol squats • side lunges • surf switches • arm circles • bench dips • bunny hops • push ups • punches • wall push offs • airplane lunges • burpees • jumping jacks • knee ups • sumo kicks • squat & push\n2. Individual printable station cards\n› Simply print out (and laminate) the cards (A4 or A5), choose the circuit activities, and put them out around the sports hall. Minimal equipment is required, (at most a few balls, hoop & bench) so the setup of your lesson is so simple!\n3. Fitness testing sheets\nYou can print out the circuit scoring sheets for students to individually record their results/points at each activity. They can then track and compare their results term to term and see how they have improved.\nExtra posters\nAs extra content, I've put together 6 high-quality posters, 1 for each fitness component, showing the activities. These can be printed A4 or even A3 for you to put up around your classroom or gym area.\nI know you’ll love these circuit station task cards – If you are a teacher at elementary, middle or even high school, you need these task cards to help keep your students healthy and active, and they’re great anytime of the year.\nPrime Coaching is always striving to give you more than just the resource itself – You won’t find other fitness cards complete with supporting videos. I aim to provide you with professional sports-coach level resources that are so easy to teach and implement at your school as a teacher.",
