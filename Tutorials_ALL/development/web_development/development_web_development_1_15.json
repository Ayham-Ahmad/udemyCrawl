      "description": "jQuery Interview Questions and Answers Preparation Practice Test | Freshers to Experienced\nWelcome to our comprehensive jQuery Practice Test Course, meticulously designed to elevate your skills and prepare you for real-world applications and interviews. This course is not just a series of practice questions; it's a journey through the depth and breadth of jQuery, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in the world.

Let’s walk through what each section has in store for you.\nSection 1: Introduction to jQuery\nOverview and History: Delve into the origins of jQuery, understanding its evolution and its role in modern web development.\nSetting Up and Including jQuery: Learn the essentials of integrating jQuery into your projects.\nBasic Selectors: Master the art of DOM manipulation with jQuery selectors – a fundamental skill in web development.\njQuery Syntax: Familiarize yourself with the syntax that makes jQuery concise and learnable.\nDocument Ready Event: Understand the importance of this event in ensuring your code runs after the DOM is fully loaded.\njQuery vs JavaScript: Explore the differences and advantages of using jQuery over vanilla JavaScript.\nThis section is perfect for those beginning their journey in web development, offering essential knowledge and interview questions to test your grasp of the basics.\nSection 2: jQuery Selectors and Filters\nBasic CSS Selectors: Identify elements with ease using jQuery’s powerful CSS selectors.\nHierarchical Selectors: Learn to select elements based on their hierarchy in the DOM.\nBasic Filters: Enhance your selection criteria with jQuery's filter methods.\nContent Filters: Dive deep into filtering elements based on their content.\nVisibility Filters: Manipulate and interact with elements based on their visibility.\nAttribute Filters: Explore how to select elements based on their attributes.\nIn this section, practice test questions will challenge your understanding and application of selectors and filters, crucial for efficient DOM manipulation.\nSection 3: jQuery DOM Manipulation\nGetting and Setting Content: Understand how to manipulate the content of elements.\nAdding and Removing Elements: Learn the dynamics of dynamically modifying the DOM.\nManipulating Attributes: Get hands-on experience with changing and setting attributes of elements.\nCSS Class Manipulation: Master the art of adding, removing, and toggling CSS classes.\nWorking with CSS Properties: Dynamically change the style of elements.\nTraversing the DOM: Navigate through the DOM tree with jQuery’s traversal methods.\nThis section’s questions focus on DOM manipulation, a key skill assessed in many web development interviews.\nSection 4: jQuery Events\nEvent Handling Basics: Grasp the foundation of handling events in jQuery.\nMouse Events: Understand how to interact with mouse actions.\nKeyboard Events: Delve into handling keyboard inputs.\nForm Events: Master the handling of form submissions and related events.\nDocument and Window Events: Learn to manage events triggered by the document or window.\nEvent Delegation: Explore jQuery's efficient method of handling events for multiple elements.\nOur practice tests in this section are designed to prepare you for interview questions around event handling, a critical aspect of interactive web pages.\nSection 5: jQuery Effects and Animations\nShow and Hide Effects: Learn to control element visibility.\nFading Effects: Create smooth transitions with fading effects.\nSliding Effects: Implement sliding animations for dynamic user interfaces.\nCustom Animations: Discover how to create complex animations.\nStop, Delay, and Callback Functions: Manage the timing and sequence of your animations.\nChaining Effects and Animations: Learn the art of linking multiple effects elegantly.\nThese questions will challenge your creativity and understanding of animating web elements, a frequent topic in web developer interviews.\nSection 6: AJAX and Asynchronous Operations with jQuery\nIntroduction to AJAX with jQuery: Get to grips with AJAX, a cornerstone of modern web applications.\nLoading Data with $.get and $.post: Learn these fundamental methods for server communication.\nJSON and AJAX: Understand how to handle JSON data in your AJAX calls.\nHandling Errors in AJAX Requests: Develop robust error handling strategies for your AJAX requests.\nPromises and Deferred Objects: Master these advanced techniques for managing asynchronous operations.\nAJAX Events and Callbacks: Handle asynchronous events with finesse.\nPrepare for interview questions on AJAX, a must-know for any aspiring web developer, with our targeted practice tests.\nWe Update Questions Regularly\nStaying current is key in the ever-evolving field of web development. That's why we regularly update our practice test questions to reflect the latest trends, techniques, and best practices in jQuery. This commitment to freshness ensures that you're always preparing with the most relevant and up-to-date material, keeping you ahead in your learning journey and interviews.\nSample Practice Test Questions\nQuestion 1: What is the primary purpose of the .delegate() method in jQuery?\nTo attach a handler to an event for the selected elements.\nTo trigger a specific event.\nTo attach a handler to an event for elements that match the current selector, now or in the future.\nTo remove an event handler.\nExplanation: Option 3 is correct. The .delegate() method is used for attaching event handlers to elements that match the selector, now or in future. This method is particularly useful for handling events on dynamically added elements. While Option 1 describes event handling, it doesn't capture the essence of .delegate() which is its ability to work with future elements.\nQuestion 2: Which method is used to perform a deep copy of an object in jQuery?\n$.extend()\n$.copy()\n$.clone()\n$.deepCopy()\nExplanation: Option 1 is correct. The $.extend() method can be used to perform a deep copy when its first argument is true. This creates a new instance of the object, including copying properties from the source object to a new target object. $.clone() is used for cloning DOM elements, not for objects, making it incorrect in this context.\nQuestion 3: In jQuery, what does the method .siblings() do?\nSelects all sibling elements of the selected element.\nSelects the immediate next sibling element.\nSelects the parent element.\nSelects all child elements.\nExplanation: Option 1 is correct. The .siblings() method in jQuery is used to select all sibling elements of the selected element. It's a way to traverse sideways in the DOM tree. The other options refer to different jQuery traversal methods.\nQuestion 4: How does jQuery's .fadeOut() method work?\nIt hides an element by increasing its opacity.\nIt shows an element by decreasing its opacity.\nIt hides an element by decreasing its opacity.\nIt changes the visibility of an element without affecting its display.\nExplanation: Option 3 is the correct answer. The .fadeOut() method in jQuery is used to animate the opacity of the matched elements to zero, after which the elements are set to display: none. This gives the effect of a smooth disappearance, or \"fade out.\"\nQuestion 5: What is the difference between .eq() and .get() methods in jQuery?\n.eq() selects a DOM element while .get() retrieves the DOM elements as an array.\n.eq() retrieves elements based on a condition, while .get() selects elements based on their index.\n.eq() retrieves a jQuery object, while .get() retrieves a DOM element.\nThere is no difference; they are synonymous.\nExplanation: Option 3 is correct. The .eq() method in jQuery returns a jQuery object that wraps the element at the specified index, allowing for continued jQuery method chaining. On the other hand, .get() retrieves the native DOM element at the specified index, which means you can't directly chain jQuery methods on it.\nEnroll now and start your journey towards mastering jQuery and acing those interviews!",

Postman allows you very quickly to create a request with the required HTTP method and parameters, submit the request and easily inspect the results.\nI have created this course for testing engineers as well as for software developers or other technical positions.  Postman can help you during the development of your API, as well as after the API is completed, by running tests that make sure your API is still working as intended.\nIn the first part of the course, we will start exploring the features of Postman and continue by writing API tests with the intention of integrating them into a CI server where the tests will run on a current basis.\nBut this is not the normal course you take part in. Because your needs may be different and because I hate leaving you wondering what to do next, the second part of the course will include user questions and answers to problems that were not yet covered in the course or that are more specific and may not interest everybody.\nSo let’s look at what you are going to learn:\n\n\nHTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)\nJSON format\nStart with simple requests and advance toward more complex scenarios\nLearn to deal with authentication/authorization mechanisms like Basic Auth, API Keys, or OAuth.\nStart writing API tests\nOrganize tests in collections and share them with your team\nRun API tests in Jenkins or any other CI server\nYou ask, I answer\nSo after this course, you will know how to use Postman as a pro.\nExcited to learn Postman?

The course not only cultivates students' programming thinking but also helps them understand art production, allowing students to easily take control of Web3D project development. Different from most Web3D courses on the market, this course doesn't just teach you how to use Three.js. It also enables you to learn the production of art resources such as 3D models. Taking the construction of real Web3D commercial projects as the main thread running through the course, it starts from two aspects: art resource production and the application of Three.js. It will guide you to grow efficiently into the Web3D talent that companies need. Instead of simply stacking knowledge, the course follows the actual project development process, leading students step by step to restore and complete the entire process of commercial project development. It helps students become independent Web3D developers, while equipping them with the ability to create 3D art resources and the flexibility to apply Three.js, so that they can independently create their own works.",

To a large extent, the quality of the work that you do will determine how far your content gets shared.\nand you will learn a magic course step by step and make a huge revenue per month.\nCreating high-quality viral content may not be for everyone. It’s a difficult task, especially when you’re just starting out. For example, if you’re creating visual content or video content, you need to invest in good equipment and sharpen your video editing skills as wel\nPractically useful content: After collecting information about the content on the Times home page (i.e., author’s fame, content release timing, writing complexity, author’s gender and length) to determine what factors were most often found in great content that went viral, the researchers concluded that content that is useful in a practical way has a high chance of going viral. This may mean adapting your digital marketing campaign in a way that puts valuable content first.\nWhen it comes to visual content and images that get shared the most, a research experiment by BufferApp found that viral images trigger surprise. This indicates that one of the key things that make images go viral is an element of surprise\nhis explains how a music video, released by Psy, a previously little-known Korean singer, rocked the world. Within a month, the Gangnam Style video also rocked YouTube’s homepage, as the #1 most viewed video. This is a great example of a piece of visual content that became idolized.\nWithin days, the video also reached #1 on the iTunes music video chart. It now has over 2,300,000,000 views.\nDon’t forget that people also shared these videos on their social network or via click to tweet because the experience of watching made them feel good – or at least better. This is known as social currency – people share and talk about things that make them feel cool or improve their self-worth, this is one of the driving forces behind using a social network.\nWith countless websites on the Internet, standing out and becoming a viral site like Buzzfeed may seem impossible, unless you have the right strategies in place.\nThis course will teach you exactly how to successfully build a viral media blog and get your articles to go viral by attracting thousands of visitors daily.\nOnce you harness the power of your viral blog, you’ll be able to generate extra income online.\nBuild Your Very Own Viral Website and Generate Consistent Traffic\nThroughout this insightful course, you’ll access the tools and techniques necessary to create a professional looking website in a short amount of time. You’ll then populate it with content that’s sure to go viral.\nThe key to generating the highest amount of traffic possible, though, lies in getting your site out there. Therefore, this program will also share insider traffic information that will help you better understand what it takes to get people to your site.\nFinally, you’ll cover effective monetization strategies that you can implement easily in order to effectively transform your site into one that’s popular and generates profits.\nCourse Content\nYou’ll begin this course with an introduction that includes the differences between a viral blog and a traditional blog so you can understand the importance of creating viral content.\nThen you’ll walk through every step in building your very own website, including getting your domain name and hosting, as well as designing a blog on WordPress.\nNext, you’ll cover all aspects of finding the right viral content for your blog, and you’ll dive into the type of content that truly drives traffic. You’ll even master the fastest and easiest ways to generate a variety of posts, including those with images and videos.\nOnce you have your content, it’s time to promote it so you can get the viral traffic your site needs. You’ll be shown a step-by-step process that you can replicate to dramatically increase the number of hits that your site receives daily. Plus, you’ll tackle social media and social news site strategies that really work.\nFinally, you’ll cover a few ways to monetize your viral blog to increase your profits. You’ll focus on a two-part strategy using indirect and direct advertising, and you’ll even learn how to install content delivery on your site.\nAfter completing this course, you’ll be totally confident in your ability to create a viral website that will get people talking while generating profits for you.",

      "description": "This course covers in-depth the Typescript language and includes several practical projects. It comes with a running Github repo.\nThis Course in a Nutshell\nOne of the biggest novelties in the Javascript frontend development space in the last few years is that the use of Typescript has become almost universal.\nTo the point that it almost does not make sense anymore to start a new project and not use Typescript, given its huge advantages, and almost no downsides.\nAnd this includes projects not only in Node, but also in React, Angular, and any other Javascript-based frontend framework.\nTypescript is a strongly typed language that is a superset of Javascript, meaning that Javascript programs are valid Typescript programs (depending on the settings we use for the compiler), but not the other way around.\nSo in a nutshell, this means that you can see Typescript as a better and improved version of Javascript.\nBut even though superficially similar, Typescript due to its powerful type system is actually a completely different language than Javascript.\nThe static type system of Typescript provides many advantages as it allows us to catch many program errors at development instead of at runtime, and it enables powerful development tooling such as precise auto-completion and different types of refactoring.\nBut to benefit from the power of the type system, we actually don't have to add type annotations everywhere and end up with code that looks like Java or C#, and sacrifice flexibility, development speed and readability.\nThe type system can automatically infer the types of most variables automatically, without us having to declare them explicitly, meaning that we can essentially write type-safe Javascript-like code with minimal type annotations.\nThis powerful type inference is really the killer language feature that makes Typescript the preferred way of starting both a frontend and a backend project today: we get all the benefits of a static type system essentially for free, with no downsides.\nCourse Overview\nThis course is divided into multiple sections, that you can take directly depending on your previous level of familiarity with the language. So there are multiple learning paths available for you, depending on your previous experience.\nThe course will start with a deep dive into all the language features starting with the most basic ones but covering also in detail the most advanced features.\nSo if you are already familiar with some of the features you can skip ahead, and focus only on the features that you aren't aware of yet.\nWe will present the language features from the most elementary ones to the most advanced, and we will cover first the features that are most commonly used.\nFor completeness, we will also cover a lot of features that are rarely used, but we will point that out explicitly, especially if it's a feature that you are very unlikely to ever use while coding at the application level.\nBesides the language features, we are going to dedicate a full section to the configuration of the Typescript compiler, and go over every option you have available.\nWe will make it clear when a compiler feature is rarely needed when compared with features that you will be using all the time.\nWe will still cover everything for completeness, but we want to give you the option to focus only on the most commonly used compiler options if that is what you prefer.\nAfter this initial section covering all language features, we are going to cover also in detail Object-oriented programming, Generics and Decorators, each in their own section.\nThese 3 sections are mostly independent of the rest of the course and can be taken separately.\nAfter the language sections, we enter the part of the course that covers practical projects.\nThese practical projects are as close to what you would develop in the real world as possible. This means that these are still small projects that you can comfortably build without spending too much time, but they contain all the building blocks and illustrate all the same design elements that you would have to put in place in a real application.\nFor example, we are going to build a complete example of a REST API in Node using Typescript and TypeORM, a Typescript-friendly ORM for Node. The server will be designed will all the typical elements of a production system in mind.\nFor example, the API will be fully secure, and it will require the user to be properly authenticated with a JWT. The API will support multiple levels of access, from a read-only user to an admin user that can edit the data.\nNext, once the backend is completed, we are going to build also a couple of frontends with Typescript, namely an Angular frontend, each one in its own separate project.\nThis way, you will have built your complete system (both frontend and backend) using only one single common language: Typescript.\nTable of Contents\nThis course will go over the following topics:\nIntroduction to Typescript\nThe Typescript Type System\nThe most powerful feature of Typescript: type inference\nIn-depth coverage of all the Typescript language features, from the most simple to the most advanced\nIn-depth coverage of all the features available in the Typescript compiler\nObject-oriented programming\nTypescript Generics in depth\nTypescript Decorators in depth\nPractical Typescript Project  - Secure Node REST API with TypeORM\n\n\nWhat Will You Learn In this Course?\nIn this course, you will learn everything that you need to know to build both the backend and the frontend of your application using the same language: Typescript.\nYou will know all the features of the language in-depth, and you will be aware of the distinction between the features that you will be using almost every day, from the features that you will only sparingly use.\nYou will also know in detail the multiple features that you have available in the Typescript compiler.\nYou will know how to build real-world projects with Typescript, including how to develop your backend with Node and Typescript, and also how to build your frontend in Typescript using modern frameworks.\nHave a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!",

      "description": "Everybody knows ElasticSearch as a popular full-text search engine or as part of ELK but I am going to show you ElasticSearch from the side you have never known before. I want to show you that with ElasticSearch you can build very advanced search engines or even recommendation modules that can be much more effective and together with that, much more simpler than similar systems built on top of machine learning technologies. I want to show the real geo power of ElasticSearch for building advanced search filters and aggregations.\nThis course is built in such a way it would be useful both: for complete beginners and for people who are working with ElasticSearch but would like to extend their practice knowledge. It would be especially useful for those who are going to build some recommendation systems or advanced search mechanisms in the near future.\nThe course consists of 5 modules. First module is aimed for beginners and can be skipped by people who are already working with ElasticSearch. Here I will tell you about basics: how to install and configure the environment using Docker, how data at ElasticSearch are organized, why mapping is so important and what all that mess around tokenizers and analyzers means.\nIn the second section I will show how to build an advanced search system step by step on a real example of a simplified booking com version. We will touch the topics about ES geopower here.\nNext course section is devoted to the recommendation module. Here we will speak about recommendation systems in general - about pros and cons of today's methods. And again together we will build a real system using ElasticSearch. We will create a recommendation mechanism for virtual example of cleaning houses' marketplace.\nIn the fourth section I will show real examples using php, python and Java libraries for integration with ElasticSearch. And again we will create real microservice applying best programming practices and interesting design patterns like builder pattern or filter pattern. I will touch here also the question of debugging the possible problems.\nThe fifth and the last part is about using ElasticSearch for production. Here I will share with you my knowledge on how to set up a highly available cluster, how to calculate shard size and storage requirements, how to index millions of documents in the most efficient way and even how to preserve zero downtime at reindexing",

This is where you, the student with skill and knowledge in custom web application development comes in. You will be contracted to develop and deploy this applications. Integrating attractive and dynamic dashboards to your application will increase your product and service value.\nIn this course, you are going to learn how to build dynamic dashboards with attractive charts, tables, data labels and progress bar for your web application using FREE Javascript, CSS codes, PHP,  MySQL, HTML & Dreamweaver without a writing a single line of PHP, HTML or Javascript code of your own.\nAfter deploying your first application with this dashboard, that’s it. You will not need to build another dashboard from ground up for another project. All you need to do is duplicate your first application, create a new database link and re-customize the duplicated version to meet the scope of your new project. Remove all features that are not needed in the new project, edit or add a few features that are needed in the new project and you are good to go.\nMy early days of learning how to develop web applications with dashboards charts and graphs where full of struggles. Where I could not succeed, I leaned on commercial plug-ins to achieve my objective. But after several months of studying and researching, I am able to deploy web applications with attractive dashboard without spending extra funds on commercial dashboard plug-ins. You, on the other hand, are going to learn all this in a couple of hours. what a privilege.\nDon't hesitate.

Employers will have access to create jobs and perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations related to the jobs. Employees, on the other hand, will be able to access all the jobs in the portal and can apply for jobs based on their qualifications.\nTo prevent duplicate applications, the application will restrict users from submitting multiple applications for the same job.\nThe application will also provide application status tracking, allowing users to track the status of their job applications. Employers will receive an email notification whenever a new application has been placed for one of their jobs, while employees will receive an email notification whenever the status of their application is updated.\nEmployers will be able to view the profiles of the employees who have applied for their jobs, while employees will be able to view the profile of the companies that have posted the jobs.\n\n\nNext.js 13 is the latest version of the popular React framework. It was released on March 8, 2023, and includes a number of new features and improvements.\nHere are some of the highlights of Next.js 13:\nNew Image component: The new Image component makes it easier to display images without layout shift and optimize files on-demand for increased performance.\nNew Font system: The new Font system automatically optimizes your fonts, including custom fonts. It also removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance.\nNew App Router: The new App Router provides a more flexible and powerful way to manage routing in your Next.js application.\nImproved performance: Next.js 13 includes a number of performance improvements, including faster image loading and improved hydration.\nIf you're using Next.js, I recommend upgrading to version 13. It's a major release with a number of great new features and improvements.\nHere are some additional details about the new features in Next.js 13:\nNew Image component: The new Image component is a major improvement over the previous Image component. It supports native lazy loading, which means that images are only loaded when they are visible on the screen. This can significantly improve performance, especially on mobile devices. The new Image component also supports automatic image optimization, which can further improve performance.\nNew Font System: The new Font system is a significant improvement over the previous font system. It automatically optimizes your fonts, including custom fonts. It also removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance. The new Font system also supports automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means that you can host your fonts on your own server, which can further improve performance.\nNew App Router: The new one is a major improvement over the previous one. It provides a more flexible and powerful way to manage routing in your Next.js application. The new App Router supports nested routes, dynamic routes, and more.\nImproved performance: Next.js 13 includes a number of performance improvements, including faster image loading and improved hydration. Hydration is the process of converting a server-rendered page into a client-rendered page. Next.js 13 has improved hydration performance, which can lead to a smoother user experience.\nIf you're using Next.js, I recommend upgrading to version 13. It's a major release with a number of great new features and improvements.",

      "description": "Have you often felt that when you create complex and robust applications the focus usually drifts from the functionality to the infrastructure?\nThis is where Spring MVC and Spring Boot come to the rescue. They are lightweight frameworks that will help you develop flexible and robust stand-alone applications without much hassle.\nThis Learning Path is designed to introduce you to advantages of having frameworks, such as Spring MVC and Spring Boot, while developing apps.\nA Video Learning Path from Packt essentially contains multiple video courses that are logically tied together to provide you with a larger learning curve.\nLet’s dig into what this Learning Path does. It gets you started with creating, deploying, and running a Spring MVC project using Spring Tool Suite and then moves onto building a Spring Boot application. It will also show you how to integrate model and business services based on an example of an online e-commerce chocolate store!\nOnce you have gained hands-on experience with Spring MVC, the course will introduce Spring Boot. Then move on to learn Spring Boot by scaffolding an application and understanding different aspects of it. In addition to that, you will also learn to secure applications against malicious behavior.\nAfter completing the course, you will be able to successfully create stand-alone, Spring-based applications using Java that work on multiple platforms!\nAbout the Authors:\nFor this Learning Path, Packt has brought the works of two authors who are working very closely with Java, Spring, and Spring Boot.\nKoushik Kothagal has over 12 years of professional experience working with various server-side technologies and developing web applications. He has worked extensively with Java, Spring, Oracle, and other enterprise technologies. He loves teaching, and when he’s not coding Java, he’s probably teaching it! In his spare time, he runs the tutorial website Java Brains which covers various enterprise Java technologies.\nGreg L. Turnquist has developed software professionally since 1997. From 2002 to 2010, he was part of the senior software team that worked on Harris' $3.5 billion FAA telco program, architecting mission-critical enterprise apps while managing a software team. He provided after-hours support to a nation-wide telco system and is no stranger to midnight failures and software triages. In 2010, he joined the SpringSource division of VMware, which was spun off into Pivotal in 2013.",

All the sections and lectures are split in a way that will help you get the most of this course which no boring sections.\nYou will not just learn AngularJS but you will understand it. Learn from whom works with it on a daily bases and have the passion to coach ( that would be me lol ).\nAll the code is written on each lecture and explained as we write it.\nEvery section has one \"introduction\" and one \"overview and download\" lectures which helps to prepare you for what is coming and to wrap it up with what we just learned.\nThere are 10 projects to be developed with you on the fly and if you feel like skipping it no worries you can always download it.\nFor the last project we will create a nice Blog application using Bootstrap, toastr which can be seen on the last free preview.\n\nAngular 4 is there but many companies cannot move even to Angular 2 because of compatibility. This will teach you from the basic $scope to the complex stuff like routing, services, multiple controllers, using date filter, promises and much more.\nI hope you join me on this adventure.\nFeel free to watch the introduction video and the previous available.\nCheers\nMarcos Costa",

This course is about learning Web Development and obtaining a full understanding of all three languages. I take a more direct approach, teaching you nearly all of the syntax and helping you understand why they exist by delving into some of the history about Web Development, and then I reinforce this with quizzes after every 5 videos along with several Code-Along Projects.\nEach video is so simplified that there is no need to constantly check for the code in the downloads page. Each Part is a full list of Syntax from W3C, the makers of HTML5 and CSS3, so that almost No Syntax is missed. We go over each one and I give you the simplified explanation of what the syntax does and how to use it or why it is used.\nAs my Students from Learn The Quickest Way for Writing a Book that I use can tell you, I take students seriously. I respond within a day and, if it's a problem I think other students may have, I create an entire video just for that one problem.\nThis course will be included inside of each bigger language that I cover, Ruby, C#, Python, and Nodejs. If you have taken multiple Web Development courses and some of the information just doesn't seem to stick, then this is likely the perfect course for you.

We’ll start with the fundamentals and progress step by step, making the learning process smooth and approachable.\nBefore getting started, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS—things like how to structure a webpage and apply basic styling. A little familiarity with JavaScript is helpful but not required. If you’ve read through any part of the Bootstrap documentation or played around with it briefly, that will also be an advantage, though not necessary.\nI’ll walk through every line of code we write together, explaining how and why each part works. You’ll learn how to use Bootstrap’s powerful grid system, components, and utility classes to create a responsive, professional-looking website. We’ll also incorporate simple JavaScript to add interactivity, making your site more dynamic and engaging.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a polished, functional portfolio website that you can customize and expand on your own—and the confidence to keep building from there.",

This course targets all levels and will help to get started quickly with your journey in web development using ASP.NET Core and Angular.\nCurrently Angular is the most well-known and used client-side processing frameworks. Angular was a huge advancement for web development as it introduced web components where you can create a reusable set of HTML elements. Also, you get to have types which are something that was quite a pleasure to have to aid you in your development process. TypeScript is the static language that provides you with great support for your client-side development. Angular since 2.0 is using TypeScript. Angular is growing every day and the provide support for the versions that they release for a certain amount of time so you can guarantee that you will get updates as needed.\nASP.NET Core is the evolution of ASP.NET. And it’s the most advanced version of ASP.NET so far. It introduces a huge set of features. From the out of the box DI to the kestrel server which currently has amazing benchmark results if you look around.

Typically, TDD will divide each task of the development into individual units. A test is then written to ensure that the unit behaves as expected.\nTest driven development is a concept usually used in standard projects that many software developers surprisingly don't know.\nEvery project that uses Test-Driven Development follows three simple steps repeatedly:\nWrite a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.\nWrite the functional code until the test passes.\nRefactor both new and old code to make it well structured.\nContinue cycling through these three steps, one test at a time, building up the functionality of the system. Testing will help you to refactor, which allows you to improve your design over time and makes some design problems more obvious.\nThe tests that contain small individual components are called unit tests. While unit tests can be carried out independently, if you test some of the components when they are integrated with other components, you are doing integration testing. The third kind of testing is test stubs. Test stubs allow you to test your code without having to make real calls to a database.\nJoin me in this course as I expose you to whole new world of programming.",

      "description": "How to create charts in Chart Js with MySQL Database Data?\nThis is truly a topic that I really love. Perhaps you are just like me that in the very beginning you do not know how to do this. I`ve been there and eventually I decided to truly learn this wonderful skill. It took a really long time because this topic is not commonly discussed and secondly the skills are what you can call multi disciplinair. This means that you are not only dependent on one single programming language.\nYou need to know a bunch of them all together and combine it in a way that is really challenging. However, one thing I still remember and this is what truly makes know thing this wonderful. It was the feeling of being able to do this, and making charts and dashboards in a way I always dreamed of.\nThis course is a challenge, however, I describe it all in detail. It is in bite sizes and very easily done. If you follow you will get results and be able to do it yourself. However, do not neglect what you learn here. It took me truly months to understand all of these items and put them together as I did.\nThis course is deeper then you would expect.\nSince the topic is far more expensive then you could imagine you will notice that I will discuss it from every angle I possible can imagine. Ever heard of a planned and unplanned database? Well, so many options are possible and this creates a real challenge.\nYour database might not be build for Charts but you are not able to change it and must work with what you`ve got. I get it and this is also what I learned to do. You might have a different structure and want to combine it all together in a database. Well, I understand this as well.\nWhen I created this course I focused on the database connection but in reality that is just the tip of the iceberg. The connection is one part, having the right database structure is the second, and making it dynamic is a completely different level. I`m talking about AJAX and JS functions (if you are experienced) you will know what I'm referring to.  And of course knowing how to connect everything with the updating function of Chart JS. Well be ready!\nItems in this course will be sometimes repetitive. I really did this on purpose because this is how I learned this well. If you create 10 different charts with all kind of connection structure you will be really good. Because the experience you gain from doing this is really worth it. After that you basically could dream it. Although the challenge of this is really different every single time.\nChartJS is really fascinating and somehow I truly love to see how those charts come to life and start to tell a story with numbers. I sincerely hope you enjoy this course as well. One of the things that always give me a spark of joy is seeing a chart in action the moment it is connected. It might sound weird but seeing your chart change by a click of a button or connected with a database is very similar to seeing seed becoming a plant. It is fascinating how it can grow. Not because of the growth but once you know this, you see yourself growing and all the new possibilities you can do with a chart.\nI hope I can transfer some passion charts into you and I sincerely hope it gives your the inspiration to truly take this course. Not for me,... but for yourself. See how your new gained intelligence will make your skills bloom even further then you can imagine. I ask you to try it to explore how far you can blossom!",

      "description": "Welcome to Next.js Ultimate - Build a Music Player App! (This course using Next.js version 15 right from the beginning.)\nNote: This course is NOT focus on the CSS\n\n\nUsually, when you watch a tutorial, you think you \"get it\". But after you start working on the project, you find it difficult—you don’t know where to start. Why? Because most tutorials show you the \"correct code\" right from the beginning, but they don’t teach you how to find that code, how to practice, or how to test and refine your way to the \"correct code\". That’s what we call \"tutorial hell\"—you only know how to follow instructions, not how to solve problems independently.\nIn this course, we break that cycle. You’ll learn how to think like a developer, tackle challenges head-on, and build your project with confidence.\nThis course is your ultimate guide to mastering Next.js, the most powerful React framework for building modern, high-performance web applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this hands-on course will take you step-by-step through the process of building a feature-rich Music Player App from scratch. By the end of this course, you will have a fully functional music player app.\nWhat Will You Build?\nAdmin Dashboard with React and Ant Design\nIn the first project, you’ll use React and Ant Design (antd) to create a fully functional and visually appealing Admin Dashboard.\nMusic Player App with Next.js\nAfter mastering the admin dashboard, we’ll dive into Next.js to build a dynamic, fully interactive Music Player App with MUI.\nThis course is packed with practical projects and code-along exercises designed to give you the skills and confidence to build complex web applications.\nJoin now and take the first step towards becoming a Next.js pro.",

      "description": "RESTful Web APIs allow developers to create unprecedented applications by leveraging the data on the Internet. Since JavaScript is the language of the web, building APIs using Node.js provides a seamless development experience on both the front end and the back end.\nThis video course gives you an overview of a RESTful API and goes through the logical steps of building one. It explores three different APIs, focusing on their similarities and differences to effectively implement one.\nWe’ll start off by defining APIs, showing how they can be built on top of HTTP, and listing the properties that make an API RESTful. We will develop Twitter Notes, a web application that lets its users leave notes for their Twitter friends. We will use Twitter’s API to implement a login flow and then design a web API. In addition to using Twitter’s API, we will take a closer look at two other real-world APIs—Facebook API and GitHub API. Finally, we’ll end up honing some best practices to keep the APIs secure, maintainable, and performant.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a good grasp of APIs, HTTP, REST, OAuth 1.0a, API testing, and API security. Since the course explores three different REST APIs, you will reach a level where you will be comfortable using any RESTful API, even if it does not have an SDK.\nAbout The Author\n\nSaleh Hamadeh started programming when he was 13, and he currently studies computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Saleh became president of gt-webdev, a student organization focused on teaching students web development. During his time at Georgia Tech, Saleh interned as a web developer at BrainJocks and Yahoo! Saleh is passionate about the future of the web and hopes to work, learn, and teach in that field.",

After finishing this course, you will be able to develop your applications on your own.\n\n\nFor the databases, you will learn how to setup SQL server in Windows server environment and with that - two ways of interacting with databases from your C# code. One of them (ADO.NET) will be more rudimentary and the other way (Entity Framework Core) will be more modern and in some cases more simple in the short run.\n\n\nOn the backend, you will learn how to build .NET 5 APIs (C# APIs). It will be done in a very straightforward way and it will not take too much time to learn.\n\n\nFor the front-end, you will learn how to use the most modern way of developing web applications - Blazor. This technology allows you to run C# code directly on the Browser and with that, you will C# instead of JavaScript for your front-end logic. Alongside the Blazor technology itself, you will learn how to interact with APIs in a very modern and convenient way. You will also learn how to establish a WebSocket connection between your client and server.",

With this course, you are going to add value to your existing JAVA and SpringBoot knowledge by getting familiar with Hilla web framework. Adopting Hilla will help you create a full-stack (frontend/backend) applications in one project structure using a well know technologies like Java, Typescript, SpringBoot, and Node.js.\n\n\nThe course covers several topics often useful in corporate JAVA development but not exclusively. SpringBoot is being used here as an underlying framework used by Hilla web framework by default. Hilla integrates a Spring Boot Java back end with a reactive TypeScript front end. It helps you build apps faster with type-safe server communication, including UI components, and integrated tooling.\n\n\nThe primary idea of this course is to help existing SpringBoot/Java developers to adopt Hilla web framework and move from common backend development to frontend also. Hilla makes this connection much more feasible and you hopefully get a taste of this in our course. Are you working with Angular or React with SpringBoot backend? This course can help you to get a taste of more tight integration Hilla makes to SpringBoot backend and reuse your existing SpringBoot skills on a full scale.\n\n\nTopics covered by this course:\nDuring a course, we create a basic Hilla single-page application and each lecture will add a new enhancement to it. Eventually, we create a single application with many different features.\nunderstanding Hilla project structure\ncreating a single-page Hilla application step-by-step\nusing MongoDB as persistent data storage\ncollaboration using server Push technology\nexport application data in MS Excel format\n\n\nAn important part of this course is to realize 'what we don't need to do' when using Hilla. Simplification can be huge and the old saying that 'the best code is the code you don't have to write' is proven here.\n\n\nGitHub repository:\nThe source code is available through the link attached to the last lecture in this course. You can clone the repo and use the code snippets we are building in this course.\n\n\nWho is this course for:\n‘Starting with Hilla’ course is targeted at individuals or small/medium teams of professional Java developers that want to be productive and competitive in this large market. You will see how Hilla and Vaadin take away the unnatural \"need\" to split teams into Frontend and Backend developers, with all the communication hassles that come with that all the time.",

      "description": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\nDeclarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\nComponent-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\nLearn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.\nRedux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It works best in extensive, sprawling applications. However, to utilize it properly, first you need to prepare. Everything should go smoothly as long as your middleware is all done and you have full control over fetches, states, etc. In Redux, you don’t have to fetch everything all the time. This is the reason why Redux remains the most popular flux-based tool for state management.\nFrom the architecture point of view, Redux helps maintain order in the folders and files of the project. It helps programmers understand the application’s structure and introduce new people to the project (providing that they have previous knowledge of Redux). Its components are: global JS object, reduction functions, actions and subscriptions.\nThe widespread use of Redux gets even funnier when you consider the fact that the creators themselves (Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark) used to say that you might not actually need Redux. It’s important to understand what you can do with it before you stick it in your programming tool belt. Especially since there’s another solution that works great not as a competition, but rather as a supplement: React’s API interface!\n\n\nThe origins of SPA, a single-page application, go back to 2013 and the creation of the React library, used by Facebook. One of its biggest advantages was performance, achieved with VDOM.\n\n\nState management is the repository for the current state of the app and its data. It’s a common part of all the views. For example, in the case of user data; the avatar, the full name, etc. are stored in Redux.\nFront-end state management is a kind of logic that stores and refreshes current data, such as the information about the options button being highlighted, about the authorization of the user, etc. Or, if we were to put it in a more abstract way, it makes sure that business transactions are complete – by storing input data of the user interface and synchronizing it across the pages, back-end, and front-end parts.\nIt’s also helpful in drawing a line between the business and view layers. This makes the app run faster without having to load the same elements all over again – they’re simply stored in Redux.",

This course also includes PHP8.1, which is up to 50% faster than previous versions of PHP.\nHaving issues with your current shared web host? With this course you can...\nSay goodbye to shared hosting and one click WordPress installers!\nSay goodbye to bad web hosts!\nSay goodbye to terrible tech support that take days to solve issues\nSay hello to the only WordPress course that is going to put YOU in true control of your server and your WordPress sites.\nSay goodbye to bloated control panels filled with ads\nAs your site grows some shared hosts will throttle your site and sometimes even shut your site down if your site consumes to many resources. The more visitors you get, the more resources you are going to use. It ends badly, with your site income reduced to zero and your clients angry due to the downtime...\nShared hosting is designed for hosting static sites, not dynamic WordPress sites. Some of the main disadvantages of shared hosting:\nyou are sharing server resources with many other websites -  this causes slow loading times and poor performance if other sites on the server are using too many resources.\nif another site on the server is hacked, it could potentially affect your site as well.\nyou are limited by the amount of customization you can do with your site.\nWhat's the solution?\nThe solution is to move your WordPress hosting to a Virtual Private Server. If you need more control over your website's performance, security, and customization, you need to consider a VPS hosting.\nSome of the main advantages of VPS hosting:\nWith VPS hosting, you have dedicated resources that are not shared with other users, which ensures that your website is not affected by the activities of other websites on the server and due to this you experience better performance.\nVPS hosting allows you to customize your server environment to meet your specific needs - Redis and Memcached are just two examples\nVPS hosting is scalable, you can easily increase or decrease the resources allocated to your server depending on your needs.\nVPS hosting is more secure compared to shared hosting because your resources are isolated from other users on the server. This reduces the risk of your website being affected by security vulnerabilities in other websites on the server.\nWhat this course offers?\nWhen you take this course, you will soon realize and wonder why it took you so long to move your WordPress sites from shared hosting to an unmanaged VPS. Please don't let the word unmanaged scare you. An unmanaged VPS simply means the host keeps the network connected and the host node running, you are in control and responsible for everything else on the server. I'll guide you, step by step through the process of setting up an unmanaged VPS and then I'll also be guiding you through setting up WordPress on that VPS.\nNever used the command line before? Never edited a configuration file before? No problem, I will teach you and provide you with the knowledge you need.\nI cover all aspects, no matter if you are using Windows or MACOSX. We will download the software, I'll show you how to install and configure the software and most important how to use the software. Prior to each section, I'll explain what we are doing, why we are doing it and in plain easy to understand English. You won't find any long and boring PowerPoint presentations and minute after minute looking at me talking to the camera. It's us and the command line, nothing else. The command line is easy to use, just think of terminal as a very basic word processor. I'll be there guiding you step by step.\nThis course is based on using Apache as your web server for the following reasons:\nmore compatible with different web applications and plugins, including those used by WordPress.\n.htaccess files makes it easier to make changes to a WordPress site without needing to have access to the server configuration.\nhas a more user-friendly configuration process, this is a huge advantage for those who are not experienced server administrators.\nlarge ecosystem easier to find support when you need it.\nOne of the most important and often overlooked aspects of this course is that you will be able to use the knowledge gained from this course to add to your monthly income.\nYou can do this by:\noffer and charge for various services on freelancing sites\noffer existing clients additional services for a recurring monthly fee\noffer new clients services for a recurring monthly fee, you can now offer hosting instead of just design services.\nSign up for this course and start that journey to becoming the server administrator of your own servers and sites...",

We will see the meaning of a utility-first framework which Tailwind is compared to a component based approach, such as Bootstrap. Then we will move on to the installation using node and organising tailwind.config.js , i personally chose to use PostCSS , which is a postprocessor ,in this course for the installation so we are looking for postcss.config.js; the main reason of this choice is to add autoprefixer to our modules with which we can take care of the vendors names and get read of future problems , also i could have shown you how to optiomise css for production using postcCSS and cssnano but i decided to skip this part so keep the course fast and understandable to every level of reader. for those who is interested into these topic go check them out . Installed Tailwind I'll show some basic feature and classes of Tailwind to then make use of them to create a Tesla Landing Page to make a practical example of what Tailwind can really do .

      "description": "Master React Hooks by Example: Learn all the Hooks in React 17, 18 and 19!\nAre you ready to take your React skills to the next level? If you’re familiar with React’s basics and want to dive deeper into its core functionality, \"Master React Hooks by Example\" is the perfect course for you!\nIn this developer-friendly course, we’ll demystify all of React's built in hooks by exploring them through practical, real-world examples. These hooks are the foundation of modern React development, empowering you to build dynamic, efficient, and maintainable applications.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nuseState: Manage state effectively within functional components.\nuseEffect: Handle side effects like fetching data, updating the DOM, and more.\nuseRef: Work with mutable references and interact directly with DOM elements.\nuseContext: Share data across your app without prop drilling.\nuseReducer: Manages complex state logic by taking a reducer function and an initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function to update it\nuseMemo: memoizes expensive calculations, returning a cached result only when its dependencies change\nuseCallback: memoizes a function, returning the same instance unless its dependencies change, to optimize performance in child components\nuseImperativeHandle: customizes the instance value exposed when a parent component accesses a child component's ref.\nuseLayoutEffect: runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before the browser paints, ensuring layout updates are applied immediately\nREACT 18 Hooks\nuseId: generates a unique ID for components, for consistent identifiers for accessibility and form elements\nuseTransition: marks state updates as non-blocking transitions, improving UI responsiveness during expensive state changes\nuseDeferredValue: defers updating a value until less urgent updates are finished, improving performance by preventing UI lag during expensive renders\nuseSyncExternalStore: ensures a consistent state snapshot from external stores, supporting concurrent rendering and server-side rendering\nuseInsertionEffect: is used for injecting styles or performing DOM mutations before React makes changes to the DOM, ensuring minimal flickering or inconsistencies.\nREACT 19 Hooks (New!)\nuseActionState: manages the state of server-side actions, such as form submissions or data-fetching, within React Server Components.\nuseFormStatus: provides the current status of a form, including submission state and error handling, typically used in React Server Components\n**CUSTOM HOOKS**\nLearn how to build custom hooks in React including:\nAPI Axios: how to use a custom hook to communicate with API using the popular Axios library\nOptimistic Updates: how to make a website appear to be perform FASTER with Optimistic Updating\nDebouncing: How to debounce website inputs\nAnd Much More!\nHow You’ll Learn\nThis course emphasizes learning by doing. Through hands-on examples, you’ll explore typical scenarios you’re likely to encounter in real development projects, such as:\n\n\nManaging form inputs with state.\nFetching and displaying data from APIs.\nPersisting references across renders.\nCreating and consuming a context for global state management.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll not only understand these hooks conceptually but also feel confident using them to solve real-world challenges in your React applications.\n\n\nWho Is This Course For?\nThis course is ideal for beginners who:\nHave a basic understanding of React.\nWant to learn how to work with hooks in functional components.\nPrefer practical, example-driven learning.\nWhether you’re looking to solidify your React knowledge or prepare for more advanced topics, \"Master React Hooks by Example\" will equip you with the skills to build powerful, modern React applications.\nEnroll now and start mastering React 17, 18 and 19 hooks today!",

It is Object based (doesn’t support inheritance) and is case sensitive language. It is very loosely typed. i.e it doesn’t have any datatypes. It’s a specification by initially Netscape and is acknowledge by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association). Javascript language together with HTML DOM (Document Object Model) API is used to make the web page dynamic or interactive. Also we can do client side validations of data before the form is submitted to server.\njQuery is a fast, lightweight multi-browser JavaScript library. The Best part of jQuery is that Interacts with the DOM, makes ajax requests and also creates effects even after javascript is been disabled in the browser. jQuery also allows functionality for developers to build plug-ins.\nThis Course is compiled by Mr. Sandeep Soni, Microsoft Certified Trainer with experience over 21 years.\nMr.Sandeep has worked closely with many IT companies and helped them with their technology resources training needs.

      "description": "Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does . This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language .\nIn simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font.\nWith just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. It’s is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.\nNowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose programming language—meaning it runs across the entire software stack. The most popular application of it is on the client side (aka frontend), but since Node.js came on the scene, many people run JavaScript on the server side (aka backend) as well.\nWhen used on the client side, JavaScript code is read, interpreted, and executed in the user’s web browser. When used on the server side, it is run on a remote computer. You can learn more about the difference between frontend and backend programming in our guide .\nJavaScript isn’t only used to create websites. It can also be used to build browser-based games and, with the help of certain frameworks, mobile apps for different operating systems . The creation of new libraries and frameworks is also making it possible to build backend programs with the language, such as web apps and server apps .\nIf you’re interested in learning more, we’ve covered more examples of what is JavaScript used for, including code in more depth elsewhere . But now that we know some of the array of uses of this twenty five year-old language, why learn JavaScript in 2023?\nThe world of web development is constantly moving. With so many new tools popping up all the time, it can be extremely difficult to know where you should focus your efforts. As an aspiring developer, you’ll want to make sure that what you’re learning is still relevant in today’s industry .\nIf you’re having doubts about this language, don’t . It’s important to note that since its creation in 1995 JavaScript is pretty much everywhere on the web—and that’s not likely to change any time soon . According to the 2023 StackOverflow developer survey, it’s the most commonly used programming language for the ten year in a row .\nIt is currently used by 94.5% of all websites and, despite originally being designed as a client-side language, JavaScript has now made its way to the server-side of websites (thanks to Node . js), mobile devices (thanks to React Native and Ionic) and desktop (courtesy of Electron) . Package managers like npm make it even more powerful .\nIf you want to kick things off now and get a taste, in this video our resident web developer Abhishek gives you an introduction to JavaScript .",

      "description": "There's an absolute bevy of courses on the internet on how to build websites using all kinds of platforms and frameworks. Although these courses are generally very helpful in teaching more about certain topics like HTML and CSS, I have yet to come across a course that shows you how to create a custom template from scratch.\nAfter doing multiple online courses on the internet to teach myself web development, I realised that teaching others my workflow could not only save them lots of time, but give them a solid understanding of a tool that has become one of the most powerful in my arsenal.\nThe objective of this course is to run you through a step by step process on how to create a custom template using a component called Template Creator CK. This component can be installed into Joomla and Wordpress, and operates inside the CMS to make the creation of templates from scratch an absolute breeze.\nThe course is structured in a top down approach, where students will take an existing design and start creating the template from the navigation area, all the way down to the footer area. Thereafter we will look at concepts like responsive design, template overrides and adding custom CSS to the template to add some aesthetically pleasing effects with CSS transitions and transforms.\nStudents wishing to enroll should already be familiar with HTML, CSS and either Joomla or Wordpress. Although Joomla is the preferred CMS for this course, Template Creator CK will soon be available for Wordpress, so if you have a solid understanding of the skillsets covered here, you can extend the utility of this course to create templates for Wordpress as well.\nThe total runtime of the course is roughly 2.5 hours, but I would recommend doing each section slowly and practicing the concepts taught to get the most out of the material. Students will need to purchase the Template Creator CK component, but I can assure you it will be money well spent.\nTaking this course will teach you a fantastic new way of creating beautiful, versatile and responsive templates for the two biggest CMS's out there today.",

Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.\nWhy is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?\nHTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.\nWhat is an HTML element and why is it important?\nHTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “<p>” for a “paragraph” and “<title>” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “<html>” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “<title>This is the Title to the page.</title>” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “<p>” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.\nIs HTML a programming language?\nHTML is not considered a programming language but rather a markup or formatting language. This is an important distinction. Formatting languages merely control how things are displayed on a visual level, whereas programming languages are more dynamic; they use logic gates to determine the behavior of a program. But there is some crossover. “DHTML,” for instance, refers to Dynamic HTML. It is a type of HTML augmented by Javascript to make it easier to adjust on the fly. Because HTML, Javascript, and CSS are so frequently used together, they can often be folded together, which can contribute to some confusion regarding whether HTML is a programming language.\nIs HTML hard to learn?\nHTML is known as one of the easiest languages to learn. It’s also one of the most ubiquitous. Many individuals interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development will learn HTML first. While HTML is largely intended for websites as a language, it is also used in many other programs. For example, when you create an email signature, you will usually be using HTML. Emails themselves use a combination of HTML and CSS. An advantage (and an occasional double-edged sword) to HTML is that it is very forgiving. You can get some HTML wrong, and your page will still be displayed, if not exactly how you want it to be.\nWhat jobs use HTML?\nNearly any development or design job will require a cursory understanding of HTML. HTML has also evolved dramatically since it was originally developed; it is far more complex and standardized than before. Because of this, even those who have been experts in HTML during their career may need to undergo an HTML refresher periodically. Most jobs that require HTML will involve web design, web development, or layout and design. For example, someone who manages a content management system such as WordPress may not need to know any other programming languages but should still know HTML basics. Similarly, someone who formats online newsletters or an online magazine in an administrative capacity may not need to be a web designer or web developer but might need to understand the principles of HTML.\nWhat is responsive design?\nResponsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\nWhat is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?\nCSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.\nWhat careers use CSS?\nCSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.\nWhat skills should I have before learning CSS?\nBefore learning CSS, you should know the basics of using a computer and how to use a text editor because that is where you will be writing CSS. You should also be familiar with web browsers for browsing the web because it will inform your use of CSS. Since you may end up using specialized tools to write CSS, you should know how to install software on your computer and create and manage files and folders on your computer so you can create a CSS project. Once you have those skills down, the next thing to learn is HTML; after all, CSS is nothing without an HTML page to apply styles. That should be the basics you need to know to get started with CSS.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.\nA great introduction to Bootstrap.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the \"JavaScript with Real World App Javascript Projects\" course.\nJavaScript (JS) from scratch, JavaScript libraries such as React, Angular, Node with hands-on projects with JavaScript!\nThis course is for beginners. Before taking this course, you only need to have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. In our course, the basics of JavaScript are dealt with in detail, and students are provided to test what they have learned with code quizzes prepared for each subject. React, javascript, javascript projects, angular project, angular, react projects, angular projects, react Project, javascript Project, app Project, real World Project, javascript libraries, javascript app\nJavaScript is the number one programming language for internet applications.\nHere's how a JavaScript code works, not just how it works. Because in today's JavaScript world, besides writing a code, you need to know how to debug this topic and be able to read every written JavaScript code.\nJavaScript is a text-based computer programming language used to make dynamic web pages. A must-learn for aspiring web developers or programmers, JavaScript can be used for features like image carousels, displaying countdowns and timers, and playing media on a webpage. With JavaScript online classes, you can learn to build interactive web applications, choose the best framework, and work with other programming languages like HTML and CSS.\nDuring our course, you will be informed about the basics of JavaScript in detail and how to solve problems.\nThe most important feature that distinguishes this course from the others is that it deals with the most basic issues about JavaScript in detail and helps students to put what they have learned in theory into practice.\nIn our course, you can test what you have learned on both MAC and Windows computers. You do not need to purchase any tools or applications as free tools and platforms are used.\nDuring the course, I made sure to explain all the topics that may seem complicated to you as simple and detailed as possible. I have used some diagrams to help you understand better.\nJoin more than 12 million learners and train up on JavaScript on Udemy. Choose from a wide range of top-rated JavaScript courses. From back-end development to app or website building, we’ve got you covered. Our real-world experts can lead you through hands-on projects to apply your skills.\nWhat is JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.\nWhy is JavaScript important?\nJavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.\nWhat are the main uses of JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.\nReact vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?\nChoosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.\nWhat is JSON and what is it used for?\nBecause of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.\nWhat is AJAX and what is it used for?\nAJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.\nHow can I teach myself Javascript?\nOne of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.\nWhat is the best IDE for Javascript?\nWith all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add functionality.\nWhen you complete the course;\nHow you can operate on variables,\nBoolean logic,\nHow to create a conditional statement,\nHow you can perform transactions with Loops,\nHow a function is created and why it needs arguments,\nHow Arrays and Objects, which are basic data structures, are created,\nHow DOM Manipulation is done,\nYou will have learned and had the opportunity to test what you have learned with the code quizzes in our course.\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now to our JavaScript with Real World App Javascript Projects course\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "Before Flexbox arrived on the screen, we had to use relative or absolute positioning, floats, clears and 100s of lines of code to achieve a decent website layout.\nAll of that's changed now.\nWith CSS Flexbox, you can layout your website's design in just a few lines of code, and even make it responsive!\nNo more frameworks like Bootstrap to make up for the shortcomings in CSS. Become a professional web designer in just a few hours.\nIf you know the very basics of HTML and CSS, you're all set.\n\nSpend a few hours learning a bunch of Flexbox syntaxes, and you'll be creating awesome web layouts in no time at all!\n\nYou don't need to learn a bunch of frameworks to become a pro web designer now!\n\n\nWhat will you learn in our course?\n\n\n1.

How to order elements on the page without changing their order in your HTML code.\n7. How to automatically change the width and heights of the elements so they fill up the space of their parent containers, without giving fixed dimensions.\n\n\nWhat are some real world applications of what you learn in this course?\nBy applying the concepts you learn in this course, you can code and design:\n\n1. A simple, one dimensional, 2 or 3 column website that are perfect for small businesses.\n2. More complicated websites with more columns. With the concepts you learn, your imagination is your only limit. You can make the layout as simple or complicated as you want it to be.\n3. Create websites for smart phones and tablets. Responsive web designing.\n4. Turn an existing website responsive by adding flexbox properties to the layout.\n5. Create portfolio websites of every kind that can be showcased in your projects and job applications.\n6. Get freelance projects on the fly because you now have a VERY valuable skillset added to your resume.\nSky is the limit! You can apply what you learn here anywhere in the web space, in any sphere.\nYour imagination is your only obstacle to how you apply what you learn here in your real world projects.\n\n\nHow is this course designed?\n\n\nOur course has 4 modules, where each module will thoroughly explain the intricacies of one of the concepts in Flexbox with a wealth of over-the-shoulder examples.\n\nWe'll be using a real world example to explain the concepts.\nHere are the modules:\n\nModule 1 - Flex container and display - This is the foundations module. We’ll look at how to make an element a flex container so that its child items can be manipulated. We'll also look at what Flex items are and their significance. In this module, we'll be creating and designing a menu bar, one that looks like the ones used in websites of the real world. We'll be using this menu bar to explain the Flex properties and how they affect website elements.\n\nModule 2 - Basic flex properties - In this module, we’ll look at how to manipulate the flex items of a flex container, that is, how to shrink it, grow it, wrap it if it gets too big for the screen, set a basic width or height for it, etc.\n\nModule 3 - Enhancement properties - We’ll look at further enhancement properties for the flex items, like aligning them in multiple ways, manipulating individual items, changing orders, etc\nModule 4 - Create a website - real world project - In this module, you'll learn how to create a simple, 2-column website, one that looks like most of the small business HTML websites out there. You'll also learn how to make it completely responsive.\n\n\nWe also cover a lot of examples and projects, like:\n\n\n1. Mini project at the start of the website where we create a real world navigation/menu bar and make it completely responsive.\n2. A real world 2-column website with a responsive header, navigation bar, 2 columns (main content and sidebar) and footer. We'll also make the entire website responsive.\n\n\nWhy should you choose our course?\n1. We like to be thorough in our teaching. You'll find everything you need to start creating awesome web designs and layouts with Flexbox code/syntaxes in this course. You won't have to look anywhere else.\n2.

If you follow along with our examples in our over-the-shoulder trainings, and create the mini project and apply the properties along with us, you'll be confident in embarking into the world of Flexbox and web design (responsive and otherwise) by the time you finish our course. You'll be able to confidently add this as a skill in your resume.\n4. We prefer creating fun projects to explain the concepts and to keep things interesting as well. You'll learn how to apply the concepts you learn in the course in the real world projects and examples.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Enroll now and start creating awesome web layouts and designs with CSS Flexbox syntaxes in no time at all!",

      "description": "Caution: Each Student will need to purchase The Plugin which is not belongs to this Course. I have used paid Plugin on this Course.\nI HELP ALL STUDENTS VIA TeamViewer USING Skype CALL TO FIX ALL INITIAL ISSUES.\nCreative way to turn any version of NodeJs Express Application Into Single-Page Application Within 2 minutes after using my (toufiqElahySPA.js)Jquery Plugin. Here, toufiqElahySPA.js is a Jquery Plugin which is responsible to turn any web application into single page application. I developed this Plugin to minimize developer's effort while working on Creating Single Page Application. Let's see, how my Plugin can make developers life better.\nSingle page applications are more capable of decreasing load time of pages and the amount of data transfer from server to client.\nWhy This Course?\nThere are several pain points while working with Javascript framework like AngularJs, React, VueJs, Knockout, meteor e.t.c. in a NodeJs Express application in order to create Single-Page Application. Few Pain Points Are:\nNeed to specify routing for each request\nNeed to modify Server side technology according to Javascript framework\nOnly possible to debug on run time\nHard-coded data-binding caused too many error\nIncrease the complexity a lot\ndeveloper no need to learn any javascript framework and also no need to write much Jquery code to make Single Page Application after using my Jquery Plugin(toufiqElahySPA.js).\nNote: developer can also use other JavaScript framework(angularjs, knockout, react e.t.c.) side by side with my Jquery Plugin. But no need, i will prove.\nI applied the Plugin in a Nodejs Express Web application. This plugin will also work for Other Web Technologies too. I will show in my future course.\nThis course is so important to Developer who loves:\nStrongly Typed data-binding\nCompile time error checking,\nauto code completion(IntelliSense),\nRe-usability ,\nnot to get Run-time error unexpectedly\nto get rid from complexity should definitely take this course.\nWhy (toufiqElahySPA.js)Jquery plugin is better than any JavaScript framework:\n(1) Developer won't need to write too much Javascript code after using my plugin wheres developer usually writes too many javascript code while working with AngularJs(javascript framework)\n(2) Developer won't need to write Jquery ajax code because the plugin has ajax function specified which will be called automatically as a common function\n(3) Developer won't need to specify routing as like AngularJs because My plugin will follow nodejs express routing by default.\n(4) Developer can learn using my plugin easily and quickly. just need to follow only 5 rules of my plugin and any complex scenario can be achieved through this plugin like AngularJs [i will prove]\n(5) Developer can also make Single-Page app even not following those 5 rules of the plugin. Those rules are for critical situation. First 2 rules is enough to solve any heavy lifting work.\nWhat technology is used in front-end?\nMainly Jquery\nHTML Code\nWhat technology is used in back-end?\nNodejs\nMongodb\nJavascript\nWhat tools you will need?\nAny text editor\nNodejs will need to be installed in your Machine\nAny browser Whatever you like most\nWhy I applied My Plugin to NodeJs Express application:\nCross-platform needs.\nHigh-performance and scalable systems.\nWithin this course I will Show:  How powerful and complex cross-platform single page application we can build with my Plugin  And how my SPA technique can improve the Software performance both on server and client side.\nHow toufiqElahySPA.js(jquery plugin) works:\nIf End user click any Link or submit any Form or click Backward or Forward button on browser, the common ajax function of the Plugin will be invoked automatically.\n5 rules of the plugin to handle critical situation:\nI will explain all these 5 rules within this course. True fact is: learning these 5 rules are enough to learn this entire Course. Learn By Doing.\nIf something is still unclear, you can ask question in the forums, i will reply. Make sure you followed my video's and source code and specially my 5 rules. Happy Coding!\nI hope! You will Enjoy this magic Course.\nImportant Notice:\ni want to ensure all the Student that my Plugin(toufiqElahySPA.js) will not be responsible for any server related error while applying the Plugin(toufiqElahySPA.js)  in your own Project. you may just need to modify toufiqElahySPA.css according to your application need. If you get a server related exception that means your implementation has problem which need to be fixed. Don't ever think that the Plugin maybe the reason for this exception.\nplease, give good ratings and comments if you want to get this type of creative and unique course in future. Good feedback will definitely encourage me to make more course on Udemy. Thank you!\nNotice(to all):\nIf i don't get good ratings and comments, i will not able to get inspired to share more content. if u really want to get Advanced Topics . please give me true ratings and comments.",

The admin will have access to the entire application, while the seller will have access to their own products and bids. Every product must be reviewed and approved by the admin to sell on the platform.\n\n\nWe will also cover how to handle multiple image uploads using Cloudinary, Multer, and Node JS. Buyers can see the available products in the portal, filter the products, place bids, and use the bids/quotes functionality for the products.\n\n\nThroughout the course, we will provide 24/7 QA support and code access to help you along the way. We will also cover how to implement trigger notifications functionality for all the actions in the application.\n\n\nThis course is suitable for developers who have some experience working with the MERN stack and want to learn how to build a refurbished goods-selling platform with complex MongoDB queries and different user interfaces for sellers, buyers, and admins. By the end of this course, you will have the skills and knowledge needed to create a fully functional refurbished goods-selling platform with real-time notifications and access controls.\n\n\nWhat is MERN Stack?\nMERN Stack is a collection of powerful technologies and robust, used to develop scalable master web applications comprising backend, front-end, and database components. It is JavaScript that is used for the faster and easier development of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack is a technology that is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework for building applications and dynamic websites.\nMERN Stack consists of four main components or can say four main technologies:\nM stands for MongoDB ( Database ), mainly used for preparing document databases and is a NoSQL (Non-Structured Query Language ) Database System\nE stands for Express, mainly used for developing Node.js web framework\nR stands for React, mainly used for developing a client-side JavaScript framework\nN stands for js, mainly used for developing the premier JavaScript web server\nEach of these four technologies plays an important role in providing an end-to-end framework for the developers. Even these four technologies play an important role in the development process of web applications.\nBefore MERN stack, it was earlier named as MEAN stack, MERN Stack is one of the variations of MEAN, here MEAN is also comprises of four components or say four different technologies, i.e., M is for MongoDB, ' E ' is for Express, ' A ' is for Angular.js, and ' N ' is for Node, here if you will observe, then you can identify that in MEAN, ' A ', i.e., Angular.js is replaced by ' R ', i.e., React.js in MERN, the main reason behind is - MERN Stack is mainly used for faster development of smaller applications as compared with MEAN, MEAN stack is a mainly better option for large-scale applications. Still, it takes more time for the development of smaller applications. They also both have different structures comparatively.",

Bootstrap is an open source set of styling rules and components built by Twitter to make building web pages quick and easy. With AngularJS and Bootstrap joining forces, we get tools to quickly and easily create interactive and dynamic websites that look and behave similar to popular websites.\nThis video course will take you through a journey of building your first web application with AngularJS and Bootstrap. Each video will build on the functionality already learned in the previous video, always leaving you with a new feature of the running application.\nStarting with no knowledge of AngularJS or Bootstrap, you will build up your knowledge through practical examples covered throughout the course. You will cover topics including external libraries to improve the ease of use, dynamic data bindings, dynamic styling, multi-view pages, form feedback, and AJAX form submission.\nBy the end of the video course, you will be able to successfully build a fully functioning web application.\nAbout the Author\nSimeon Cheeseman is a JavaScript developer primarily focussed on AngularJS and NodeJS. He started off his career coding Coldfusion HTML pages before teaching himself AngularJS and later NodeJS as they started getting traction. He has been employed building a variety of web-based applications from content management systems, phone bill re-rating programs, customer resource management, and billings systems. He is currently heavily involved in several open source AngularJS projects and when he has the time, he helps out on StackOverflow and Wizperts.",

      "description": "\"Build a SaaS: Develop a Subscription-Based App from Scratch\" is a hands-on, 10-hour course designed to take you from a foundational understanding of web development to building a fully operational SaaS application. Utilizing Django and Python, this course introduces modern web app development techniques while focusing on creating a functional subscription-based Todo app that can support real users.\nWe begin by exploring the basics of web development, covering the concept of SaaS and why it has become a dominant model in today’s software landscape. This foundation prepares you for understanding the business and technical needs of building and launching a SaaS product. You’ll start by setting up your environment, installing Python, configuring Django, and using Visual Studio Code, ensuring you have the tools needed for professional development.\nIn the early sections, you'll learn about Django, one of the most robust frameworks in Python, essential for building scalable web applications. You’ll learn to create, organize, and manage Django projects and apps, diving deep into authentication and user management. This course places strong emphasis on security, teaching you to build a custom user model, create secure login and registration flows, and integrate password reset options—each reinforced with hands-on examples to ensure understanding and mastery.\nOnce the authentication system is established, you’ll build a basic Todo application, which serves as the core feature for our SaaS project. This Todo app will involve CRUD operations, form management, and template creation, offering an in-depth experience with Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) structure. These lessons ensure you understand the essential building blocks of any web application, preparing you to create dynamic, interactive features for your users.\nThe advanced section focuses on transforming this Todo app into a SaaS product by integrating Stripe. You’ll learn how to set up a Stripe account, generate API keys, and securely handle payments. Through Stripe integration, you’ll gain practical experience in developing a subscription model, creating custom pricing plans, and ensuring that your app can monetize user engagement. These skills are essential in the growing SaaS industry, allowing you to design apps that generate recurring revenue.\nVersion control and deployment skills are also emphasized, with modules on Git and GitHub integration. You’ll explore Git for managing project versions, collaborating with team members, and tracking changes in a streamlined manner. With GitHub, you’ll learn to manage repositories and ensure your project is always safe, collaborative, and ready for updates.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have completed a project-ready, subscription-based Todo application, equipped with all essential features of a SaaS product, from authentication and task management to membership plans and payment processing. This course is ideal for beginners in web development, intermediate developers looking to enhance their SaaS skills, and entrepreneurs interested in creating a scalable software product. Through practical, step-by-step instruction, you’ll leave this course ready to build, deploy, and manage SaaS applications on your own.\nRequired Skills, Experience, Tools, or Equipment\nSkills and Experience: Basic programming knowledge (preferably in Python) and a fundamental understanding of HTML/CSS are helpful but not required. Familiarity with web development concepts, although not mandatory, will aid in understanding the technical discussions.\nTools and Equipment:\nA computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux\nInternet connection for accessing tools and resources\nVisual Studio Code (or other IDE)\nPython 3.x installed\nAccess to Git and GitHub for version control\nIntended Learners\nThis course is ideal for:\nAspiring web developers interested in learning the entire process of building a web application from scratch.\nEntrepreneurs and business owners aiming to understand the mechanics of SaaS applications, particularly those interested in building subscription-based products.\nIntermediate developers who want to deepen their knowledge of Django, authentication, and payment integration.\nStudents studying web development or software engineering who need hands-on, project-based learning.\nWith minimal prerequisites, this course supports those with a passion for learning, making it accessible for beginners while providing depth and rigor for more advanced learners. Whether your goal is a career in web development or creating a personal project, this course offers the toolkit to bring your ideas to life.",

If you've never used Django before, this is the course for you.\nDjango is one of the most popular web frameworks written in the Python programming language. Django and Python are both open source and free to use commercially. This means you don't have to pay a dime to create amazing software and impact people all around the world. Django powers many websites in the world including: Instagram, Pinterest, NASA, Baserow, this website, and so many others.\nThe goal of this course to teach you the fundamentals of Django while also creating a very practical project. Building something real is important because it gives you the context of how, when, and where to use a lot of Django's great features.\nDjango sits right in the middle of creating an app from scratch and using something like Wordpress. This means we have a lot of features we could implement along with a lot of features that just work by default. This makes Django incredibly flexible so that we can go far beyond what a blogging platform offers while being faster than starting from absolute 0.\nFor our User Interface, we're going to learn the fundamentals of Bootstrap. Bootstrap makes our Django project look far more professional in very little time. Not only that, we'll also have a much better user experience by leveraging many of Bootstrap's built-in features.\nIf we were building a house, Django would be the plumbing, the walls, and electricity while Bootstrap is the interior decorator.\nHere's a few things we'll cover:\nDjango version 4.1 (or even 2.2+)\nPython version 3.10 (or 3.8+)\nBootstrap 5.2+\nCollecting data from users\nRendering HTML templates and documents\nPassword-protected pages & user-type permissions\nModeling data in Django as it relates to a spreadsheet\nDynamically display content based on stored database data\nMuch more",

Learn how to use lookaheads, lookbehinds, anchors and unicode properly\n10. Learn the latest ES6, 7 and 8+ updates of Javascript regular expressions.\n\n\nHow is this course designed?\nOur course has 4 modules, where each module will thoroughly explain the intricacies of one of the concepts in Regular expression (with Javascript) with a wealth of over-the-shoulder examples.\nWe'll be using a real world example to explain the concepts.\nHere are the modules:\nModule 1 - Introduction - This is the foundations module. We'll look into what regular expressions are, how to create very basic expressions and test them without using any code.\nModule 2 - Using regular expressions in Javascript - In this module, you'll learn how to apply what you learned in the last module to Javascript. You'll also learn about various methods you can use to test regular expressions in Javascript, and we'll end the module with lessons on regex modifiers/flags.\nModule 3 - Brackets, character ranges, sets & more - In this module, we'll look at creating more complicated regular expressions using brackets, character ranges, sets, pipe symbol for options, character set exclusion and so much more.\nModule 4 - Metacharacters - In this module, you'll learn how to enhance your regular expressions with metacharacters that can be used to specify words, digits, whitespaces and more.\nModule 5 - Anchors and Quantifiers - In this module, you'll learn how to further perfect your regular expressions by quantifying your characters and sets and adding anchors.\nModule 6 - Literal/special characters - In this module, you'll learn how to specify special characters used elsewhere in regex literally as part of a pattern.\nModule 7 - RegExp object, properties and methods - In this module, you'll learn how to create the same regular expressions with the RegExp object and apply the various properties and methods that come along with it.\nModule 8 - Lazy and Greedy matching - In this module, you'll learn how to use lazy matching to simplify pattern matching in specific cases.\nModule 9 - Grouping and Capture groups - In this module, you'll learn how to create capture groups to get parts of matches, backreference them and so much more.\nModule 10 - Lookaheads and Lookbehinds - In this module, you'll learn how to use literally look ahead or behind a string before creating a match.\nWe also cover a lot of examples and real world projects, including:\n1. Project #1 - Remove extra spaces from start & end of a string - Trim a string without using Trim().\n2. Project #2 - E-mail validation\n3. Project #3 - Mobile number validation\n\n\nWhy should you choose our course?\n1. We like to be thorough in our teaching. You'll find everything you need to start creating complicated regular expression patterns. You won't have to look anywhere else.\n2. We strongly advocate learning by doing, rather than just listening or reading. Our lectures are filled with a wealth of examples that explain every concept clearly.\n3. If you follow along with our examples in our over-the-shoulder trainings, and create our examples with us, you'll have a thorough understanding of what regular expressions are, and how they work in Javascript. You'll be able to confidently add this as a skill in your resume.\n4. We prefer creating fun projects to explain the concepts and to keep things interesting as well. You'll learn how to apply the concepts you learn in the course in the real world projects and examples.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Enroll now and start creating complicated, yet accurate regex patterns that can be used in real world pattern matching scenarios in no time at all!",

      "description": "This video course introduces you to the powerful Cycles Render engine and more advanced materials for objects. Topics covered will range from organic modeling to node materials to particle systems.\nWe start with a basic understanding of the Cycles Render engine including the differences between the standard and ray-traced engines. After this we delve into organic modeling techniques using curves to create more natural and smooth shapes typically seen in the real world. Next we understand the concept of UV unwrapping to map textures and other 2D media to a 3D object using seams, while also learning how to tweak and modify UV maps as well as multi-channel U layers. The next part will cover a basic setup for a simple Cycles material shader, which includes simple materials, alpha cut-outs, as well as multi-channel and PBR material shaders to create an extensive range of realistic material shaders for the Cycles Render engine ; you will also acquire a good understanding of how the material node editor works. Moving on we will look at object-based lighting and 360 HDRI environment maps to control an entire scene's lighting; you will learn how lighting can affect a scene and which lighting sources you should use. After that we will learn about simple particle systems, hair/fur generation, and how to instantiate objects. You will utilize particle systems to greatly speed up your workflow, making it easier to generate large scenes with hundreds or thousands of objects. Finally, you will learn about fundamental composting workflows through the node editor and use Color management to give a more authentic and photographic image; this will include more advanced composting techniques such as light flares, depth of field, and adding additional external images to the final render.\nBy the end of the video course you should have a good understanding of how to add advanced post processing to an image before saving it and how to effectively create a realistic scene using the Cycles Render engine.\nAbout the author\nTim Crellin is a distinguished 3D generalist with over 5 years' experience working with 3D software for game development, animation, and 3D modeling.

The surge in smartphones and tablets have paved the way for many developers to display their creative side with these apps and websites.\nHowever, creating a responsive website is not exactly the easiest task. It requires learning numerous languages for different platforms and also having to constantly duplicate and modify the coding based on the browser or platform on which the website is going to be displayed.\nThis frustration has been the force behind the development of jQuery Mobile.\njQuery Mobile, created by the jQuery Project, is a JavaScript library that eliminates the need for developers to code in different languages for different platforms. Instead, it works by creating a seamless viewing experience using the easiest coding language out there (jQuery), no matter which platform.\nJQuery Mobile is a platform that allows developers to create responsive websites and apps that can work on a variety of smartphones and tablets, drastically reducing the amount of coding required to achieve cross-platform compatibility.\nHere’s your chance to compete with the big coders and stand out from the crowd. Develop responsive apps and websites using jQuery at half the time, so you can focus on what really matters – your creativity.\nOur course has been designed by experts to help you master jQuery Mobile. The jQuery Mobile tutorial will start from the very beginning, covering basic concepts and progressing to more advanced concepts. The hands-on jQuery mobile course will teach you how to efficiently use the most flexible front-end framework to help you design mobile-friendly and seamless websites.\nThe course will cover topics such as basic jQuery, HTML5 docs, jQuery in mobile browsers, jQuery Mobile styling, navigation and transitions, jQuery lists and buttons. Forms, Layouts, Event handlers, and so much more. At the end of this course, you will also create a fully-functional project to get some practical experience.\nAdditionally, this is also your chance to learn the brand new jQuery Themeroller for Mobile. A theme customizer that allows you to easily design your webpage as well as change its colors and themes with a few simple clicks.\nWith so much to learn, what are you waiting for?

      "description": "Hi there, my name is Kaushik Roy Chowdhury. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional and hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Auckland University of  Technology (AUT).\nAre you struggling to containerize your ASP.NET Core 3.1 applications in general and ASP.NET Core 3.1 Blazor applications in particular? This course will allow you to use Docker professionally for creating highly portable containers across all types of hosts including on cloud like Microsoft Azure. You would be able to add Docker and DevOps skills to your resume and be ahead of the pack for a great leap in your software development career.\nIn this course, I will teach you everything you need to know about getting started with Docker for containerizing Blazor and in general any ASP.NET Core web applications. You'll learn how to use Docker Desktop for use in Blazor applications and host it on the Microsoft Azure cloud. It will show you the steps to create an automated pipeline for continuous deployment on Azure.\nOne of the many highlights of this course is the use of Visual Studio 2019 as well as the Visual Studio Code (at the end) as IDE for development.\nThere is a section at the end on working with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which is the latest cutting edge contribution from Microsoft that lets the developers use Linux tools and distributions right from within Windows 10 OS without having to install any virtual machine and/or using Apple Mac OS or a dedicated Linux Operating System. This technology has endeared development on Windows more than ever before. This section makes sure that the learners are able to create docker containers in Linux on Windows 10 OS.\nThe course is for beginners. You do not need any previous knowledge of docker, images, Blazor, or Azure. We shall start from the very beginning and work our way through step by step.\nHere are some of my earlier reviews from other courses on Udemy:\n\"Great material. Learned a lot.\"  - John Taylor (Master Collection Classes in C# Using Visual Studio)\n\"Kaushik's courses are my main reference for anything C# - I find his explanations full of detail which helps to solidify a full understanding of even the most complex aspects of C# programming.\" - Martin Catherall (Microsoft MVP) - Master Collection Classes in C# Using Visual Studio\n\"to whom all want to know what is MongoDB and use it with MVC Core i would strongly recommend you to attend in this course . i find the way how he is presenting the course it's like at college when the Professor start with explaining the concept of the subject then get in practices. the last section 7 you will do more code with him with the good explanation\" - Abdalla Ben Omran (ASP.NET Core 3 with MVC and MongoDB)\n\"An elaborate and detailed description for a beginner. The author has put a lot of effort into structuring the content. Certainly proved useful to me as a starter.\" - Sudeep Ghatak (ASP.NET Core 3 with MVC and MongoDB)\nWell explained in detail. - Fred Handal (Build and Learn ASP.NET Core 3.1 Blazor Hands-On\nIt's a nice introduction into Blazor server side where you got a good understanding of Blazor fundamentals - Seb Lowe (Build and Learn ASP.NET Core 3.1 Blazor Hands-On)\nN.B. I have renamed my course \"DevOps and Docker Support for .NET Core Blazor\" to \"Learn Docker and DevOps and Containerize ASP.NET Core Blazor\" to reflect the essence and flavor of this course better. The course content remains the same with only the name changed.\n\n\nKaushik\n\n\n#Docker #Containers #Azure #DevOps",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking\nIt supports automatic garbage collection\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting",

The actual WordPress backend is pre built and I will not show how to build that. The sole purpose of this course is to teach Gatsby and how you can use Gatsby to create a Front End from a WordPress CMS. The purpose is NOT to show how the complete site is built with WordPress.\nAre you a developer that like “code along” style learning? Do you want to learn Gatsby.js fundamentals in a real world project oriented course? Do you like quick learning and straight down to the point? Then this is the course for you!\nIn this course we’re building a real world website in Gatsby.js\nMy teaching style and belief is that you learn more by creating many smaller projects than one overwhelming 25 + hours course that tries to show you everything and don’t focus on the fundamentals that much. So this is a shorter, project oriented, course where You’ll learn how to create a real world client site from scratch with Gatsby.js. Gatsy uses GraphQL by default so this is an awesome way to start with some GraphQL.\n\nWhat this course is!\nThis is an intermediate course. I assume that you know some Javascript and React\nThis is a quite fast paced project oriented course to learn the fundamentals of Gatsby.js\nThis is a course were you will learn GraphQL basics.\nThis is a “code along” style of course.\nThis is a course were you will learn how to connect an existing WordPress site to Gatsby.js and use it as a Headless CMS.\nThis is a course were you will use React. It will not teach basics of React but it should be good for an intermediate React developer.\nThis is a course that uses a lot of ES6 Syntax.\nWhat this course IS NOT!\nThis course is not a beginner React course\nThis course will not deeply explain React syntax.\nThis course will not teach GraphQL in detail. (We will use it though and should be a great overview/start to learn GraphQL)\nThis course will not teach WordPress and how the actual WordPress backend is built. We’re not building anything in WordPress. The course is focused to learn Gatsby.js and how to connect an existing WordPress site to Gatsby.\nMy main goal with this course is to mix fun with teaching. There’s many tutorials and courses out there that are great but too complex and focus on a lot at the same time. Hope you enjoy it too!\nPlease make sure to download the STARTER FILES from the resources!",

Dennis Ritchie developed the C language and it has known as the mother of programming languages. It has nearly been four decades since the C programming language invention and yet it is in use in many applications today. The invention of the C language made the usage of languages like COBOL, PASCAL, and FORTRAN obsolete. The C language is widely in use today. Many other programming languages have their programming structure evolved from the C language just like the C++ and C# programming languages. The C language is very robust and it could be used to implement many programs, software, and applications. Any person who is interested in learning programming should first make sure that he/she has a strong basic background in C programming language. A person who masters the varied aspects of the C programming language can master any other programming language with relative ease.\nWhy you should take this course\n1. 69 lectures, 9 Sections, and 6 quizzes\n2.

The course is a practical, hands-on approach to learning through practice. You learn best when you code along with the examples.\n\n\nResources\nAll example apps are in custom-react-hooks-course Zip, In Lecture 1. > Introduction.",

      "description": "Update: Join over 11,500 students in the Techustler Course Series. You don’t want to miss this learning opportunity.\nIf you ever wanted to understand the space of Voice Apps or build them yourself, then take my course \"Intermediate Amazon Alexa Development\". I designed it in a practical way so that when you finish the content you can immediately put it into use with your Amazon Echo or online counterpart.\nNow, why should you build Alexa Skills?\nThe biggest industries in technology are surrounded by AI, Bots, and Voice technology. Voice technology I believe will be the new 21st user interface that will not only understand basic commands, but will be so smart to understand anything you tell it. This is why Amazon is making a big bet with Alexa which it plans to generate close to $11 billion dollars by 2020. They know something about Amazon Echo which is why now is the best time to learn these skills before the mainstream starts developing applications. We all know the story about apps for the smartphones, this is the same thing.\nThis course contains over 50 lectures and 1.5 hrs of content. It's designed for beginners to play with new platforms in the voice space. You’ll learn the tools needed to build Alexa Skills, how Alexa Skills work, and eventually publish a skill to Amazon's Alexa store.\nCourse Structure\nThe course follows a familiar structure where in each video I will teach the concepts followed by a challenge or practice question. If your goal is to become a better developer, you should understand node.js, server side development and how to access certain APIs to build better Alexa Skills.\n1. Learn about the new AWS Lambda and Alexa Developer Services Interfaces. (Updated July 2018)\n2. Learn how to design an Alexa Skill through Voice User Principles\n3. Learn Basic Javascript Development with a hint of Nodejs framework\n4. Understand Alexa Skill Development: Intent Schemas, Slots, Invocation Names, Lambda functions, Endpoints\n5. Understand OAuth and how Account Linking works with Skills\n6. Connect with Third Party APIs (Game of Thrones API) to process information and output results\n7. Learn to create multi-sessions, save data with DynamoDB, debug with AWS Cloudwatch\n8. Create Alexa Skills through the Command Line Interface (CLI)\n9. Use the following technologies: AWS Lambda, AWS Cloudwatch, AWS DynamoDB, Alexa Command Line Interface (CLI), Alexa IAM\nEnvironment Setup\nThis course aims to simulate a live in-person course as much as possible. After you finish each lecture, you should practice and try the solution on your own. You learn the best by practicing and doing.\nChallenges\nAt the end of each section, you will be asked to complete a challenge to test your knowledge in Alexa Development.\nTestimonials from other Techustler Courses and the Instructor\n“Great set of videos Nick! I really liked the format of the videos with you in the corner of the screen showing us how to use the website. Cool songs you use at the beginning of each video. It really gives off the vibe that your course is hip and up-to-date with modern times. You do a great job of keeping of with the times. Stay modern, but classy at the same time Nick!” - Penelope\n“Nicholas, very good course on bots! I especially enjoyed that you provided us the opportunity to build bots in a hands-on fashion. Your course sections are very organized and I didn't have to guess to know what I was getting myself into. It is clear you are very knowledgeable as an instructor and have a real connection to your course material. I look forward to taking another course with you!” - Rahul\n\"This is a great course. Teacher is clear at every step. We learn concrete skills to get hands on experience....that is how one should learn. Thank you for making this course available!\" - Janice Cook\n\"Nick teaches Alexa at a nice pace. Content is updated.\" - Nadine Fisher\n\"This course is fantastic! It got me up and running on Alexa in very little time. There are a couple places I had to debug a little to get it running, but I look at it as good exercise.\" - Craig Dugas\nWhat is the target audience?\nThis course is designed for people with little or no experience in javascript which is needed to make Alexa skills. By the end of the course, you’ll have valuable skills that will help you be creative and resourceful in your pursuit of building products (hopefully in the voice space :)\nNext Steps\nNow it's time to become a Techustler and join me in registering for the course. I can’t wait to have you on board!",

Also, she shares the secret techniques of HTML and CSS to make you an expert. Just like our other popular and award-winning courses, this course includes lot of preview videos for you to get an advanced idea of the materials. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it has been the mother of markup languages to create baseline structure and contents for websites. HTML targets browser-based software applications for design. HTML code structure includes pair of tags. Web browsers typically read html documents and convert them into visible web elements for users. HTML closely works with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for customizing the look and feel of web contents. The process of inventing this amazing language started in the 1980s by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. Lee created the first coding of HTML in the 1990s. HTML also helps us to interpret and compose text, images and other material on web pages. No one can step into Website Design without the knowledge of HTML. HTML training and HTML tutorial videos are vastly available since it is a mandatory skill for web designers, but it has been difficult to find free HTML training videos that discuss all basic and secret recipes from scratch. Also, we often make HTML concepts sound boring and difficult. As a result, new comers may lose interest in web design from the beginning of their learning. A professional web design course often costs us a fortune. Erudeversity is committed to make it easier for everyone. Our set of HTML tutorials and free html training videos discuss basic and advanced HTML concepts from scratch and we like to keep the doors open for everyone without any fee! No matter where you come from, getting into the web design industry don’t have to cost a fortune anymore. All you need is a little bit of passion to learn web design. By the end of the HTML videos, you will become a master in basic website design. Now everyone can learn the required HTML concepts including Addressing web pages, HTML writing platform, overview of notepad++, writing first line of HTML code, proclaiming headings, adding paragraphs, color and formatting, adding images to your web page, inserting background images, Adding link, craeting submit forms, adding multimedia/sound on web page. We also discussed the CSS concepts for customizing the look and feel of the web pages. At the end, we walk you through the process of publishing your first web page. So what are you waiting for? Get started and become a website developer from scratch and master web development techniques to reach the top level of success in this industry.",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn all the concepts of Hibernate and Spring Data JPA to get ready for an Interview.\n\n\nYou will learn about the following:\n\n\nHibernate ORM Framework - JPA Implementation\n\n\nHibernate has a layered architecture that helps the user to operate without having to know the underlying APIs. Hibernate makes use of the database and configuration data to provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.\n\n\nHibernate Application Architecture with its important core classes.\n\n\nConfiguration Object\n\n\nThe Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application. It is usually created only once during application initialization.\n\n\nThe Configuration object provides two keys components −\n\n\nDatabase Connection configuration\n\n\nClass Mapping Setup\n\n\nSessionFactory Object\n\n\nConfiguration object is used to create a SessionFactory object.\n\n\nThe SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.\n\n\nWe would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration.\n\n\nSession Object\n\n\nA Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.\n\n\nTransaction Object\n\n\nA Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality. Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA-Java Transaction API).\n\n\nQuery Object\n\n\nQuery objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to execute the query.\n\n\nCriteria Object(Filtered Select query with many Where condition)\n\n\nCriteria objects are used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects.\n\n\nHIBERNATE OBJECT STATES\n\n\nA new instance of a persistent class which is not associated with a Session, has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by Hibernate:\n// person is in a transient state\n\n\nA persistent instance has a representation in the database, an identifier value and is associated with a Session. You can make a transient instance persistent by associating it with a Session:\n\n\nNow, if we close the Hibernate Session, the persistent instance will become a detached instance: it isn't attached to a Session anymore (but can still be modified and reattached to a new Session later though).\n\n\nHIBERNATE CACHING\n\n\nCaching is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. It is a buffer memory that lies between the application and the database. Cache memory stores recently used data items in order to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible.\n\n\nCaching is important to Hibernate as well. It utilizes a multilevel caching scheme as explained below −\n\n\nFirst-level Cache\n\n\nThe first-level cache is the Session cache and is a mandatory cache through which all requests must pass. The Session object keeps an object under its own power before committing it to the database.\n\n\nSecond-level Cache\n\n\nSecond level cache is an optional cache and first-level cache will always be consulted before any attempt is made to locate an object in the second-level cache. The second level cache can be configured on a per-class and per-collection basis and mainly responsible for caching objects across sessions.\n\n\nQuery-level Cache\n\n\nHibernate also implements a cache for query resultsets that integrates closely with the second-level cache.\n\n\nThis is an optional feature and requires two additional physical cache regions that hold the cached query results and the timestamps when a table was last updated. This is only useful for queries that are run frequently with the same parameters.\n\n\nJPA offers 4 different ways to generate primary key values: @Id\n\n\nAUTO: Hibernate selects the generation strategy based on the used dialect,\n\n\nIDENTITY: Hibernate relies on an auto-incremented database column to generate the primary key,\n\n\nSEQUENCE: Hibernate requests the primary key value from a database sequence,\n\n\nTABLE: Hibernate uses a database table to simulate a sequence.\n\n\nSPRING DATA JPA - Abstraction layer built on top of Hibernate\n\n\nSpring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.\n\n\nImplementing a data access layer of an application has been cumbersome for quite a while. Too much boilerplate code has to be written to execute simple queries as well as perform pagination, and auditing. Spring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that’s actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.",

      "description": "Electron helps us develop cross-platform applications by using existing web technologies. You don't need specific skills, for most cases, to develop apps with Electron. If you are a web developer and are interested in developing an app with Electron, then make sure you check out tutorials that will follow this article in this series.\nIf you want your application to be available for all the platforms we talked about, you need to deploy your app using different technologies. This is very manual and time-consuming. Now, if we talk about Electron, it is obvious that this is a JavaScript-based framework. Because all the platforms support web technologies, Electron helps in developing cross-platform apps easier. Popular applications that use Electron include Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Atom Editor.\nElectron Features\nSecurity\nYou don’t need to think much when migrating your existing application to Electron as the application we are creating is a desktop application and data stays locally in the system. Because of this, you can ensure data security. In case you need to store data in the cloud, check whether your cloud network has enough security functions beforehand to avoid any unwanted surprises.\nLow-Level Accessibility\nBefore starting out, you also have to check whether all the functionalities you are providing for your desktop application are also available in Electron. In my experience, Electron provides enough control to have the extended interactive features in your application, such as Keyboard Shortcuts. It also provides low-level accessibility to the hardware and operations system components.\nHardware Accessibility\nDevelopers can get complete access to the all hardware level access APIs expose over the JavaScript/Plugin. There is no need to compromise for the feature if you want to migrate to Electron.\nPerformance\nElectron thrives in this aspect. If proper care is taken while developing (load only what you need), Electron can show some great gains in the terms of performance when compared to native applications. Electron saves a lot of time and provides more options to play with or develop by having a single code base for all the major platforms. These are the major problems when we deal with the native development of applications, which are all effectively solved by Electron.\nHowever, a lot of people say that Electron is very memory hungry. I agree with this statement, but only if you develop the applications without proper care.\nCode and App Management\nAs a Product Owner, you don’t need to maintain different teams for each platform and you will be relieved from the hassle of re-explaining your requirements with different teams. It will also reduce the auditing work to make sure the product has the same functionality across platforms.\nAs a developer, you need not worry about different codebases. If you encounter a bug on any platform, you can fix it at the code base. The bug will never show up on other platforms. However, you should still keep an eye on the OS level functionalities.\nReusability\nBecause we are using a single code base, it means we can use this for both web applications and desktop applications. We are, in a way, also reusing the base code across different platforms since we “code once, distribute everywhere.”\nProduction\nThe more known frameworks we use, the more support we get. This, in turn, gives us more open source libraries we can reuse and the decreased time to production but with more features.\nDeployment/Build\nThis is one of the interesting aspects of Electron. There is an electron-packager module available that helps us bundle the whole code base into the respective packages. Although people debate that Electron takes a lot of memory, as I said, Electron needs a little care during development to avoid this.\nUI/UX\nWith web technologies, you are open to multiple technologies that provide great User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) to all your users with great comfort. Also, you can be sure that you are providing the same experience to all your users across different platforms.\nCost and Time\nYou will save a lot of development time and money because, for the tech stack we use, there are a lot of developers who can do it for less and achieve good results. You can save a lot of time using the single code base and any developer can work on anything.\nHistory of Electron\nWhen we talk about any technology we need to talk a little about the history behind it. Let's briefly look at the history of Electron.\nElectron was founded by Cheng Zhao, during the development of Atom a cross-platform text editor released in July 2013. It was made open source, developed, and supported by GitHub using C++, JavaScript, Objective C, and Python. It was intended to make cross-platform development easier for Atom creation.",

I'll show you how to connect to Google's Firebase real-time database in a straightforward manner. Of course, we'll use some of the fundamental dependencies to connect spring boot to firebase. I'll use a maven-based configuration.\n\n\nI'm going to show you a sample spring boot application that performs a simple crud operation on a Firebase real-time DB. So, first and foremost, we must initialise our application using the spring initializer and then extract and import the downloaded project into your preferred IDE.\n\nWhen it comes to building an enterprise-based application, Spring 5 is a popular web framework for back-end development among Java developers.\nIt is incredibly large because it is made up of several modules and projects.\n\n\nThe Spring Framework and Spring Boot enable developers to construct corporate Java applications that are high-performing, reusable, easily testable, and loosely coupled. Spring Boot is a tool for getting started very quickly with Spring applications. Spring Boot Focuses attention at a single point and Control a large collection of spring-* projects. Spring Boot allows a user to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring Applications and Exposes a lot of useful features by default.\n\n\nIt may be used to create any Java program.\n\n\nSpring framework knowledge is in high demand in the enterprise market, and Spring framework developers are well compensated.\nThe fact that you have Spring Framework on your CV will set you apart from other Java developers.",

      "description": "If you are a beginner developer or a seasoned one, it doesn't matter. I have designed this course to cater to both the beginner and the seasoned developers. This course is designed to get you start building full stack web apps really fast and do it right and safe way. What do I mean? We will use TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript to make sure that the code we write is type-safe and we get early warnings for errors that would otherwise be hard to predict until they actually occurred in production. TypeScript provides features like static typing, enhanced IDE support, strict null checks (null errors have historically been most notorious), etc. And don't worry! TypeScript if largely interoperable with JavaScript, though it might require some hacks at times when using js libs with Typescript.\n\n\nYes, so the course if targeting a larger audience and thus feel free to skip certain sections as per your needs. If you are a beginner developer, or new to web development some advanced concepts might not be very relevant to you immediately. Or if you are already familiar with modern JS and react JS, you might want to skip those sections. However, I have tried to make this course comprehensive as well as concise. I have tried to include as much depth and breadth of the concepts in an easy to understand yet concise fashion as possible. So, I recommend you to at least skim through the entire course with 2x speed if you like.\n\n\nNext.js is a production-ready, full-stack-capable framework for React JS - one of the most popular JavaScript UI library you can learn these days!\n\n\nIndeed, Next JS is a great choice for growing as a React developer and for taking your React apps to the next level!\n\n\nBecause Next JS is growing fast and therefore in high demand. And there are good reasons for that: Next JS allows you to build React apps with built-in server-side rendering, static rendering, page pre-rendering and automatic prefetching pages related to the current page. Building great user experiences and search engine friendly (SEO!) React apps has never been easier!\n\n\nIn addition, Next JS makes building full-stack React apps (frontend + backend code combined in one project) extremely easy as well! Blend client-side and server-side code and build a Node JS-based API side-by-side with your frontend React apps. It's a breeze with Next JS!\n\n\nThis course contains a few explanatory lessons, a few challenges, quizzes and  assignments and a lot of hands on coding and screencasts. First we introduce you to next js, give a brief introduction to get you motivated about what you are going to accomplish after completing this course. Then we jump into learning/refreshing modern JS practices that are most commonly used in React community. We will do all these right in our Next.JS app setup! So, you will already start building the complete websites with Next.js even before we start digging into the Next.js concepts. Thirdly, we will cover React JS concepts with fair enough depth. We will stick just to React and will not cover things like React Router, Redux, the commonly used webpack configurations etc., which should be a part of a complete React course. However, when using Next JS, you really don't need any of these for most cases. Or you need to use Redux or manipulate webpack configs directly only in rare cases. Finally, we will dig into the Next JS features and master them while creating multiple projects.\n\n\nThis course will take you from a mere acquaintance to React and Next JS to advanced Next JS full stack developer in no time!\n\n\nWe'll start at the very basics, no Next JS, react or modern JS knowledge is required at all. Though you should be familiar with the basic programing concepts and JavaScript. We will learn both in theory as well as with multiple real projects where all concepts will be applied step-by-step.\n\n\nAfter finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own Next JS projects from the ground up and apply for Next JS positions!\n\n\nIn detail, this course will cover:\nWhat is NextJS? And why would you use it?\nWhy is just React (in many cases) not enough?\nCreating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects\nWorking with file-based routing\nAdding dynamic routes and catch-all routes\nImplementing different forms of page static-rendering and server-side rendering\nWorking with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps\nPre-generating dynamic and static pages\nAdding optimizations like metadata to pages\nOptimizing images with the NextJS Image component\nBuilding fullstack apps with API routes\nManaging app-wide state with React context (in Next JS apps)\nMultiple complete apps where we'll apply all these core concepts!\nA complete React.js crash course/refresher module\nAnd much more!\n\n\nI can't wait to start this journey together with you! :)",

      "description": "React Hooks are the latest features of React. They were introduced in version 16.8. If you want to keep your React knowledge up-to-date then you definitely should learn React Hooks.\nBut what is a React Hook?\nA React Hook is a function which lets you hook into function components and use the React features like lifecycle methods and state. Before React Hooks this was only possible with class components.\nWhy you should learn it?\nEven though the creators of React do not recommend migrating existing codebase to React Hooks but they strongly suggest that you create your new components using React Hooks. So if you want to keep up with React then it's time you learned React Hooks.\nWhat can you learn in this course?\nThis course introduces React Hooks from the beginning. We're going to look at some of the mostly used built in Hooks (useState, useEffect). We'll create our own React Hook as well, so after this course you'll be able to create your own React Hook. We're going to finish this course by creating a Weather App which is going to call a real API to fetch real weather data. This course will give you the solid foundations of React Hooks which then you can apply to your projects too.\nWhen is this course not for you?\nI want to be upfront here. This course is not for you if you've created many projects with React Hooks, you already know the main concepts of React Hooks and you've created your own custom Hooks as well. This course gives an introduction to React Hooks though we're going to cover the two most used built in React Hooks extensively.",

A number of organizations are not there yet due to the cost of implementation. But in this course, we are going to see how easy it is to actually design, develop and deploy a complete and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation software system.\n\n\nPaper-based monitoring and evaluation process have a number of limitations, although they are very easy to create and organizations already have the skills and tools they need to create them. They don’t deliver as at when due.\n\n\nBesides the Paper-based solution, the use of MS Excel has also been adopted and is widely used by development professionals. As a result, it’s easy for them to dive straight in without extra training.\nAs earlier mentioned, there are clear visible problems with these methods. Capturing data on paper and then collating various spreadsheets is time consuming and prone to error. Managers also don’t have clear oversight into what is happening in real-time. Monitoring & Evaluation indicators are only available after all the data has been entered, compiled and analyzed. This means that if there are any issues, management might not realize until they receive a 6 monthly report. It also means that decisions will be made by management based on outdated data.\nBut with the web based monitoring and evaluation solution, the reverse will be the case. Organizations will be able to\nCollect their project monitoring data as close to source as possible.\nAccess real-time updates on specific projects, review and criticize incorrect data entries.\nView overall and specific project summaries using dashboard charts and tables\n•Convert an entire report with dashboard charts and tables to PDF with a single click of a button\nFeedback useful information to staff, in a timely manner.\nEnable management to make decisions in real time\nReduce cost on project field visits\nReduce cost on overall staff manpower\nIncrease project transparency and visibility\nIncrease trust and accountability\nDo a lot more with less cost.",

      "description": "Prisma is a next-generation object–relational mapper (ORM) that claims to help developers build faster and make fewer errors. Prisma takes a different approach to ORMs compared to traditional ORMs. It uses a custom Schema Definition Language (SDL) that automatically writes migrations and generates type-safe code.\nWhy Prisma?\nORMs facilitate implementing the domain model. The domain model is an object model that incorporates the behavior and data of your business logic. In other words, it allows you to focus on real business concepts rather than the database structure or SQL semantics.\nORMs help reduce the amount of code. They save you from writing repetitive SQL statements for common CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations and escaping user input to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injections.\nORMs require you to write little to no SQL (depending on your complexity you may still need to write the odd raw query). This is beneficial for developers who are not familiar with SQL but still want to work with a database.\nMany ORMs abstract database-specific details. In theory, this means that an ORM can make changing from one database to another easier. It should be noted that in practice applications rarely change the database they use.\nIn this course, we are going to build the REST API in Prisma, Node, Express, and Postgres",

      "description": "In this Course, you will learn from basic to advanced features of GraphQL API design using Spring for GraphQL with Springboot 3 framework including Spring Reactive Web Applications.\nEarlier, you need to write more java codes of GraphQL-Java to implement query, mutation or subscription. After springboot version 2.7, Spring for GraphQL released, which helped developers immensely with its annotation based architecture. In this course, we will develop GraphQL microservice APIs using Springboot 3 and Spring for GraphQL framework.\nNow-a-days, GraphQL is gaining its popularity over REST apis. In my experience, I have seen many projects move towards GraphQL mostly because of its Query features which retrieves data exactly what the client has requested for. In this course, I have extensively covered all the features of GraphQL Query including custom scalars, directives and paginations for this purpose.\nThis course is mostly hands-on and java programming based, I have focused more on how to implement GraphQL services rather that on the theoretical aspects. This course covers GraphQL Query, Mutation, Subscription as well as advanced topics like extended scalars (using external jars), directives, cursor paginations etc. You will also learn about exception handling and how to use interceptors. In any API development, writing unit test cases or integration test cases is a must, hence, you will learn that as well using Spring GraphQLTester apis.\nIn the later part of the course, with basic pre-requisite knowledge of WebSocket, Reactive Socket (Rsocket) and reactive programming, you will learn how to develop GraphQL apis in reactive web project as well. You will also learn how to integrate GraphQL with Apache Kafka, specially how to consume Kafka messages using GraphQL Subscription easily and effectively.\nAfter completion of the course, you will be able to write complete GraphQL microservice applications using Spring framework (both Web and Reactive Web) with most its features including test cases.",

Following this, we will integrate API calls and manage data in Redux Toolkit using createApi and useDataQuery. Additionally, we will implement search, filter, and sorting functionalities on the home page. Furthermore, we will perform cart actions such as adding items to the cart and getting the cart total, manage cart item component actions (increase and decrease quantity, clearing the cart, and remove items from the cart), and integrate animated notifications.\n\n\nProject 2:\nWe will begin by configuring Express with MongoDB using Mongoose. We will emphasize secure user authentication by utilizing JWT, Bcrypt, and Express-Validator. Progressing, we will implement robust CRUD operations for the Story Model, ensuring seamless data management. By integrating Multer, we will enable effortless file uploads within the application. Shifting focus to the front-end, we will meticulously set up React (without TypeScript) with React Router Dom 6, enabling efficient routing within the application. Moreover, we will handle token authentication, manage error responses adeptly, and empower users to create stories with file uploads, enhancing interactivity. Finally, we will conclude the app by implementing update and delete functionalities for stories and incorporating author-based access control to maintain data security and integrity.",

In this course, we build a Laravel forum from scratch. For the students who subscribe to the course, I provide the theme we are going to use plus other materials that we use in this course.\nWhat We're going to build:\nForum Members\nIn this course, we build a forum. The forum has Categories and each category has forums. Each forum has discussions or topics the unauthenticated users can view the forums categories and the forums but they have to log in in order to start a discussion in any forum. Each discussion has replies. Replies have the like and dislike button displayed if the logged-in user is not the author of the reply. The number of likes and dislikes affects the user's rank.  Likes increase the user's rank while dislikes reduce the user's rank. When the user is logged in, he is redirected to the profile page where he/she can update their profile information. The forum displays all the logged-in users as well as the page for all the forum members.\n\n\nAdmin\nAdmin has total control of the forum. Admin has CRUD(CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE) permissions on the Categories, Forums, Discussions, Users, and Replies.\nAdmin has access to user's Profiles and Can Update them.\nNotifications\nUsers are notified upon someone replying on the discussion they started or When someone likes the reply. Admin is notified when a new user joins the Forum.\nTelegram API\nWe link the application with a telegram group so that notifications are sent to the group by the telegram bot upon new user registration, the new discussion started, and a new reply to the discussion.\nCategories Search\nOn the forum homepage, we have a search form where users can search specific keywords, and then they will be shown the categories with those keywords if they exist\nAccess Control\n\n\nWe implement access control where normal users can't access the admin panel whether they know the URL to the admin panel or not.  For this, we use admin middleware to redirect the non-admin users back to their profile page if at all they get the admin route and try to access it.\nUsers can also not edit other user's profiles.\nThe Laravel topics we're going to cover are: Laravel application structure, Laravel MVC, Laravel Controllers, Laravel Models, Laravel Mailable, Laravel Migrations, Laravel views, Laravel Observers, Laravel commands, Laravel Notificatifiable, Laravel Routes, Laravel Named Routes, Laravel Eloquent, Laravel Database,  Laravel blade template",

It is JavaScript that is used for the faster and easier development of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack is a technology that is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework for building applications and dynamic websites.\nMERN Stack consists of four main components or can say four main technologies:\nM stands for MongoDB ( Database ), mainly used for preparing document databases,s and is a NoSQL (Non-Structured Query Language ) Database System\nE stands for Express, mainly used for developing Node.js web framework\nR stands for React, mainly used for developing a client-side JavaScript framework\nN stands for js, mainly used for developing the premier JavaScript web server\n\n\nEach of these four technologies is important in providing an end-to-end framework for the developers. Even these four technologies play an important role in the development process of web applications.\nBefore MERN stack, it was earlier named as MEAN stack, MERN Stack is one of the variations of MEAN, here MEAN also comprises of four components or say four different technologies, i.e., M is for MongoDB, ' E ' is for Express, ' A ' is for Angular.js, and ' N ' is for Node, here if you will observe, then you can identify that in MEAN, ' A ', i.e., Angular.js is replaced by ' R ', i.e., React.js in MERN, the main reason behind is - MERN Stack is mainly used for faster development of smaller applications as compared with MEAN, MEAN stack is a mainly better option for large-scale applications. Still, it takes more time for the development of smaller applications. They also both have different structures comparatively.",

You want to let user be able to interact with it?\nOpenLayers is a JavaScript library that enables you to display and query data from multiple sources in order to build a dynamic map in any web page\nWhat is OpenLayers’ role in an open source web mapping stack? You will see in a few sequences how to create a map, add multiple layers, controls and events to interact with your map. Then you will see how to manage different data layer formats and projection. Finally, you will be able to improve your map to export it, and add support for mobile devices. Quiz and exercises will help you consolidate your new skills for each sequence.\nOf course, these first steps are required before working on bigger projects. A lot of other features are available in OpenLayers, as vector editing, distance and surface measurements, vector tiles, 3D.\nBut, before working with these complex features, we strongly recommend to start with this introduction to get straight in the OpenLayers API! Are you ready to code? Let's get started.\nThank you for selecting our introduction to OpenLayers.\nThe Camptocamp Training Team",

Imagine being able to build any kind of website you can imagine.\nii.) Imagine being able to render these services to clients worldwide and make up to $5,000 monthly.\niii.) Imagine being able to bring your long nursed idea into reality.\n\n\nINTRODUCING...\nTHE SMART WEB DEVELOPER COURSE:\nA Step-By-Step Video Tutorials that will teach you how to build any kind of website you can imagine using the four Major CMS, namely: WordPress, Magento, Joomla and Drupal\nAT THE END OF THIS COURSE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD...\nany kind of E-Commerce Platform you can imagine, even up to massive ones like the Amazon and Ebay.\nany kind of blog or news website you can think of like CNN Website.\nany kind of forum or community platform you can think of, like Digital Point, Warriors Forum, etc.\nany kind of business or servicing website you can think of, you can build such for yourself or for clients and make good money\nany kind of social media platform you can think of, like Facebook\nany kind of church website you can think of with different features\nany kind medical, health or fitness website you can think of with different features\n\n\nIn fact, any kind of website you can think of\n\n\n---Specials---\n...Also, in this course, you will also be shown how you can set up a Bulk Mailing Platform in your website and send unlimited mails to your prospects. Such Bulk Mailing Platform with Autoresponders like Getresponse or Aweber that you pay huge amount for. You can import and export mail lists. Do you have millions of emails, but you don't know how to reach them? Then, this will help you. This is what most gurus use to send bulk mails to you. Nobody will ever tell you this, but you're getting this for free in this course.\n...This course also reveals to you a hosting company that will give you a 30-day free trial without paying anything and without asking for your credit card details. Can you find such anywhere? Well, you're discovering that in this course\n...In this course, you'll also learn how to host websites beyond cpanel. You're also taught how you can also host your website using another Control Panel. With this, no hacker will know where your website is hosted, and so won't be able to hack into your website.\nThis Course is a Revolutionary\nThis Course is a Revolutionary. This is not wix or any other website builder you know. It shows you the basics of website building using Content Management Systems (CMS), like WordPress, Magento, Joomla and Drupal from Beginner to Expert. Build by yourself and host by yourself your own choice server.\nIt's not possible for you to take this course and not able to make impact with it, because the teacher has taken her time to pour out her heart for you. One of the students who purchased this course at the pre-launch phase was able to build a massive E-Commerce Platform for a client, even while he was still watching the videos. This was a job he returned because he couldn't deliver, although he had some knowledge in web development. But, while taking this course, he hadn't even gone far in watching the videos before he understood web development and how to build websites properly. And so, he quickly ran back and picked up the job, and delivered it with great excitement and without stress.\n...You're not alone...\nAs you take this course, you're not alone, we're right by your side in case you encounter errors. So, don't be scared, if you encounter any error or hitches in your journey, we're just right by you to show you the way out. And you have the opportunity to interact with your fellow students. You can brainstorm, ask one another questions, answer one another questions, discus ideas, network, etc\n\n\n---FACTS---\nIf I were you, I will learn a skill now, especially Web Design/Development Skill that will boost me in job market.\nIf you don't know, employers are now looking for what else you can do apart from your certificate. Everybody has a certificate, the only thing that makes you outstanding is what else you have to offer. And with your Web Development and digital marketing skills, no employer can tell you no. Personally, I get a lot of job offers everyday from employers, but I turn them down because I have no time. I'm already too busy doing personal and clients projects\n\n\nThis course is for everyone, irrespective of your current knowledge\nWhether you're a beginner, having little or no knowledge in Website Design/Development or you've been into Web Development before but you're not really sure of what you're doing, this Course will take you by the hand Step-by-Step from Beginner to Expert. So, you can decide to stop at the beginner level and build a simple website for yourself or go advance to become a highly sought after pro. It's up to you.\n\n\nSome people even paid for this course even before it was ready\nIn fact, someone who saw me in the Studio recording this Course and seeing the great information I was dishing out couldn't help but booked for the course. He didn't just book with lips, he actually paid for the course before it was ready. Now, this is a Family Man, who's also a computer Science Graduate. Knowing what he saw, and knowing that he didn't get such information in the University, grabbed the opportunity.\n\n\nYou're learning everything in one place\nImagine learning the five major Web Design/Development CMS (WordPress, Magento, Joomla and Drupal) in one place and be able to build any kind of website you can imagine. You can't find such combination anywhere else. Trust me\n\n\nYou're getting a 30-Day Free Hosting Trial\nImagine getting to know where you can host your website for 30 days as a free trial without having to pay first and without your credit card details (where does that happen?). Now, this will enable you learn, build and host websites on a live server without first having to purchase a hosting plan. Also, with this, you will be able to build and host sample projects for your clients to see over a distance\n\n\n---OTHER FACTS---\nYou're also learning hosting beyond CPanel\nBesides Cpanel, you're also going to learn how to host websites using another Control Panel. Imagine being able to host your website in another control panel, apart from cpanel that's prone to hackers, such that hackers will never know where your site is hosted let alone hacking into it.\n\n\nYou have to learn the basics of Web Design/Development before you can actually make good money online.\nSometimes, you buy high class Money Making Packages from top gurus, yet you're not really able to make money with it, while some others buy same package and make it big with the same. What then is the difference between you who's not able to make it and the other guy who's making it big with same package? The only difference is UNDERSTANDING. That guy who's able to make it big with that same Money Making Package that you regret over has a good understanding of the basics of the web way, starting from Web Design, Hosting, etc, why you don't. So, first, you have to learn the basics of how the web works before you can actually understand true Online Money Making.\n\n\nYou can choose to become a pro or non pro\nAfter taking this Course, you can set up your Web Development Business Empire and render the service to clients around the world. Or you can choose to just make it a personal thing, build your own business website and relax, or if you're too busy, you can even give it to your child who will just watch the videos and build a website for you, because, the course is made so ridiculously simple that, even a little child will understand it. By so doing, you're not only building your child future, you're also setting him on the path to becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\nThe digital is growing very fast\nLess than three years from now, if you don't know how to set up a simple website by yourself and manage it, then you'll will be far behind.\n\n\nYou too can rule the web\nA Lot will be revealed to you in this course. Those things you often see on the web, that you thought were very difficult, you're gonna see how easy it is to do them. Your time to control the web is now.\n...All these and many more...",

      "description": "What is Kafka\nKafka is a Publish/Subscribe messaging system. It allows producers to write records into Kafka that can be read by one or more consumers. These records that cannot be deleted or modified once they are sent to Kafka.\nProducers\nThe first component of Kafka is Producers. Producers create messages and send them to topics. The data or we can say that records are published to the topics by the producers. They can also assign the partition when it is publishing data to the topic. The producer can send data in a round robin way or it can implement a priority system based on sending records to certain partitions based on the priority of the record.\nKafka Cluster\nKafka uses a distributed clustering system. If you have any background in distributed systems, you already know that a Cluster is a group of computers acting together for a common purpose. Since Kafka is a distributed system, the cluster has the same meaning for Kafka. It is merely a group of computers, each executing one instance of Kafka broker.\n\n\nKafka Broker\nKAfka clusters are occurred from brokers. The broker is Kafka server. It is just a meaningful name given to Kafka server. And this title makes sense as well because all that Kafka does; is act as a message broker between producer and consumer. The producer and consumer do not interact directly. They use Kafka server as an agent or a broker to exchange messages.\nTopics\nAdditionally, each broker has a topic or topics. Records are published into topics. Kafka is run as a cluster in one or more servers and the cluster stores or retrieves the records in a feed called Topics. Each record in the topic is stored with a key, value, and timestamp.\nThe topics can have one or multiple consumers or subscribers.\n\n\nPartitions\nThe Kafka cluster uses a partitioned log for each topic. A record will be published in a single partition of a topic. Producers can choose the partition in which a record will be sent to, otherwise, the partition is chosen by Kafka.\nThe partition maintains the order in which data was inserted and once the record is published to the topic, it remains there depending on the retention period (which is configurable). The records are always appended at the end of the partitions. It maintains a flag called 'offsets,' which uniquely identifies each record within the partition.\nThe offset is controlled by the consuming applications. Using offset, consumers might backtrace to older offsets and reprocess the records if needed.\nConsumers\nIn Kafka, like producing a message, we can also consume it. To consume it, consumers are used in Kafka. Consumers consume the records from the topic. They are based on the concept of a consumer-group, where some of the consumers are assigned in the group. The record which is published to the topic is only delivered to one instance of the consumer from one consumer-group. Kafka internally uses a mechanism of consuming records inside the consumer-group. Each instance of the consumer will get hold of the particular partition log, such that within a consumer-group, the records can be processed parallel by each consumer.\nConsumer-Group?\nConsumers can be organized into logic consumer groups. Consumer-Group is a group of consumers. Several Consumers form a group to share the work. Different consumer groups can share the same record or same consumer-group can share the work.\nZooKeeper\nAnd finally, let’s talk about Zookeeper. Zookeeper is used by Kafka to store metadata. Kafka is a distributed system and is built to use Zookeeper.\nIt is basically used to maintain coordination between different nodes in a cluster. One of the most important things for Kafka is it uses zookeeper to periodically commit offsets so that in case of node failure it can resume from the previously committed offset.\nZookeeper also plays a vital role for serving many other purposes, such as leader detection, configuration management, synchronization, detecting when a new node joins or leaves the cluster, etc.\nFuture Kafka releases are planning to remove the zookeeper dependency but as of now it is an integral part of it.\n\n\nTopic partitions are assigned to balance the assignments among all consumers in the group. Within a consumer group, all consumers work in a load-balanced mode; in other words, each message will be seen by one consumer in the group. If a consumer goes away, the partition is assigned to another consumer in the group. This is referred to as a rebalance. If there are more consumers in a group than partitions, some consumers will be idle. If there are fewer consumers in a group than partitions, some consumers will consume messages from more than one partition.\nAbout consumer groups, In order to avoid two consumer instances within the same consumer groups reading the same record twice, each partition is tied to only one consumer process per consumer group.\n\n\nNow, let’s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of Kafka. And why and when we should use Kafka.\nKafka is designed for holding and distributing large volumes of messages.\nFirst and most important feature of Kafka is scalability. Kafka scales nicely up to a hundred thousands (100,000) messages per seconds even on a single server. The opponents of Kafka are far behind about it.\nKafka has an essential feature to provide resistance to node/machine failure within the cluster.\nKafka is Highly durable messaging system. Kafka offers the replication feature, which makes data or messages to persist more on the cluster over a disk. This makes it durable.\nKafka is a durable message store and clients can get a “replay” of the event stream on demand, as opposed to more traditional message brokers where once a message has been delivered, it is removed from the queue.\nKafka has a retention period, so it will store your records for the time or size you specify and can be set by topic.\n\n\nCons:\nNow, Let’s talk about the drawbacks of Kafka.\nFirst of all, we should say that to use it is not easy according to opponents. Because Kafka has some complexity about configurations.\nSecondly, Apache Kafka does not contain a complete set of monitoring as well as managing tools. Thus, new startups or enterprises fear to work with Kafka.\nThirdly, it depends on Apache Zookeeper. But in the development roadmap, the kafka team aims to escape from Zookeeper.\nKafka messaging system works like that queue but it does not support priority queue like RabbitMQ.\nIn general, there are no issues with the individual message size. However, the brokers and consumers start compressing these messages as the size increases. Due to this, when decompressed, the node memory gets slowly used. Also, compress happens when the data flow in the pipeline. It affects throughput and also performance.\nKafka has a very simple routing approach. Publish messages to the topic then subscribe to it and receive messages. On the other hand, other messaging systems like RabbitMQ have better options if you need to route your messages in complex ways to your consumers such as fanout routing or conditional routing.",

      "description": "REQUIREMENTS\nThis course will be of great benefit regardless of your familiarity with Ionic, Angular, and/or Firebase. It's designed in such a way that linearity is not necessary: helpful if you are new, but if you know what you're looking for it's quick easy to find. This is fact how true learning happens: through non-linear, creative engagement with information.\nThe only thing prerequisite on your part is familiarity with Javascript and/or web development, and genuine curiosity. Everything else will fall into place.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTHE FRAMEWORKS\nThe framework releases used in this course span across Ionic 4 and 5, and Angular 8 and 9. All code in the repo has since been updated to the latest releases and tested.  More information can be found at the GitHub repo.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSOURCE CODE\nAll code from this course can be found at the GitHub monorepo (didaktio/Ionic-Angular-Course). The monorepo is broken down into submodules, which are independant repositories also locatable on the didaktio GitHub profile. Attached to every video (in Resources) is a link to the specific repo containing the code used in that video. Each repo has a README which you can follow to run the code locally, but most likely you'll just use them for reference.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nABOUT THIS COURSE\nThis is a fast-paced, information-dense and future-proof course intended to get you flying solo as soon as possible. Unlike many other such courses, little time is given to theory about the technologies and languages used. What matters is their capabilities and potential as relevant to your needs. This course is about that. This course is making these powerful technologies do what you want. That isn't learned from documentation. It is learned through problem-oriented doing.\nIn this course you will pick up 90% of the important principles underlying Ionic and Angular by focusing on specific and common problems like: login, user registration, role-based capabilities, blocking particular URLs, storing and manipulating data, notifications, sending emails, and more. Every line of code in this course was written on a live development server, so most videos finish with the result live in the browser.\nThe course is as anti-academic as you can get. We'll work through solutions together, often line-by-line, thinking in real-time. This means we'll encounter errors, figure out alternatives on-the-fly, and that things will be uncompromisingly changed when necessary.\nThe guiding philosophy is Just-in-Time Learning. Like every subject-area in the world, advancement in understanding is amplified 100-fold when the information being provided maps onto a local problem — in other words, we learn much faster when working with problems that we understand AND that are interesting. Absent well-defined problems, learning never really happens; theory only sticks when you're familiar with the subject area.\nAgain, this is a practical course. Only take it if you're serious about learning how to develop applications and build websites with Ionic and/or Angular.\nAmongst the learnings on offer:\nThe fundamentals of the LATEST Ionic and Angular releases + TypeScript, Node, Google Cloud, RXJS, and more\nUser Login and Signup (multiple methods)\nPopovers, Modals, Alerts\nNotifications, automatic emails, text message logic (and all common background task needs)\nHow to deploy an app/website to the web using Kubernetes and/or Firebase Hosting\nStoring data on device for user detection (like how most websites know it's you even when you're logged out)\nHow to stream, convert, transform and present live, complex data as good as Netflix (RXJS)\nAngular Modules, Components, Pipes, Attributes, Directives (ngFor, ngIf, ng-container, ng-template etc)\nBuilding a fine-grained theme controller\nIonic Pages, UI Components, CLI\nRole-Specific capabilities: routes, data-viewing and entirely different UI's  for different types of users (eg admin vs customer)\nLifecycles\nForms: Simple and advanced, validation, error-handling and pre-population\nServices, reusable utilities, global features\nInterpolation, DOM Sanitisation\nCAPTCHA forms and the 'Are You a Robot?' test\nCustom scripts\nBuild and publish a Progressive Web Application (PWA)\nFirebase: Firestore Documents, Collections, Permissions\nCloud Storage: uploading and accessing images and other media types\nCloud Functions: running secure backend processes, scheduling, fine-grained control over your app\nDesigning for all device screen sizes using Ionic Grid and other SCSS tricks\nand much, much more.\nThe videos are fast-paced, dense, and sometimes unforgiving. Where necessary, they're slowed down —but practical people with work to do(!) want and need information that can be employed immediately. Hopefully every single video delivers on this measure. It certainly does sound-wise: every minute is backgrounded by brainwave-enhancing, epiphany-inducing sounds from the brilliant Steve Reich.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nGOING THROUGH THE COURSE\nThe Basics section of this course is where to go if you're stuck with or unsure about some of the core concepts (directives, interpolation, forms, data presentation, services etc). It one of the latter modules by design — because your first foray into any domain should be to get a feel for it. You likely already have knowledge of the basics: realistic, tangible (and personal) problems are how we weave independent and fragmentary threads of knowledge into something deep and functional. Starting with theory before practice is at minimum going to slow down learning rate, and is typically the most reliable and quickest way to become disinterested and eventually turned off.\nThere is no Right Way to Learn. There is the way that works for you. The course is as loosely structured as it can be without sacrificing on quality. In other words, the naming needs to be informative but not --verbose, the sectioning needs to have a purpose, and each video must be lean and to the point but also able to stand on its own. The Just-in-Time Learning philosophy must only be deviated from when necessary; videos should first and foremost be practical, concise, and time well spent.\nWith all that in mind, what follows is a few pointers for navigating your way up Mount Everest. They're not all incompatible; use those that appeal to you, experiment, iterate, throw others in the trash. The critical thing to know is: formalities and structure and tyrannical rules about sequence are usually bad things, and freedom to explore and follow interest are good. This isn't school. This is you taking control over your own learning. And yes, it can — and should! — be fun. To the tips:\nWatch the Outro before you start.\nMove laterally. For example, you might do the Basics section first and then jump to the intro, and then the RXJS section, and then the Badass Todo App (thetodoapp[dot]com).\nDo the Basics section first if you're unfamiliar with Angular.\nCriticise. Have the confidence to change things, improve the code, structure the code in your preferred manner.\nView everything through a practically-oriented lens. Watch videos wearing your technique-coloured glasses, not those lawyer-esque analysis spectacles.\nUse tools(!) — those recommended in the course and those you discover yourself. The heuristic here is simple: if it lets you get on with working on the most important stuff (the HARD problem solving, the stuff that requires true creativity), then it's worth it. All other benefits — it saves time, increases readability, better security etc — are secondary.\nSpeed up videos. Slow down videos. Install Video Speed Controller on your browser to enable easier jumping through and speed manipulation of the tutorials.\nUse the supporting materials where possible (download the files, visit the links).\nPeruse the GitHub repository when one exists.\nPost questions.\nCombine this course with other courses and brilliant bodies of work (Fireship on YouTube, Angular in Depth, The Net Ninja on Youtube...)\nUse The Problem of Concern as your North Star.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nWRITING CODE\nPrioritise techniques and concepts over formalities.\n\n\nUse Stack Overflow and the relevant GitHub Issues pages for errors and/or optimisations.\n\n\nKnow that things will constantly evolve, which means you shouldn't lock yourself in from the first day. This means being liberal with typings (use any and unknown quite a lot early on), and worrying about structure and clean imports and other formalities when things are working. The heuristic here is: let small fires burn. Small fires rid the woodlands of flammable materials, thereby minimising the chances of one big, catastrophic fire. This applies to pretty much all aspects of life, but is starkly manifest in programming.\n\n\nWhen building for users, how you do things under the hood should be extremely conservative relative to the UX. This is most apparent with form input, where users should be able to enter typos and other different representations of the same data without any fuss. Under the hood, all data is converted and normalised into a standard form. For example with dates, you might let the user enter a date or use a datepicker. This means two different types of data. Combine this with the usual complication accompanying date manipulation (dealing with timezones, incorrect dates, offsets, readability, unix vs iso etc), and you've got the ultimate recipe for a migraine. A far-reaching decision to make early on might be to deal only with ISO strings in the backend, meaning you convert EVERY single date into an ISO. If the datepicker gives you a date object, you convert it to an ISO. If the user enters something like (10.12.2019), you convert it to an ISO. This ISO is how you store the information backend. Displaying it frontend then becomes a doddle: another conversion into the preferred format, and some interpolation — simple. This method works because ISO strings, like unix and javascript timestamps, are the same for everybody.\n\n\nDon't worry about testing. Worry about writing tight code that runs as expected - then publish.\n\n\nThe less code the better. Condensed, concise code has more to it than beauty: by demanding true understanding, it protects against the illusion that information consumption equals knowledge. It doesn't. I can read one thousand lines of code and, thinking that the time invested and length of information absorbed is impressive enough, be satisfied with my grasping. But later on I end up coming back to that code repeatedly and making a ton of other errors because actually, I don't understand. Alternatively, I could breakdown (and even improve upon) that one line of code which resembles a spacetime equation, and not leave until I actually understand. And if I cannot understand, at least I don't have the illusion that I do. Finally, condensed code far better facilitates principles of modularity, flexibility, changeability, and debuggability.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFUTUREPROOF-ABILITY AND MOVING FORWARD\nThis is a future-proof course. Just like any real-world project or company or system, the course and its supporting resources (links, the GitHub Repo) will be continuously updated — errors and incompatibilities addressed, dependencies updated, and additional content added as requested or necessary. The course uses a combination of Angular 8 and 9, node 10 and 12, and Ionic 4 and 5.

We'll start with CSS basics, looking at the CSS Box Model, CSS Priorities and the structure of the CSS language.  We'll then move onto more advanced skills such and create fully responsive website layouts and even build a page with cool visual Parallax effects to give it a real sense of depth.\nFinally, we'll put everything together in a 2 hour real-world project.  Here, we'll build one of the website templates that ships with the course, but we'll do it together, section by section form the ground up.  You'll get to code along with me to build your very own professional looking website, from scratch.\nAnd that's it!  Everything you need to know about HTML and CSS in less than 20 hours.\n\n\nThis course includes:\nNearly 20 hours of high quality videos\nDownloadable code examples, support files and lecture slides\n10 professional website templates\nTechnical support via the Questions and Answers section from real software developers\n\n\nWho is this course designed for:\nComplete beginners with zero experience\nJunior developers with some knowledge who wish to level up their skills\nAdvanced web developers who would like to brush up on their skills\nAnyone who wants to learn how to create professional websites using just HTML and CSS\nAnyone who would like 10 professional website templates to pull apart and rebuild as much as they'd like and use even for commercial projects.\nEnjoy the course ;)",

      "description": "Hi guys,\n\n\nIn this course, we will talk about the architecture of our project.\n\n\nIn this course, we will create a project like product-ordering-application.\nWhen we say product-ordering-application, we can think of it like that we will have a product-list page such as book-list, food-list or dress-list. Somehow users or customers will see these product-lists and they can buy one of the products. Of course, at the end of it, this transaction will be logged.\nActually, in our application, we will try to implement these processes with different microservices.\n\n\nTo implement this application, we will use three different microservices.\nOur microservices will be api-gateway, product-service and transaction-service.\n\n\nIn api-gateway, we will manage APIs. This microservice will be a gateway for the whole application. To access the other services, we will use this microservice. In this microservice, we will handle user-management also. We will authorize users and if the users are authorized, other services can be available.\n\n\nIn product-service, we will manage product CRUD operations. This service will be a product-management-service.\n\n\nIn transaction-service, we will manage transaction CRUD operations. This service will store the logs coming from the product purchases. For example, the UserX bought the ProductX on DateX etc.\n\n\nOur microservices dependency process will be like that. First of all, the client can access the api-gateway. To access the api-gateway, the client should pass the login process. Then other services will be accessible over the api-gateway.\n\n\nSpring-security will be one of the main topics in our application. Also, we will use JWT to provide security.\nHere, the important point is, we will also use secure connections among microservices. To provide it, we will use secure-key-tokens.\n\n\nAs a database, we will use PostgreSQL and H2Database. We can use other databases also but at the end of it we will deploy our codes to Heroku. These databases can be used on Heroku freely so we chose these databases.\n\n\nWe will provide connection between microservices with Retrofit library. Retrofit will handle all our networking issues.\n\n\nFor our all services, we will create cloud deployment with Heroku. Heroku is an amazing free framework. We can deploy our spring-boot projects with some configuration over github easily. So At the end of the course, we will have an application on production and we will have a code on github that is accessible by everyone.\n\n\nIn addition to these libraries, In our project, we will use lots of technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Gradle, Lombok, Heroku etc.\n\n\nOf course here, our main library will be Spring-boot. It will provide a simpler and faster way to set up, configure and database to provide data.\n\n\nAt the end of each microservices, we will test our applications with Postman. Postman is another amazing tool to debug networking.\n\n\nThat's all about the microservices architecture of our project.\nThank you.",

      "description": "There are over 18 million software developers in the world… so why does everyone have a difficult time finding an affordable, capable developer?\nIt's simple… most people don't know how to properly hire a remote developer, something that is easy to achieve when you know where and how to look.\nBy hiring remote developers, you can instantly lower your operational costs by 50-60% while speeding up project completion times and freeing up your time to focus on building/growing your business.\nI know this first hand from having spent the past 15 years as a developer coding countless websites and managing all types of programmers both in person and remotely. Most importantly, I'm a big believer in the power of a remote workforce; I think it's a huge equalizer that can give regular businesses the power to really compete with the big guys, while spreading around great job opportunities.\nThrough my experience, I've learned exactly what to look for in a remote developer, how to screen and interview candidates, how to write an effective job post and most importantly, how to get the right people working on my projects for the right price.\nThis course was created to you teach step-by-step everything you need to do in order to hire a high-quality, low cost remote developer within a few days or less.\nMore specifically, I'm going to teach you how to:\nWrite an effective job description\nHave developers reaching out to you to work on your projects\nFilter out the bad applications, and choose a handful of good candidates quickly\nThe difference between passive and active hiring\nWhat to look for in a remote developer (that most people don't know)\nA trick for your job description that'll help you pre-screen applications quickly\nHow to weed out bad candidates, and target in on good talent\nAdditional, I'm going to give you:\nReference slides on different types of developers you might hire\nA pre-written job post template, with placeholders you can tailor to your specific project needs\nSample variations on this template for different types of developer jobs\nA list of sample screening questions\nCheat sheets for all the important parts of this course, for easy reference\nAND you'll have access to all the information in this course for life in addition to the extra material that will be released to the course members over the coming months.\nThe sooner you try this approach, the sooner I guarantee you'll stop wasting time, effort, energy and money and instead, you'll start achieving your goals and living your dreams.\nREMINDER: This is a risk free purchase with Udemy's 30 day money back guarantee. Just imagine what your business would be like if within 30 days if you had access to the developer of your dreams with a few simple clicks.\nBest,\nMike Cavaliere\nP.S.

Enrolling in this course will get you over ten hours of video that is easy to follow so that you can practice all that you learn, as you progress. Learn Front-End Web Development from Scratch will teach you everything you need to know to get up and running developing front end web pages. You will begin by exploring and mastering HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML is often referred to as the building blocks of the internet. It offers web pages better structure. Once you have got a solid grasp on structure, you will move onto aesthetics and how you can make your sites look great. Learning to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful way to achieve fantastic looking pages that are highly customisable. After you understand HTML and CSS, the next logical step is to learn a front-end framework, and the most popular and modern front-end framework is Bootstrap. It offers quick and easy methods for adding aesthetic features and functionality by using pre-written CSS and JavaScript - all you need to do is include the class in your HTML.\nIt is my hope that you will find this course to be an excellent introduction into the world of web development, and that you will not just learn something new, but that you will have fun as you do.",

      "description": "** LODASH 4 - LEARN and MASTER ALL 300+ FUNCTIONS! **\nWhy is this course for you?\nThis course is the most complete course on Lodash.JS with over 11 hours of video content! And probably the most complete course about Lodash available anywhere! Lodash is a huge library, and so is this course!\nThis course will teach you all you need to do to become a master with Lodash.JS, one of the most popular Javascript libraries on the web. It will provide an example of every available function in Lodash, that's over 300+ examples!, in a step by step, function by function method.\nThis course will start at the most basic functions all the way up to the more complex functions. At regular intervals, there will be a Knowledge Check quiz for you to check your knowledge of each of the functions that you have learnt to far. At the end of the course there is a timed Practice Test, so you can test yourself in near exam conditions to really put your knowledge to the test!\nI've spent days creating this course for you, and hours researching examples. There are not many examples on Lodash.JS out there, so I've put in all the effort so that you don't need to!\nIt's a one time investment. The course will be updated with more examples and lectures over time!\nHow is this course different?\nOther Lodash courses on Udemy claim to be \"comprehensive\" or \"complete\", but ask yourself, how can they be complete when the course only covers a few functions and is just a couple of hours long? Only this course, Lodash 4 - The Master Guide, will do justice to the whole of the Lodash library by providing examples of ALL 300+ functions. This huge course is over 11 hours long! This course also covers Lodash 4, the up-to-date, latest version of Lodash. Other courses use an old, out of date version of Lodash.\nNote that by \"comprehensive\" I will provide at least one example on every function. Some functions have more than one example. However, it's impossible to provide an example on every single use case of a function as I'm sure you'll appreciate, as the Lodash is a vast library. The student is expected to research further on some functions.\nNB This course contains all the material in my Lodash 4 - The Beginner's Guide course PLUS 6 hours extra content\nThis course has been built in a modular way, so you can either learn the functions one by one, or just the ones that you wish to learn more about. You can still become an expert in Lodash, even by following a few modules.\nBy the end of the course, you will become very sufficient with using Lodash. Don't forget, if you are not entirely happy with the course, you have the 30 day Money-Back-Guarantee.\nUse this course in several ways:\nReference Guide - if you need help on a particular function and need an example and explanation how to use it. Just jump straight to the relevant video.\nRevision Guide - if you want to test your knowledge of Lodash, have an school assignment, and need to check your understanding - use the Knowledge Check quizzes and Practice Tests\nKnowledge Builder - learn module by module, following each example and then trying it out for yourself, building up your confidence and knowledge\nCourse Modules\nIntroduction\nManipulating Strings in Lodash\nManipulating Arrays in Lodash\nManipulating Collections in Lodash\nMath & Number Functions in Lodash\nLanguage Functions in Lodash\nUtils & Date Functions in Lodash\nManipulating Functions in Lodash\nSequencing and Chaining in Lodash\nJust a small selection of some of the things you will learn in this jam-packed course\nArray and object transformations\nGrouping and sorting\nComposing functions\nWorking with string and arrays\nTemplate\nCloning and assigning properties\nWorking with objects\nMapKeys, MapValues, Assign, Extend\nChecking the types\nDebounce, Throttle, Memorize, Unary\nCurrying, Partial, Wrap, Bind,Flow\nExtending lodash with own functions Mixin\nSequencing\nImplict and Explicit Chaining\nFunctional programming (intro) with unwrapping\nAnd much more...\nWhat's Included in this Course Package?\nUp-to-date HD-Quality videos with the latest version of Lodash 4\nAn example and explanation of all 300+ Lodash functions!\nFree support in the Q&A\nKnowledge Checks at regular intervals for you to check your knowledge\nPractice Tests at the end of the course to verify your understanding of Lodash\nThis course is for you if...\nYou are a Javascript developer looking to learn how to use Lodash in your everyday coding\nYou already know about Lodash but struggling to understand some of the more complex functions\nYou want to test your existing knowledge of Lodash\nYou want to gain another skill for your Resume or CV\nIf you're serious about becoming an expert at Lodash, then start your journey and master Lodash with this course!",

You may also want to change your sites web server, from, for example, Apache to nginx or LiteSpeed.\nMigrating a WordPress site can be time-consuming, but it's an essential process and skill that every WordPress site owner should have.\nThe curriculum of the course includes the process of moving a WordPress site from a local development environment to a server as well as from one server to another. Each of these scenarios presents its own set of distinct challenges.\nWe'll cover the following migration scenarios in the course:\nMigrate your site from a local development environment to an Apache or LiteSpeed server.\nMigrate your site from a local development environment to a nginx server.\nMigrate your site from a \"live\" production server to a another \"live\" production server, where Apache or LiteSpeed is the web server being used on both production servers.\nMigrate your site from a \"live\" production server to a another \"live\" production server, where nginx is the web server being used on both production servers.\nMigrate your site from a \"live\" production server to a another \"live\" production server, where Apache or LiteSpeed is the web server being used on the source production server and nginx is the web server being used on the destination production servers.\nMigrate your site from a \"live\" production server to a another \"live\" production server, where nginx is the web server being used on both production servers.\nMigrate a WordPress site from a domain site to a sub domain site on the same server. This type of migration can be called a testbed or staging migration and is very important, as it allows you to test custom code, new features or updates prior to implementing the code, features or updates on your production site. It will allow you to first test any changes will save you time, money and reduce the stress of worrying if an update, code change or feature might crash your site.\nAn important and often overlooked aspect of site migration is the SSL certificate for the site. Due to the HTTP Strict Transport Security header, downtime is guaranteed when you migrate a site, as returning visitors will not be able to access your site until you have reinstalled and configured the SSL certificates.\nAs this course is all about a seamless, quick, easy, plugin free and ZERO DOWNTIME migration process, SSL certificate migration is also included in the course. You will learn how to migrate a WordPress site and the SSL certificate from a production server to another.\nEnroll today to become a WordPress migration professional and experience the advantages of plugin-free, zero-downtime WordPress migration.",

Instructor appears to be very knowledgeable about subject.\nDennis Ferraro\nAlthough I could clearly see my lack of skill in php and css I was able to understand enough to execute the new information, given the platforms. The course delivered what it said it would.\nTimothy Dykes\nThe course was to-the-point without a bunch of rambling on about irrelevant and unrelated things. It was easy to follow along with the creation of the form from start to finish in all of the languages necessary (except the styles, maybe). The finished form is also available as a .zip so that you can explore the source code yourself if there is something you had trouble following in the video.\nFollowing the lectures will let you practice step by step the development process. During the course you will understand how to set your page, create an HTML form, stylize it with CSS and later process it with PHP. In the course you will find practical lecture on adding additional protection against Spam bot submission attacks. You will also gain solid understanding on the whole development process.\nAt first, we will overview on what you will be creating during the course, then will structure the initial files and start building the form. Next we add our PHP code to process the information received from the contact form and validate the submitted data with the help of PHP. We will conclude by adding various protection methods against unwanted Spam bots.\nUpdate 2021: Completely updated and rewritten course content!\n\nPlease enjoy the course !",

      "description": "Flask is a flexible web framework written in Python. It's narrow in scope so that means it's much easier to learn.\nA web application with Flask can be as simple as 1 function with 4 total lines of code. Regardless of your technical background, what I want that to signal to you is that Flask can be very very small in scope which means a much smaller learning curve.\nOf course, you can add all kinds of technology (such as a SQL database), to make Flask even more functional but that's completely optional.\nHere's a few use cases of flask:\nQuick and fast RESTful API service\nMicroservice for offloading tasks from a main app (such as a Django app) to handle all sorts of processing (creating thumbnails, running machine learning, doing web scraping, sending notifications, calculating bills and invoices, and so on)\nFull fledged Web Application (user login, data storage, user sharing, etc)\nIntegrating into an iot device to control sensors, motors, servos, mics, cameras, and so on.\nAs middleman between services like Shopify and Zapier. (Ie you need to analyze some customer data from Shopify before it becomes a zap?)\nAnything you can image\nFlask, as with many Python Package, can almost do anything you can image. And there's a good chance that someone has already created a package to help your project's development time increase in a big way.\n\n\nDjango vs Flask\nThese two are compared all the time. At their core, they attempt to accomplish the same thing: web application development. But they do it in very different ways.\n\n\nFirst off, remember that Python is flexible so Django and Flask are flexible.\n\n\nFlask can be more flexible but increases development time on larger projects\nDjango cuts long term development time on larger projects\nFlask is smaller as in file size\nDjango is bigger but has many security features built in (such as CSRF and clickjacking)\nDjango has an ORM\nFlask can easily be integrated into SQLAlchemy\nIf you know Flask, learning Django will be easier and vice versa. In fact, once you know any python web framework it's much easier to learn others so you can find the best library that your project needs.\n\n\nAre you ready to begin?\n\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nJustin",

It is easy to learn, open source, customizable, and coupled with an incredible support from the community; in short it is truly worth your time! This course walks you through the fascinating arena of web development, giving you a grid-based framework that’s easy to work on and saves the time that goes into CSS framework development.\nYou will see how to create a “PACKT CMS’ application, which will have a custom CMS layout with amazing real-time features. This will enable PACKT to create new courses, and users to view all the data in an advanced table format and get a dashboard overview of all the courses, views, subscriptions, and so on.\nWe'll start with a dedicated video that explains the intricacies of the different components in our application, including hacks and gotchas to master bootstrap code. We will spice up our application by using Bootstrap JavaScript plugins such as modals, tooltips, popovers, alerts, and tabs. We will also use third-party JavaScript plugins for various elements you’ll be relying on day to day.\nYou'll find out how to migrate your existing application to Bootstrap 4 seamlessly. You'll add the newly introduced components from Bootstrap 4 in your current application and see what’s changed from Bootstrap 3. This course takes you from zero to hero, leaving you with the know-how required to build your own real-world project.\nAbout The Author\nVedran Cindrić has been a front-end developer for around 15 years now and has been using Bootstrap exclusively for the last 4 years. He has run a web development company called Flip.hr for 5 years now, and he has worked on a lot of interesting projects for clients all around the world. He really enjoys writing great code, optimizing websites, and creating awesome responsive experiences. He has written some articles on Bootstrap before, but this is his first time creating a video course.\nI’d like to thank a really special girl called Tea for buying me a better microphone and making sure I actually recorded the videos.",

FastAPI is based on Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize, and deserialize data, and automatically auto-generate OpenAPI documents. It fully supports asynchronous programming and can run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.\n\n\nWhat is Amazon RDS\nAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a distributed relational database service by Amazon Web Services. It is a web service running \"in the cloud\" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications.\n\n\nWhat is Elastic Beanstalk\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which orchestrates various AWS services, including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service, CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers.\n\nThis course is divided on to different sections\n\n\n1: In the first section we will have a simple introduction to FastAPI and also we are going to learn about installation process\n2: In the second section we are going to learn about fundamental concepts of FastAPI, also in this section we integrate amazon RDS (Relations Database Service ) with FastAPI,  at the end we deploy our Python REST API to Heroku.\n3: In the third section we are going to learn about building asynchronous API's with Python and FastAPI, we will talk about user system, authorization, API router and token authentication, at the end we deploy our project to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, after that we buy a domain name from Amazon Route53 and we add our custom domain in the Python REST API, at the end we request SSL  Certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager and we secure our Python REST API.\n4: in the last section we talk about Tortoise ORM (Object Relational Mapper ) and we create some examples",

You design each of your APIs around a contract written in an API description language like OpenAPI for consistency, reusability, and broad interoperability. Starting with an API contract allows you to better plan the design of your API and get feedback from stakeholders before writing any code.\n\n\nMany APIs in use today have been around for more than two decades, but only in recent years have companies begun exploring and adopting the concept of API-first.\n\n\nThe Benefits of an API-first developmentApproach\nAn API-first approach to building products provides many benefits, including but not limited to:\n\n\nDevelopment teams can work in parallel\nReduces the cost of developing apps\nIncreases the speed to market\nEnsures good developer experiences\nReduces the risk of failure\n\n\nAPIs as First-Class Citizens\nAn API-first approach to building products can benefit your organization in many ways.

Along the way, you’ll see how to make your site responsive, reusable, and easy to maintain — skills that transfer to any React project.\nYou’ll also get hands-on with Tailwind CSS to create clean, modern designs without writing endless lines of custom CSS. I’ll share practical tips for keeping your code organized, solving common bugs, and making your app look great on any device or screen size.\nFinally, we’ll take things live by deploying the site with Vercel, so your project is available online for anyone to see and share.\nThis course is perfect if you want to level up your React skills, get more confident with Tailwind CSS, and build a professional project that feels like a real-world banking app.",

      "description": "When I first started building a Shopify App in June 2020. I started looking online for a good example of a Shopper-Facing App that sits on a subpath of a Shopify-Powered Site. The best solution I found after combing through Shopify's Documentation was a Proxy App.\nBut, I couldn't find a good example of a Shopify Repo that implemented it well.\nIn this course, we cover how to Build a Full-Stack Shopify App with NodeJS, MongoDB, and a whole lot of JavaScript.\nAnd there's tons of working code along the way to help you get started building your Dream Shopify App.\n\n\nThe course is based on 2 large Github repositories:\nRepo #1: Build a Shopify App with Node and React\nThis is the Demo Repo by Shopify's Documentation Team itself.\nThe good news is that Shopify has already created a multi-part tutorial on their NextJS, GraphQL, Apollo Repo, which covers:\nIntroduction\nSet up your app\nEmbed your app in Shopify\nBuild your user interface with Polaris\nLearn the GraphQL Admin API\nFetch data with Apollo\nCharge a fee using the Billing API\nListen for store events with webhooks\n\n\nRepo #2: The Live Social King Repo\nThe Social King Repo (the main attraction of this course) is actually built on top of Shopify's Demo NextJS Repo (mentioned above).\nSocial King is a very large, modular, and 'easy-to-reason-about-&-extend'  repo with over 1,400 commits already.\nIt includes, amongst many other features:\n1) Multi-Lingual Translation\n2) Custom CSS Editor within the Shopify Admin App - that CSS gets injected into every view within the Shopper-Facing App\n3) Billing API - free trial for x days + then a recurring monthly fee.\n\n\nSocial King's Shopper Facing App vs. The Competitor's Implementation\nIf you install Social King on a client's site or development store, you'll notice a large difference in User Experience Between Social King + Competitors.\nThe main difference being:\n\n\nSocial King's Localization Features Out-Of-The-Box\nThe bottom line is that Shopify Supports merchants from all over the world - not just English-Speaking audiences - meaning, using Social King as boilerplate code, will allow your Dream App to:\nSupport the native language of your merchant's buyers. This could be the difference between whether merchants that install your app stick around past the free trial or uninstall the app\nGain More opportunities for low-cost foreign keywords on the Shopify App Store's keyword-bidding system\n\n\n\nSocial King's Built-In CSS Editor for Store Admins Out-Of-The-Box\nThe Demo Shopify App also doesn't include the Custom CSS Editor built into the Store Admin App - this is a crucial feature because it's one of the main features that drives reviews on the App Store *(Social King is getting reviews faster than the incumbent players)!\nWhen Your Dream App Goes Live & Customers write in asking for CSS/Styling Tweaks, all you have to do is edit the CSS Saved within the Database for that Given Shop. It's very modular & a quick win & crucial feature for quickly adding value & awesome service to merchants.\n\n\nBattle-Tested Shopify App Code\nIn Short: Social King has been live & Serving Customers for almost a year now. Customers have been writing in asking for New Features & CSS Tweaks. I've also asked myself questions like: \"what are the low-hanging fruit here? Which features can we build out which will provide the biggest return on time?\"\n\n\nSPA vs. Sending The Views back as Liquid Strings\nWhen I first started Coding out Social King, I naturally tried to use a Single-Page Application Framework/Library like: ReactJS, VueJS & Angular.\nBut, there was one key flaw - using any of these frameworks out-of-the-box would result in the Shopify Store's Existing CSS, Header & Footer, and any other Plugins getting lost in translation.\nThere are still many Shopify App's that Sacrifice the Given Shop's Theme & Apps for the code cleanliness of an SPA.\nIn this course, we switch it up for the delight and benefit of the customer.\nEvery Shopify Store that installs your app will have its own unique theme & styling. Meaning sometimes, the elements on the Community Pages (Shopper-Facing) will actually inherit the CSS from the parent.\n\n\nIsn't Shopify's Demo App Repo Already Good Enough?!\nThe Social King Demo Repo attempts to fill in the Gaps Left by Shopify's Documentation & Demo Repo.\nThe Official Shopify Open-Source repo and tutorial is a good start, but:\nIt doesn't contain some of the basic features that you'll need for building out a successful multi-page shopper-facing app.\nIt doesn't include image uploads on the shopper and admin apps.\n\nIt doesn't include multi-lingual support - ie a method for building the app once, and then translating the text via Google Translate, and enabling the Store Admin to provide internationalized experiences.\n\n\nBenefits of Rendering Liquid Views Server Side with NodeJS\nThe NodeJS Proxy Server, has a middleware function that looks something like this:\n// Send everything from this route back as liquid.\nrouter.use((req, res, next) => {\nres.set('Content-Type', 'application/liquid');\nreturn next();\n});\nThe Benefits are:\na) Every store maintains its header & footer\nb) Other Shopify Apps can supplement your Shopper-Facing App's Functionality.\n\n\n\"But, I need to Use React....\"?~\nActually, on my Github, you can find a React-Powered Shopify App. Feel free to reach out if you can't find it.\n\n\nIf Social King is So Awesome, Like You Say, Then Why Is It Open-Source?\nPaying It Forward: the internet is a very crowded place. I've been consuming free content on YouTube and low-cost, high-value content on Udemy for a while now. I know how good it feels when I find the exact course on Udemy which solves my problem, & saves me weeks, or even months of time. Part of living a life filled with gratitude is reciprocating for the kindness and good things that have been given to you.\n\nThe internet is about giving people stuff for free or at a very low cost.\n\nThere's a Social Mission Here: lots of these merchants got completely wiped out by COVID. So, Covid was a wake-up call to these merchants across the world, saying \"let's go online & let's learn how to succeed online.\"\n\n\nShopify is one of the easiest ways for merchants to open online sales channels at a low-cost and low time investment.\n\nSo, I happen to think that at this time, 2021, developers that want to be part of the eCommerce Space have so much opportunity that it's what's known in business as a: \"Blue Ocean\" (the opposite of a Red Ocean, where competitors eat each other alive due to overcrowdedness).\n\nMeaning, there are enough opportunities within this space where I can be successful, while also helping the ecosystem be successful.\nAnd you really feel that on the Shopify App Store - because it's a new market. If you actually ship a product that adds value for these stores, they'll reciprocate with reviews & monthly subscriptions that will hopefully make you successful as well.\n\n\nIt's very much like a new ecological ecosystem - where the success of the developers is very much interlinked with the success of the merchants. So adding value for both of those audiences makes sense in order to build new relationships within this space.\n\n\n\nEven More About Social King\nEver wish that your Shopify Store would support Guest Blogging?! With Social King, it finally does :)\nLet Shoppers Handle Content\nEnable shoppers to create content about your products. Moderate every post, content, image or video shared by your community.\nKeep The Community Branded\nYour Social Pages Integrate out-of-the-box with your existing Theme and Shopify Apps. Enable Email Notifications to bring shoppers back.\nScale Your Community\nShoppers are used to using Emojis on their Favorite Social Networks. Enable Emojis on your own Social Network, and Scale Your Community.\nShoppers Can:\nCreate their own user profile with a picture and about section\nCreate and edit posts, including uploading images and embedding videos\nComment on each other's posts\nReact with Emojis\nStore Admins Can:\nManage Tags to drive conversations around specific topics\nModerate every User-Generated Post & Comment before it goes live on the site\nPromote relevant products alongside user-generated content\nCustomize the look and feel of the community pages\nBoost Your Community Vibes\nProvide your customers with a platform to blog, connect, share, and learn all under the tent of your own brand.\nEmail Notifications\nWhen any post or comment is approved, the shopper gets an email notification with a link to the approved content - thereby bringing them back to your site (*for free!)\nMatches Your Theme & Integrates With Your Existing Apps\nWhen you install Social King, you'll notice that the Community Pages will have the exact same header and footer of your Original Theme - out of the box - and all your existing plugins should also work directly on your Community Pages.\nLooking To The Future\nIf you've got a Shopify App Idea & You Want a Repo to Save you Weeks, or even Months, then hopefully this little course will add value for you.\nGood Luck & May the Force Be With You ?",

The course is aimed at you, whether you are new or have already worked with GWT, and has as main objective to simplify GWT development, and to make  your GWT applications maintainable and future proof. The course presents both theory and practice material, and comes with fun quizzes to help you learn better.\nAbout myself: I am Full stack developer with over 8 years of experience working on various projects including GWT projects.  I have also contributed to GWT documentation.

      "description": "This is a good and effective course that can help you master React, and I can prove this:\nProof of quality:\nYou will understand React so well that you will know how to \"fool\" it by creating an error it cannot detect! Meanwhile, you will also be given a series of well-designed practices and challenges to practice and examine what you have learned.\n12 learning objectives:\nThis course comes with 12 learning objectives. Every learning objective is specific and measurable so that you can assess your learning outcomes on the spot. More importantly, all the learning objectives are within easy reach.\nYou will:\nBe able to fool React by creating an error React cannot detect.\nCreate a list for the query result of a NoSQL database, which is an array of an unknown number of irregular objects.\nControl list items in four ways: sorting the entire list, pinning an item to the top, changing item positions, and opening and closing sublists.\nCreate a list with an infinite number of sublists, where each sublist can be opened and closed independently.\nCreate 3 React gadgets to make you \"smarter\": clock, stopwatch, and countdown.\nSend a request to the backend API and display the response, including the waiting notice and error warning.\nFix the problem of “race condition/hazard” using closure.\nOperate nested components, including data exchange (props), efficiency (memo, lazy), user experience (transition), and convenience (context).\nUse Reducer to keep your components simple.\nUse Custom Hooks to better arrange and reuse your code.\nCreate entry and exit animations for list items.\nThe React Router\nBonus Section: The fun and creative application of \"reducer.\"\nWithin easy reach:\nThe goal is to keep this course short so that you can finish it quickly and see results sooner. This means every second is precious, so I have to make the most out of every second and only show you the most useful.\nBe considerate:\nAll demo codes are properly formatted so that related codes can be displayed on a single screen. You can pause the video when needed and analyze the codes at your own pace.\nKeep it light:\nYou will always be able to follow the course and make continuous progress. Here are the specific measures to keep this promise:\nIntroduce the new using the familiar, as you will see in lesson one.\nLearn the new by reusing and expanding the old.\nLearn the basics first and dig deeper later in the following practice/application session.\nFour original ideas:\nThis course comes with four original ideas, two general and two React-specific.\nThe Coconut Theory: If you haven't seen the problem, the solution to that problem can be difficult to understand. This is what makes coding difficult, especially for beginners. The solution is to focus on three basic factors: does it provide you space to write codes, does it give you access to needed resources, and does it execute your codes automatically at the right time? Believe it or not, all frameworks are designed to serve these three purposes. (See more details in Lesson 23.)\nThe Antonym Method: If you don't know how to solve a problem, try describing the problem using different words, especially antonyms. Doing so instantly gives you a different perspective, which helps you solve the problem. (See applications in Lesson 11 & 20.)\nThe \"Prep Area\": I refer to the area below the \"useState\" hook and above the template as the \"Prep Area.\" This is where we intercept state values and further process them, creating new values that better meet our demands. (See more details in Lesson 3.)\nThe Golden React Rule: To display something new, set a new state value! This rule gives you a clear instruction, enabling you to take the first step in the right direction right away! (See more details in Lesson 9.)",

All you need is a computer with an internet connection, at least to download the proper files at the beginning. You will get the most out of the course by reading the Laravel documentation, which goes into more details then I can go through in a video lecture due to time constraint.

You can also see the big picture and the small details.\nEffective automated tests are difficult to write. You need to practice a lot to be able to apply the principles and specific implementation steps to any project. Take the course and get the funds you need to continue practicing!\nMake your own Node.js package with test driven development using TypeScript tested with Jest. Through a real example, I will help you understand and learn how to build high quality modules for your projects that take advantage of TypeScript and have the least amount of bugs thanks to TDD.\nIn this course we will make a copy of a package from an application I made earlier. This means that you can learn the package creation method that I use on a daily basis through a code that represents true business value.\nAny questions you have, feel free to contact us, I will be happy to answer!",

Throughout the course, we will do 3 different projects to reinforce what we have learned.\nIn this course you will learn;\nHow to install and use Python, PyCharm\nFundamentals Django such as\n\n\nuser authentication\ntemplates, routes, and views\nadmin interface\nrobust security\nsupport for multiple database backends\nWe also will learn how to use AJAX in Django\nHow to deploy and run our production with Django\nAnd we use all of this to develop and design three different projects. These projects are: Task Manager, Blogs, and News\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nIf you don’t have experience with Python or you are totally new, we will start with the basics of Python. Before starting Django we will simply comprehend Python Package Managing ( PIP ) tools and virtual environments. Finally, we are going to start Django models, databases, URLs, views, migrations, authentication, cache, and so on.\nDjango is an interesting framework for developers because it provides the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact forms, and more. Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework that is already built so you can focus your time on developing your web app instead.\nWhat is Django?\nDjango is a Python-based Web Application Framework that follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. As one of the most popular Web Application Frameworks available today, Django has an extensive amount of documentation and extensions available. It is also built primarily for data-driven websites. A non-profit organization and an active community of developers contribute to Django’s platform, which is both open-source and free. The advantages of using Django are rapid development and less code. Django also provides an administrative interface and many bundled components. Websites such as The Washington Times, Instagram, and Nextdoor used Django for development, and employers frequently seek Django developers and Python specialists for web development.\nWhat is Django used for?\nAs an MVC Web Application Framework, many use Django to develop and deploy web applications rapidly. Django makes it easier for developers to hit the ground running rather than having to build the entirety of their platform from scratch. Mainly, Django is useful for those who are experts in Python — data models, settings, and files all use the Python language. In development since 2005, Django is a mature Web Application Framework with a significant amount of documentation and support, making its utilization attractive to those building complex, data-driven applications. Because Django is well-supported and robust, developers can use Django for large, enterprise-grade applications — but you can also use it for simpler applications.\nWho uses Django?\nPython programmers who are interested in low code development prefer Django for its “don’t repeat yourself” model. Ideally, Django can create streamlined programs that require little coding to initialize. It has a significant body of architecture within its components and libraries, and you can administer it internally. Developers primarily use Django for web applications that need to balance large amounts of data and significant loads. Over 2,500 packages are available to extend Django’s behavior, making it a particularly robust platform. Developers interested in using Django can check to see if the functionality they desire already exists. Django is also often favored by full-stack developers who want to be able to build web applications from start to finish, as you can use it for both frontend and backend design.\nIs Django frontend or backend?\nThe frontend design is related to what the user sees and interacts with. Backend is concerned primarily with the data. Django is both a frontend and backend Web Application Framework, unlike platforms like JavaScript’s Bootstrap, which you can use for frontend design. Django concerns itself primarily with the application’s interior workings, such as data manipulation, but is also useful for end-to-end frontend and backend design. A developer familiar with Django may be able to develop their web application “full-stack,” developing the entirety of the web application from front to back. However, frontend and backend work in Django can be separated if desired, meaning you can use Django for one or the other with some work. When separated in this way, Django is compatible with other frontend or backend technology.\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nWhat are the key considerations when deciding on a Web Application Framework?\nThere are both open-source, free Web Application Frameworks and commercial, proprietary frameworks. The latter is more expensive, but it will generally come with more support. Web Application Frameworks usually focus on a specific language. Django works with Python. Additionally, every Web Application Framework has its own level of complexity and learning curve, documentation, and support. Most web developers will want a Web Application Framework in a language they are fluent in. A solid library of extensions and plug-ins is also ideal as it reduces the amount of work the developer will need to do. Since the Web Application Framework has a lot to do with how a system functions, the system's look-and-feel may also come into play, as may other quality of life issues such as the robustness of the administrative panel.\nWhat is the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern?\nThe Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) is a type of software pattern for creating user interfaces. It standardizes how information flows through an application and makes it easier for developers to control all levels, from frontend to backend. Many Web Application Frameworks today follow the MVC model. Under the MVC architecture, the “model” refers to the data. The “view” refers to the display. Finally, the “controller” refers to the way that both models and views are updated. By retaining this consistency, multiple developers can also work together (both frontend and backend) without potentially retreading ground or overwriting essential items. The MVC model makes it easier to manage interconnected elements while ensuring that the application functions as a whole. MVC is compatible with desktop, mobile, and web application designs.\nWhat careers use Django?\nAs a Python-based web framework, Django is primarily used by web developers. Because developers can use Django for both front- and backend web development, it's useful for frontend developers, backend web developers, and full-stack web developers. Large enterprises such as Instagram, Mozilla, and Pinterest are driven by Django and contribute to the Django community. Everyone from entry-level web developers to senior web architects can make a promising career with Django.\nWhat are some alternatives to Django?\nIn the world of Python-based web frameworks, there are dozens of contenders. Flask is a popular Django alternative. Those who are new to web development may find Flask easy to adapt to, as its structure is clean and rigid. Both are based on Python, but Django requires more individualized knowledge. Another popular alternative to Django is TurboGears. TurboGears does not have the feature set of Django but has some extensive database management support. Other alternatives include Web2Py, Tornado, and CherryPy. When looking at Django, Flask, TurboGears, and other frameworks, it's important to contemplate a few factors: price, support, community, features, and integration. While many are better for niche situations, developers often consider Django to be the best all-around.\nWhat is AJAX in Django?\nAJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, which allows web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging data to and from the server. This means you can update parts of a web page without reloading the complete web page.\nWhat is Django used for?\nDjango is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nWe have prepared this course in the simplest way for beginners and have prepared three different projects to help them understand better.\n\nIn this course, you need basic knowledge about Python.\n\nThis course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level in web development.\nIf you are new to web development and have some knowledge about Python, you will learn anything you need to start to Python’s Django to web development.\nYou will encounter many businesses that use Python Django for web development. Today, big organizations such as the Instagram mobile website, Mozilla, and Openstack are using Django. Thanks to the large libraries provided, the number of companies and enterprises using python is increasing day by day. Python is the most popular programming language for data science processes in recent years. The world we are in is experiencing the age of informatics. In order to take part in this world and create your own opportunities, Python and its Django library will be the right choice for you. With this course, you can step into the world of web development.\n\n\nFresh Content\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

If you need more reasons to learn to build websites, then read on…\n\n\nWhy should you learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?\n\n\nBuilding websites allows you to do creative work from anywhere in the world, and with improvements in skill, it can become a lucrative career. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most practical and modern languages to begin learning if you want to become a web developer.\n\n\nThis course will take you from knowing nothing about computer science to building and launching your very own website in under 6 hours. After seven years of coding, I designed a course that I think is the most useful, practical, and simple introduction to learning how to code.\n\n\n2) Why should you choose this course?\n\n\nReason #1: You’ll learn by building a portfolio website\n\nI believe the best way to learn is by doing. This course teaches the essential web development languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js by having you build a highly practical project - a portfolio website.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a live portfolio website where you can showcase your own work as a web developer, designer, photographer, product manager, painter, or any other theme you can think of! You can change the fonts and text to fit your personal style and have something tangible to show to the world.\n\n\nReason #2: I’m the right teacher for you\n\nI struggled A LOT when I was learning to code. I am not the smartest person on Earth. For that reason, I explain things simply and carefully. I am good at explaining things in a way that anyone can understand. Coding is hard! Debugging (solving errors in your code) can be frustrating and take tons of hours of Googling! I empathize with my students because I was there once too, learning to code just like you.\n\n\nI have a Bachelors degree from Brown University in Computer Science and Visual Art. I’ve worked as a software engineer and as a user experience designer for over seven years.\n\n\nLearning to easily build websites has been one of the biggest breakthroughs I’ve made as a developer, so I want to share that knowledge in an accessible format with new developers.\n\n\n3) This course is for you if…\n\n… you’re a complete beginner and you want to learn to build websites\n… you already checked out some free resources online on HTML and CSS, but you’re struggling to build a full website with best practices and launch it live\n… you are a designer who wants to expand your skills into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js\n… you are a professional who is tired of Squarespace, Wix, and other web builder tools and want to easily and simply build a website yourself from scratch\n… you’re an an aspiring software engineer and you want to take a course that will be a great introduction to coding",

      "description": "This course will teach you how to write, use, and consume REST APIs in JavaScript.\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.\nClient-side JavaScript, in particular, has many APIs available to it — these are not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.  While there are many APIs available in JavaScript we often have to write our own custom API to allow transitions and access to data in our application.\nA REST API is a way of easily accessing web services. When a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. A RESTful API is stateless, separates concerns between client-server, allows caching of data client-side and it utilizes standardized base URLs and methods to perform the actions required to manipulate, add, or delete data.\nEach section is designed to be completed in one day, along with a hands-on practice activity to be completed before moving on to the next module.\nThis course assumes the following as prerequisite knowledge:\nIntermediate to Advanced JavaScript\nUse of the Browser DOM\nUse of database CRUD transactions\nBasics of Node.js",

Ractive.JS is the perfect way to get interactive apps and this course is the PERFECT way for you to learn this brilliant technology.\n\nRactive JS is not a framework, but rather a JavaScript library that can be added on to any HTML and JavaScript framework. It is quite similar to React JS, but it still stands miles apart, making it easier for you to turn your static pages into dynamic content. Ractive was designed by theguardian news website for their application, making it faster and easier to update.\nRactive transforms your HTML templates into blueprints for your apps and is small and unobtrusive. Ractive relies on your Mustache templates and converts them into a lightweight representation of the DOM, updating your real DOM only when changes occur.\nThis technology has been in the around since 2013, but is slowly now gaining importance in the field of dynamic applications. There are NO COURSES that directly help you learn and master Ractive, until NOW.\nOur Ractive tutorial has been designed in collaboration with experts to help you learn this brilliant technology and boost your development skills. Breaking Ractive down into 6 sections, the course covers everything you need to know about this amazing JavaScript library.\nThe first five sections cover RactiveJS, including what is Ractive, how to get started with the library, incorporating it with your current app, mustache templates, working with events, data bindings and how Ractive can simplify the process, as well as multiple different animations and transitions that can be used in your app with Ractive.\nThe last section gives you hand-on experience of actually using the technology and building an app from scratch. You will use Ractive, NodeJS, Webpack, and Babel to build a user manager application.\nWith so much to learn, what are you waiting for? Let’s get started and bring your app a step closer to the future.",

The front-end API’s is responsible to monitor and control the whole API services.\nChanging the API configuration will make the API services adapt for project execution. Transformation policies will help you to perform the changes in the API section.\nActivity and diagnostics logs will support the API’s security functions and real-time visibility is also possible with View metrics.\nYou should be aware of revision handling and all functions to perform API without any error. For this, you need proper training and knowledge from a real-time expert. In this program, you will be trained by the corporate and software trainer, Sandeep Soni. This course is a gateway to establish your potential to launch a full-fledged API program that will be useful for your project execution.\nBenefits of API Management\nWork with any host, API, and scale.\nAttract more developers.\nSecure and optimize your APIs.\nGain insights into your APIs.\nTo use API Management, administrators create APIs. Each API consists of one or more operations, and each API can be added to one or more products. To use an API, developers subscribe to a product that contains that API, and then they can call the API's operation, subject to any usage policies that may be in effect.\n\n\nAPIs and operations\nAPIs are the foundation of an API Management service instance. Each API represents a set of operations available to developers. Each API contains a reference to the back-end service that implements the API, and the map of its operations to the operations implemented by the back-end service. Operations in API Management are highly configurable, with control\nover URL mapping, query and path parameters, request and response content, and operation response caching. Rate limit, quotas, and IP restriction policies can also be implemented at the API or individual operation level.\n\n\nProducts:\nProducts are how APIs are provided to developers.\nProducts in API Management have one or more APIs, and are configured with a title, description, and terms of use.\nProducts can be Open or Protected. Protected products must be subscribed to before they can be used, while open products can be used without a subscription. Subscription approval is configured at the product level and can either require administrator approval or be auto-approved.\nWhen a product is ready for use by developers it can be published.\nGroups are used to manage the visibility of products to developers.\n\n\nGroups:\nAPI Management has the following immutable system groups.\nAdministrators - Azure subscription administrators are of this group. Administrators manage API Management service instances, creating the APIs, operations, and products that are used by developers. members\nDevelopers - Authenticated developer portal users fall into this group. Developers are the customers that build applications using your APIs. Developers are granted access to the developer portal and build applications that call the operations of an API.\nGuests - Unauthenticated developer portal users, such as prospective customers visiting the developer portal of an API Management instance fall into this group. They can be granted certain read-only access, such as the ability to view APIs but not call them.\nNote: In addition to these system groups, administrators can create custom groups or leverage external groups in associated Azure Active Directory tenants.\n\n\nPolicies:\nPolicies are a powerful capability of API Management that allows the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration.\nPolicies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API.\nPopular statements include format conversion from XML to JSON and call rate limiting to restrict the number of incoming calls from a developer, and many other policies are available.",

In other words, web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images, or other resources through a web browser.\nHTML is the basic building block of the web and actually isn’t a technical programming language. It is responsible for the structure of the website.\nIn this course, we will start with HTML, which is the basis of web development and then we will continue to learn CSS.\nThis course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level.

Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.\nWhy is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?\nHTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.\nWhat is responsive design?\nResponsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\nWhat is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?\nCSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.\nWhat careers use CSS?\nCSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now HTML CSS: Code and Design Websites With HTML and CSS course\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",
