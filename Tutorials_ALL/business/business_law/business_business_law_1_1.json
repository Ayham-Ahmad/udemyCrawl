As it introduces these topics, students will also learn key terms, words, vocabulary, grammatical concepts, familiarize themselves with technical terms, and develop legal English and communication skills. The course is flexible and can be useful for internationally-trained law students or non-U.S. lawyers, prospective paralegals, college and university students who are interested in law school or the paralegal profession, but who have no background or understanding of the U.S. legal system or common law systems, more generally. LLM program students and students with an LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or similar first foreign degree in law may also find this course useful.\nThe course lectures include structured outlines, examples, and illustrations. The instructor who holds a J.D. (Juris Doctor - U.S. law degree) presents via video and audio (listening practice) format. The course includes illustrations, handouts, and select exercises. Students are immersed in visuals, speech, and audio taught by a U.S. trained (multi-lingual) lawyer. This online course provides an overview of first year law school topics, technical terms and language, and introduces both the legal industry, court system, and legal education. It can be useful for both international law students as well as college students who are interested in a legal education path. It can be a good introductory course for current, prospective, and future paralegals as well. It can be considered part of a series of paralegal skills courses. For the purpose of language development, this course will work is best in combination with outside tutoring or practice where the student can practice speaking and presenting.\nAn array of topics is discussed including common law systems, unique aspects of the U.S. legal system, the concept of precedent, oral and written communication considerations, core areas of law, legal education, and the legal industry. The course assumes students have little to no knowledge of the U.S. legal system and is cognizant of the goal to develop Legal English skills for international and foreign professionals and law students. It can also serve as a good overview for students interested in a highly practical preview of the legal industry and occupation. The course includes extensive lecture and visual materials; however, it is not intended to substitute for post-secondary or formal instruction. This course is also not intended to be continuing education and is not qualified for such credit in any jurisdiction. Moreover it is only for educational / informational purposes and is not presented as legal advice.\nThis course is a good introduction and suggests several resources that can be used to continue learning beyond the completion of this skills course.  It is also part of a series of skills courses should students choose to expand and continue their learning journey about the law and legal topics.",

      "description": "Hardly a day goes by without a headline devoted to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is an international hub with a fascinating history and a central role in global trade and finance. Its colourful journey to that destination began with its lease to the British by the Emperor of China. This byproduct of \"gunboat diplomacy\" left a legacy which has influenced China's relations with the West down to the present. Hong Kong was under British rule during the 1911 Revolution which led to the end of Imperial China as well as during the struggle between the Nationalists and Communists after World War II. Both those events had dramatic repercussions for the residents of Hong Kong.\nIn this course we explore Hong Kong's period as a British colony, right up to the handover to China in 1997. We consider Hong Kong's position as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, following a \"one country, two systems\" approach. We also review what this might mean for its people following the end of a 50-year transition period. Or perhaps even sooner. The Umbrella Revolution has provided some early signs, as we approach the midway point in Hong Kong's period of transition. Viewers wishing to do a deeper dive can explore some of the supplementary reading materials to understand the background to today's headlines and tomorrow's possible direction.",

      "description": "Covers New Labour Laws and Statutory Compliances\nLaw has a very important role to play in what any HR manager does in a day, though it may not be always apparent. You actually require a good hold of different laws starting from the recruitment, to their onboarding, mandatory paper work, different benefits such as PF, ESI, bonus, gratuity etc.\nAlso you will need to ensure that the decision of dismissal is taken after proper disciplinary proceedings. If you do not follow proper procedures, the company may have to pay compensation for wrongful termination or reinstate the employee with back wages in some cases.\nIn fact, as you go up the chain, legal knowledge becomes indispensable. Let’s say you are drafting a leave policy for a company, and fail to check the relevant Shops and Establishments Act of the state, you will almost certainly get it wrong. The consequence can be paying heavy fines by the company if an inspector comes visiting, a potentially negative impact on the brand and embarrassment in front of other employees.\nAlso if you talk about different functions of HR such as Recruitment, Training and Development, Performance Appraisal, Grievance handling etc then you will notice that a part, small to big, is played by the respective managers as well. But labour laws are something which other people usually don’t have much of an idea and if you make this strong then this will give you a lot of importance and growth in that company.\n\n\nCode on Social Security, 2020\nSection 1:\nSelf-Assessment\nImportance of Legal knowledge for HRs\nBasics of Legal\nIntroduction: Code on Social Security, 2020\nSection 2: Preliminary\nPreliminary\nSection 3: Social Security Organisations\nSocial Security Organisations\nSection 4: Provident Fund\nProvident Fund\nFAQs\nSection 5: Employee State Insurance Corporation\nEmployee State Insurance Corporation\nFAQs\nSection 6: Gratuity\nGratuity\nSection 7: Maternity Benefits\nMaternity Benefits\nSection 8: Employee's Compensation\nEmployee's Compensation\nSection 9: For unorganised workers, Gig workers and Platform workers\nFor unorganised workers, Gig workers and Platform workers\nSection 10: Offences and Penalties\nOffences and Penalties",

While this course has been fundamentally designed for employees and workers, the principles laid down in course should assist you to prepare your case and represent yourself at any court.\n\n\nTimes are tough and you never know when you would be dismissed or someone at your workplace may discriminate against you because of your disability or gender. In this course I will guide you about how to protect your rights and if you suffer a detriment at your work what legal action you can take without any legal help and how to do that. The course will also help you to become confident and appear a reliable person in the employment tribunals, who the judges should believe.\n\n\nIt is natural to become nervous while giving evidence. This course will give you tips on how to deal with the other party's lawyer while giving evidence and how to ask questions from your employer's witnesses. I have seen what mistakes the Claimants make and this course will included guidance on the points where Claimants could make mistake. I will give you examples of how to make your case strong and what steps you need to take and follow through the process. What are the case management orders? What are preliminary hearings including telephone conferences and video link conferences. I will show you examples of most of the documents you expect to see during your claim.\n\n\nI will teach you tips and tricks on how to get information from your employer that goes against them and help strengthen your case, applications that you should make to the employment tribunals. I will guide you in relation to the time limits and how to fill in your claim form and submit it to the employment tribunals.\nThe course will also guide you as to:\nHow to prepare a bundle of documents (along with the index) and your witness statement.\nHow to calculate your losses and how to prepare a document called Schedule of Loss\nWhat is Scott Schedule and how to present your claims in orderly manner - for example who said what discriminatory comments on what date and who else was present.\n\n\nI will also give you free templates in this course of the main documents. I will guide you on how to calculate your basic award and your compensatory award and your injury to feelings awards.\n\n\nMy aim is to give you confidence so that you can handle the processes and procedures in a language that you can understand, free of jargon!\n\n\nIf you follow the principles given in this course there is no reason why you should not get good groundings to represent yourself in any court as broadly the principles remain the same. You just need to be aware of what valuable help is available out there and what actions you could take to help yourself.\n\n\nIf you are someone who is representing a member of your family or a friend or you are an employment consultant, you may also find this course very useful. You may also be a trade union member or may want to become one and want to assist your fellow employees.\n\n\nThis course is also useful if you have a lawyer but want to gain a better understanding of how the tribunal system works and what should you expect from your lawyer.\nIf you are ready to help yourself, enrol now and start learning how you can put your best case forward.

      "description": "Welcome to the Business Law course. This course includes 3 sections also presented as independent courses for your convenience: Business Law Basic Concepts, Business Law and Ethics, and Business Law and the Manager's Responsibilities.\n\n\nBusiness Law Basic Concepts\nThe risk becomes even greater when managers aren't fully aware of the business laws that affect them and their organizations. As a manager, you serve as a leader and as a representative for your organization. Accordingly, you're responsible for being informed of the laws that govern business.\nYou need to comply with these laws yourself, as well as ensuring that your department and employees are aware of the law and comply with it. Failing to do this can potentially get you and your organization into a great deal of trouble.\nIn this section, you'll learn about the different areas of business law and what they encompass. You'll also learn about the responsibilities of managers in each of these areas. This will help equip you to protect yourself, the employees you manage, and your company.\nBusiness Law and Ethics\nAs a manager, you have both legal and ethical responsibilities. Your conduct is expected to meet both the letter and the spirit of the law. Managers who bypass their ethical responsibilities risk getting themselves and their companies into deep legal trouble.\nCorporate scandals have ruined both careers and companies. As a manager, you need to learn about business ethics and how to use ethics as a guiding rationale when dealing with your responsibilities. This is crucial because ethical principles provide the basis for the spirit of the law.\nThis section guides you in differentiating between ethics and the law, as well as in recognizing areas where the two concepts overlap. It explains the difference between following the letter of the law and following the spirit of the law. And it covers a process you can use to make ethical decisions that comply with the spirit of the law.\nThe course also outlines typical obstacles to ethical behavior in business, and steps managers can take to build a strong culture of ethics in their companies.\nBy understanding and providing ethical management, you'll help to encourage ethical behavior in your organization. This can protect you, your employees, and your company, and help attract both customers and investors. Ultimately, ethical behavior means better business.\nBusiness Law and the Manager's Responsibilities\nA corporation is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its shareholders, directors, and managers. In practice, this means that executives and managers of a corporation may be shielded from the company's liabilities by what's referred to as the corporate veil.\nHowever, managers shouldn't trust the corporate veil to protect them legally. When they consider it necessary, the courts pierce this veil, finding individual managers legally culpable for their behavior, or even for the behavior of their employees.\nSo, as a manager, you need to protect yourself, the employees you manage, and your organization from becoming implicated in illegal or unethical activities, and from facing legal consequences as a result. This means you have to know and meet your responsibilities, always ensuring that your own actions are both legal and ethical.\nIt also means ensuring that you fulfil your managerial duties – for example, communicating clear expectations and policies to employees, and responding to reports or signs of inappropriate behavior.\nIn this last section, you'll learn more about the corporate veil and about the types of factors that typically cause the courts to pierce this veil. You'll learn how best to handle concerns and warnings of potentially illegal behavior.\nAnd you'll learn how to help ensure that your communications don't expose you or your organization to legal liability. Finally, you'll learn about vicarious liability as it applies to managers, and about steps you can take to avoid this.\n\n\nSo, this is the broad picture. This is what you can expect from the course and you can already start. No go ahead and push that   \"Register Now\" button and see you inside the course!",

This was a mini-course which is now built into a full course, to help individuals and organizations learn about cyberlaw and all that entails. Law is everywhere, cyber is everywhere, so cyberlaw is now a part of our society and daily life.\nWe all need to know about law and cyberlaw. Allow me to share some of my knowledge with you.\nThis course is not for everyone! But it is right for some. It is academic type lectures, using my PowerPoint slides, my research, my brain, my skills (such as they are). There are no fancy graphics and no fancy video editing. It is not entertainment and you will need an attention span of at least ten minutes. Consider your personal preferences, and see a few sample videos before you decide if this is right for you. If you have a problem or need something, message me.\nWhy this course? I have learned about cyberlaw over the years. First prosecuting cybercrime, then in private practice. I teach students and professionals about law, technology, cybersecurity, cybercrime, and privacy. I've written books on the topic. It was time to share these materials with a broader audience and I already have other courses on Udemy.\nIt was time to build this course and I started with a short, free course (free courses must be under 2 hours). After I published my book on cyberlaw, I built it into a fuller course, longer than two hours (courses that exceed two hours can not be offered for free).\nHere is the outline (don't forget to download the handout with lecture 1 and see my resources webpage).\nCourse Introduction\nIntroduction to law\nEntering the digital domain of cyberspace\nCriminal cyberlaw\nCivil law I, Traditional areas of civil law applied to cyberspace\nCivil law II, Data law\nInternational cyber conflict\nSpeech online\nOrganization management and compliance with cyberlaw\nConclusion and thank you\nLaw is for everyone and that means cyberlaw too. It is not just for lawyers.\nIf you read this description and take the course, I hope you will see that the course meets and exceeds the description, with considerable quality and effort. If you see that, and feel it is worthy of a five star review, I would appreciate that to recognize my efforts.\nRevision note: On 3/14/2025 I started building this from a free (less than 2 hour course) into a full course. I completed this build out on 4/6/2025. Now it is an eleven hour course with all new content. There is one lecture to parallel each chapter of my 2025 book on cyberlaw.",

      "description": "Welcome to the course \"Global trademark search using the TMView database\".\nThis course will help you to learn how to do a trademark search using the global database TMView on your own.\nBeing able to search for prior registered trademarks is an essential skill when launching a new brand in the market because this will enable you to avoid the many legal pitfalls.\nBefore starting to use a new brand, every company has to be sure that there are no early registered identical or similar trademarks for identical or similar goods and services.\nThis is crucial because in case such marks exist their owners can object to any commercial use of later similar marks by initiating legal proceedings that can be time and cost-consuming.\nSelecting a new trouble-free brand is not an easy task taking into account that nowadays there are millions of registered trademarks.\nTHIS COURSE WILL GIVE YOU IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ABOUT THE WAY YOU CAN DO A TRADEMARK SEARCH by using the TMView global database. This database, developed by the European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), covers countries not only from Europe but all around the world including the US, Canada, Brazil, China, Japan, Australia, and many others.\nWhy choose this course?\n\n\nThis course will help you to build a strong brand name that can distinguish itself from already registered trademarks;\n\n\nYou will be able to find out early registered trademarks that could represent obstacles to the registration of your own trademark with the Patent offices;\n\n\nSearching for registered trademarks can help you to avoid potential legal pitfalls or even lawsuits;\n\n\nYou will be able to check whether someone else tries to register a trademark that resembles your own and to take legal actions against such a mark;\nAt the end of the course, you will be provided with a full PDF file that covers, in a systematic way all main aspects related to the trademark search conducted through the TMView global database.\n\n\nThe materials available in this course are for educational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice or opinion. You should contact an attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem. The aim of this course is to teach you how to do a search for trademarks on your own, but not how to assess trademarks' identity or similarity from a legal point of view;  the latter requires in-depth legal knowledge and expertise which varies country by country.

      "description": "Unique course, instructed by Top EU Expert (Chairman EU Certification Committee of EADPP), made available for larger audience at affordable cost (commercial EU value of this course is € 3,500 ex VAT). In this resourceful course, beginners in the fields of privacy and data protection will learn the foundations of privacy and data protection compliance key concepts and the 6 components of a basic GDPR work plan in plain English for career boosting and personal development. With this course, students can opt for official EU certification and registration.\nWhy this course?\nCompetition in today’s job market is fierce. Regardless of the industry, those who can clearly and immediately illustrate their knowledge and expertise will have a distinct advantage over other potential job applicants. In the field of European Data Protection, nothing shows your qualifications better than official EU certification sought by top employers.\nSecure your place in the data protection economy. Show off your knowledge and skills by adding an official certificate to your CV. Everybody on this planet is directly or indirectly connected to subjects of privacy and data protection and needs to know the foundations of data protection in our modern digital society.\nThere is an ever growing internationally recognized demand and need for employees of companies (data controllers) to know at least the basics of privacy and data protection and the meaning of this in daily practices. This applies for everyone, not only in his/her role as an employee, but also as a ‘citizen’ and as a private individual (parent, child). The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be explained from a practical lens of the data controller who needs to implement appropriate measures to protect personal data. The GDPR is influential for data protection practices around the globe.\nBased on more than 25+ years of practical experience as a data protection professional (as business manager and lawyer), the instructor – who has been involved in many European initiatives in the field – will guide you through the main pillars of the GDPR (at introductory level 1) which will help to boost your insights, right from the start.\nUnlike many other courses in the field of GDPR data protection, in this course the instructor, a seasoned professor and advisor both in academia and in practice (at private, public and semi—public EU institutes) maintains a very practical hands-on approach of ‘FAIR’ and ‘EASY’ learning.\nAlthough privacy and data protection are relevant for our daily lives and can be used in many practical ways, in literature and in many publications by so called ‘top specialists’ these concepts are usually presented as ‘vague and complex’. In practice this leads to many misunderstandings or miscommunications. How to fix this? Part of the solution is to provide clear answers to fundamental questions. That is basically the philosophy behind this course.\nThis course will provide you with the foundational knowledge to think as a (employee of a) data controller who is responsible and liable for processing personal data.\nThis introductory course will start with a solid, clear understanding of the key concepts (such as the difference between privacy and data protection, privacy by design and default, technical and organisational measures et cetera) as used in the GDPR (and most other international data protection best practices) and what a data controller is supposed in order to comply with GDPR obligations.\n\n\nRequirements\nYou don't need to have any prior knowledge of privacy and data protection\nSome of the provided materials you may wish to print\n\n\nUnique learning: FAIR and EASY\nThis foundation course is designed to encourage students to get a proper and sound understanding of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) based on two learning techniques.\nFAIR as an acronym for ‘Fast learning by Asking Iterating Relevance’ by repeatedly asking the question of ‘why?’.\nEASY as an acronym for ‘Educated Answers Suit You’ by repeated asking the question of ‘what does this mean in practice’?\nParamount technique for this is using the SMART check for any action in practice which should be (Specific, Measurable, Accepted, Realistic and Time restricted)\nFair and easy learning has been developed and applied by the instructor during his 25+ years of experience in education and training of many privacy and data protection professionals providing for:\nDemystification of complex issues\nLearning to be aware of distinguishing between ‘facts’ and ‘opinions’\nDiscussing bare essentials (by sticking to the core rationales)\nStructured overviews for comprehensive understanding\nThe course content is based on the learning principles of the European Institute for Privacy Audit, Compliance and Certification (EIPACC) and is agnostic of disciplinary backgrounds of students (law, IT, security or any other discipline) and will discuss certain terms and definitions using ‘lay men language.’ In this way, we will get to the bare essentials of what is discussed.\n\n\nUnique course resources for Udemy students\nFree online access to relevant parts of GDPR Resources (official GDPR related texts), value: € 100\nDiscount VIP code (10%) for several GDPR online learning materials (upon availability) with a value of: € 100\n\n\nCourse Goals\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to:\nMake a clear distinction between privacy, data protection and data subject rights compliance\nList the most important ways (mechanisms) for data controllers to become compliant\nCheck if implemented data protection measures are ‘appropriate’\nClarify 6 steps to become data protection compliant (work plan basic design)\n\n\nTarget Students and Starting Practioners\nPrimarily meant for students (legal, and non-legal) and starting practitioners who want to get a proper, well-structured introduction to basic compliance obligations of the data controller, learn key terms and concepts used in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and learn about a GDPR Work Plan Design in plain English and want to get an official European Certification for this to boost their careers.\nThroughout this course references are made to the legal text of the GDPR (attached as course material) and is explained in ‘layman terms.’\n\n\nThis course is especially interesting for students and starting practitioners for businesses:\nStudents who want to bolster their general privacy and GDPR data protection knowledge.\nStudents who want to scan the field of privacy and data protection for future careers\nStudents who want to refresh and check their present state of data protection knowledge.\nStudents who want to get familiar with key concepts like privacy and data protection.\nStudents who are not yet active in the field of GDPR data protection and looking for practical guidance as how to set up a basic design of a GDPR compliance work plan to be used as work.\nStudents who do not want to spend much time to understand the key rationales behind different ‘principles for processing personal data’.\nStudents who want to get explained (in layman terms) what ‘data subject rights’ are.\nStudents who want to obtain insights in different compliance mechanisms.\nStudents who want to get explained (in layman terms) what the main difference is between technical and organizational compliance measures.\nStudents who want to get explained (in layman terms) what the main methods are for transfer of international data outside the European Union.\nStudents who feel overwhelmed (or even maybe intimidated) by GDPR terms and definitions and want to this to get demystified.\nThis introductory course is especially interesting for starting practitioners for businesses:\nStarting specialists in the field of privacy and data protection\nStarting privacy officers\nStarting data protection officers\nStarting compliance specialists\nStarting privacy and data protection compliance managers\nStarting data protection specialists (Law, IT, Security, Compliance & Ethics)\nStarting information managers\nStarting privacy and data protection representatives\nStarting privacy and data protection auditors\nStarting privacy and data protection managers\nStarting privacy and data protection project managers\nStarting privacy and data protection risk officers\nStarting privacy and data protection security officers\nStarting privacy and data protection auditor\nStarting general managers who need to know the basics of privacy and data protection compliance\n\n\nAnyone else who (professionally or privately) wants to grow his/her basic knowledge of certified privacy and data protection and wants to get certified in these fields (as holder of an official EU certificate).\n\n\nPursued level of training for this course\nThis course is designed to acquire basic knowledge and comprehension (level 1) to get the student familiarized with theoretical and practical key compliance concepts and definitions used in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n\nDisclaimer\nAlthough this course is based on official EU or EU related primary resources (such as official texts, official guidelines and official certification schemes) the course instructor might share practical insights based on more than 25+ years of practical experience that may not exactly be in line with these primary resources. However, students who complete this course are eligible for official certification and registration in the European Union.\n\n\nAny Queries?\nIn case of any queries, please feel free to send an email to the instructor.\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\nProfessor mr drs Romeo F. Kadir MA MSc LLM LLM (Adv) EMBA EMoC - Chairman of the EU Certification Committee of the European Association of Data Protection Professionals (EADPP) and Chairman of the Academic Quality Management Board (AQMB) of the European Institute for Privacy Audit, Compliance and Certification (EIPACC)- is a much respected European industry expert in the field of privacy and data protection.

Be aware of mode of getting a firm registered with the authorities.\n2. Understand the effect of registration of a firm upon the rights of partners’ inter-se and the rights of the third parties.\n3. Note the effect of non-registration on rights of partners and the third parties.\n4. Learn the various circumstances when a firm is dissolved.\n5. The consequences and the effects of the dissolution upon rights and liabilities of various parties.\nSUMMARY\nRegistration of a firm is effected by the Registrar of Firms by recording in the Register of Firms an entry of the statement relating to registration furnished to him. The Act does not make registration of the firm compulsory, yet the effect of the rules relating to the consequences of non-registration is such as practically necessitates the registration of the firm at one time or other. Certain disabilities have been imposed on partners of an unregistered firm seeking to enforce certain claims in the Civil Courts. A firm which is not registered is not able to enforce its claim against third parties in the Civil Courts; and any partner who is not registered is not able to enforce his claim either against third parties or against the fellow partners. An unregistered partner may, however, sue for the dissolution of the firm or for accounts only if the firm is already dissolved.\nDissolution of a firm means the breaking up or extinction of the relationship which subsisted between all the partners of the firm under various circumstances contemplated by Act. A partnership can be dissolved only in accordance with the manner prescribed under the Act.",

The examples used in the course relate to legal drafting and research specifically, but the principles are of broader application and could also be used effectively for other types of professional advice.\nIn the first section of the course we'll cover some foundations in relation to GenAI, prompting techniques, common mistakes and pitfalls, and the broader context of legal and professional obligations. We'll then move on in the rest of the course to work through a framework for prompting that is optimised for legal use-cases. We'll also look at some advanced prompting techniques and work through some practical examples. The templates and examples are available as downloadable materials.\nLearning GenAI prompting techniques can open up many opportunities to enhance your legal skills and ways of working, enabling you to work more effectively and carry out certain tasks much more quickly - which can dramatically help with workload management. It can help you to quickly identify effective solutions to complex problems, it can give you pointers if you are stuck on something, it can provide incredibly useful first drafts of contractual clauses, advice notes, letters, marketing copy, and other written materials that you need to produce.\nUltimately, GenAI is a powerful tool that requires skill and practice to use effectively. Professionals who master prompt engineering will have numerous and significant advantages in efficiency, client service, capability, and employability.\nThe question isn't whether AI will transform legal practice and professional services more widely - this is something that is already happening.\nSo, this course will help you catch up with everything that is going on and will equip you with the practical tools and knowledge to be able to use GenAI tools confidently and effectively.",

      "description": "This is an introductory course covering the basics of United States Immigration Law and is best considered a supplement (study-aid) to a formal class, a good overview of the topic, or a refresher to sharpen existing skills. Topics we cover include: important concepts and issues in U.S. immigration law (e.g., status, visas, I-94s, EADs, etc.), terminology and acronyms (e.g., AOS, USCIS), agencies and their unique roles in immigration programs, and basic overview of the family and employment-based preference system and associated immigration queues (e.g., priority dates and the visa bulletin). Please note that this course does not provide coverage of special humanitarian programs or immigration removal relief. The course focuses on the basics of immigration, non-immigrant visas (NIVs), and the basics of family-based and employment-based immigration. It explains what lawful permanent resident (LPR or \"green card\" holder) means and some common paths people take to get a green card.\nLaw students and new immigration paralegals, or those who are interested in immigration paralegal jobs will find this course a useful introduction and overview of immigration in the United States of America. Law offices can also using this course as part of their training or on-boarding program for their immigration paralegals new on the job.\nThe course starts by introducing unique aspects of immigration law in the United States. It then introduces the sources of law, including statutes and regulations (e.g., Immigration and Nationality Act - INA) as well as the various immigration agencies that apply the laws and make decisions (e.g., DHS, DOS, DOL, DOJ). There's a consistent effort to introduce you to key terms and concepts, including both the formal names as well as common terms of art often used by immigration lawyers and paralegals.\nThe course includes illustrations, infographics, and examples that walk the student through some of the most common documents encountered in the immigration context (e.g., Forms I-20, DS-2019, I-797 Notices, Visa pages, admissions tamps, Forms I-94, and passport biographic pages). The course includes extensive lecture and visual materials; however, it is not a substitute for post-secondary instruction in immigration law. This course is also not intended to be continuing education and is not qualified for such credit in any jurisdiction. The course includes a certificate of completion.The course is for general information and educational purposes and does not provide any legal advice. However, it is carefully prepared to save you time and introduce you to the most fundamental and important terms and concepts, so you can jump start your learning.\nThe course focuses on topics of interest to immigration paralegals, global talent and global mobility teams, and human resources (HR) professionals in the U.S. who want a fast and effective introduction to the most common and essential concepts. It is also a good orientation/training for immigration paralegals in training who want to supplement their formal training or studies or current paralegals, legal assistants, law clerks, or lawyers who are exploring immigration paralegal jobs or paralegal positions at immigration law firms.\nThe lessons focus on United States immigration law and are taught primarily in English. The course may also be applicable to other common law legal systems (e.g., India, United Kingdom - UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia) by analogy, but please keep in mind each country has its own rules and requirements for temporary and permanent residence and immigration.",

      "description": "This is the course that I wish I had access to when I first graduated from university and became a legal professional tasked with the review and drafting of contracts.\nTo the uninitiated, contract review and drafting can be an overwhelming and stressful experience. This is because contracts are usually wordy, complex and full of legal jargon.\nIf you are new or inexperienced when it comes to contract review and drafting, it can be difficult to know where or how to start - and so easy to get lost and confused - when you’re handed a contract to read and assess. Looming deadlines and commercial pressures do not make things any easier.\nI recall these painful challenges from first-hand experience during my early days as a lawyer. Throughout my experiences as a legal counsel, business executive and adjunct lecturer, I have also seen my peers, colleagues and students experience the same.\nThis course was created and designed to help ease these challenges and to empower those who need to review and draft contracts but who lack the experience, knowledge and skills to do so confidently and effectively.\nIn this course, you will learn about five (5) key elements (or building blocks) of contracts which are the need-to-know essentials for contract review and drafting, namely:\nObligations\nConditions precedent\nPowers\nRepresentations\nWarranties\nThis course will equip you with practical knowledge and appreciation of these key elements through a structured series of bite-sized videos and guided practice questions. After completing this course, you will have a toolkit of methods and frameworks to help enhance your review and drafting of contracts.\nIt is my sincere hope that this course will help you to review and draft contracts with far less stress and much more confidence, and provide you with a solid foundation for building your contracting expertise.",

      "description": "The False Claims Act (FCA) is a pivotal federal law aimed at combating fraud against government programs, particularly in the healthcare sector. Enacted during the Civil War, the FCA imposes liability on individuals and companies who defraud governmental programs. With provisions for whistleblowers to bring claims on behalf of the government, it serves as a powerful tool for uncovering and addressing fraudulent activities.\nThis course provides a set of meticulously designed practice tests to enhance your understanding of the False Claims Act. Through a series of multiple-choice questions, each accompanied by detailed explanations, you will delve into the intricacies of the FCA, including the legal framework, key provisions, and the mechanisms for enforcement.\nTopics covered include the definition and implications of \"knowing\" violations, the significance of materiality, and the consequences of false claims. You will also explore the qui tam provision, which allows private individuals to file lawsuits on behalf of the government and potentially receive a share of the recovered funds. Additionally, the course examines the roles of key agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in enforcing the FCA.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of how the False Claims Act operates, the penalties for non-compliance, and the importance of maintaining integrity in billing practices. This course is essential for healthcare providers, compliance officers, legal professionals, and anyone involved in federal program billing who seeks to ensure compliance and avoid the severe penalties associated with FCA violations.",

      "description": "This is a quick skills course that can serve as a supplement (study-aid) to a formal class, a good overview of the topic, or a refresher to sharpen existing skills. Topics covered include principles of legal research, legal writing, legal communication, and tips for being effective and successful on various tasks or assignments.\nThe course starts by providing a functional description of legal analysis, including the research, synthesis, and summary of relevant and applicable laws, as well as the factual analysis that courts and lawyers do to apply the law to the facts. Next, the course describes the objectives of individual and organizational clients when they seek legal help from a law office or law practice. Finally, the course covers fundamental aspects of the preliminary legal research and writing (drafting) that paralegals may be tasked with conducting for the supervising attorney. Notably, the course includes coverage of the practical tools as well as the informal resources that paralegals often have access to in a law office or department that can help them be efficient and provide closer to final drafts for their reviewing attorney. The course includes discussion of legal communication, including shorter internal and external writings such as emails. It includes a brief discussion of artificial intelligence (AI) and how it fits into the process of human-driven legal research and writing.\nThe course includes illustrations, extensive infographics, and examples that walk the student through the thought process that can help tackle a new drafting or research assignment from their supervising attorney. The course includes extensive lecture and visual materials; however, it is not intended to substitute for post-secondary instruction in legal research and writing for paralegals. This course is also not intended to be continuing education and is not qualified for such credit in any jurisdiction. The course focuses on paralegals in the U.S. and is intended to be a highly practical skill building overview useful both to paralegals in training who want to supplement their formal studies or current paralegals, legal assistants, law clerks, or early-career lawyers who want to sharpen everyday skills to help them improve performance on the job.\nThe lessons focus on the United States (US) legal system and are taught primarily in English. The course may also be applicable to other common law legal systems (e.g., India, United Kingdom - UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia).",

Online-Shop zu gründen. Umfangreiche Programmierkenntnisse sind nicht mehr erforderlich. Viele Personen träumen von der eigenen Website oder dem eigenen Online-Shop. Endlich sein eigener Chef sein, oder sich nebenberuflich ein zweites Einkommen aufbauen.\nAllerdings müssen dabei mehrere Rechte beachtet werden. Sehr schnell kann es passieren, dass man in eine Internet-Falle tappt, ohne dass man sich dessen bewusst ist. Das fängt allein schon bei der Bezeichnung \"Geschäftsführer\" als Einzelunternehmer an.

Schließlich werden ja Rechnungen geschrieben und trägt die volle Verantwortung für die Website bzw. den Online-Shop.\nEs kann dann sehr schnell der Fall eintreten, dass man eine Abmahnung vom Anwalt erhält und es kann recht teuer werden zzgl. den Ärger und Frust.\nDamit Ihnen das nicht passiert, lernen Sie in diesem Online-Kurs, auf welche Punkte Sie achten sollten, wenn Sie sich selbstständig machen und eine Internetpräsenz aufbauen möchten.

      "description": "What is this course about? This series of lectures deals with the calculation of regulatory capital for insurance undertakings, under the Solvency II regulatory framework, through the so-called ‘Standard Formula’. The latter is a standardized average model for calculating regulatory capitals. Most insurance companies, under the Solvency II regime, use that. In contrast, insurance companies belonging to a group tend to develop ‘internal models’, to better capture the need for capital, according to their risk profile.\nThe Standard Formula consists of 6 modules that lead to 27 submodules. This course includes a comprehensive presentation for the ‘Market Risk Module’, which consists of 6 submodules:\nThe interest rate risk submodule,\nthe equity risk submodule,\nthe credit spread risk submodule,\nthe market concentrations risk submodule,\nthe currency risk submodule and\nthe property risk submodule.\nTo whom is this course for? The course is mainly addressed to people already working in the insurance industry (for example, insurance business executives, risk managers and external auditors) who would like to obtain a clear and comprehensive view of the Regulation regarding regulatory capitals. College students will find it interesting too, as it is a great introduction to the Regulation, which constitutes essential knowledge for someone to start their career in the insurance industry.\nWhy choose this course? The calculation of regulatory capital for insurance undertakings is based on a legal text named ‘the Delegated Regulation 2015/35’. This text contains all the relevant information, but in a rigid language. Very often, things are mixed, oddly placed in various locations of the text, making comprehensive understanding difficult. This course places things in the right position by using a clear, simple, but not simple-minded presentation of the topic. Last but not least: In every section a simple example is used to let you eventually understand how things work, while multiple-choice tests and practice assignments follow. At the end of the course, you will be able to not only understand and participate in discussions within your business environment about ‘regulatory capitals’, but also set up Excel files and participate in calculations, upgrading by that way your professional reputation.",

Tampoco de una serie de delitos comunes que son frecuentes en el mundo de la empresa o los negocios, tales como la apropiación indebida, robos y hurtos de insumos o productos, adulteración de balances en el contexto de un proceso de quiebra, suma y sigue.\nDerecho penal económico para negocios y empresas. Historia, elementos conceptuales y criminológicos fundamentales busca explicar aspectos esenciales de la teoría general y de la evolución de esta rama del derecho, en base a la teoría jurídica que se maneja en las cortes y tribunales de Europa continental y en un no menor número de países latinoamericanos.\nEsta rama del derecho penal se ha convertido en el talón de Aquiles de jueces, fiscales y policías debido, por un lado, a la complejidad intelectual que revisten los delitos de cuello blanco, y por otro, debido a la frecuente escasez de recursos materiales en la investigación y procesamiento de los responsables.\nCon este curso, y potenciales próximos lanzamientos en esta serie, buscamos disminuir la falta de preparación de toda la comunidad empresarial y judicial en estos asuntos, para contribuir al bagaje conceptual y entendimiento de esta importante arista del tráfico jurídico económico en la era de la globalización.\n*Todos los cursos del proyecto PFW son ofrecidos a precios increíbles, con miras a cumplir el objetivo principal de entregar un programa de alta calidad, derribando las barreras económicas que algún potencial interesado pueda padecer.\n*Para completar el programa, además de observar todas las clases, deberás responder breves cuestionarios de selección múltiple. No existen tareas adicionales y no hay límite de intentos para responder las preguntas.

In this course I'm glad to take you around on a tour in which I will show you more about authorship, royalties, distribution, publishing, masters and more. I will even show you the tools I use to protect and how I distribute my music on all platforms. I call the method \"The Fortress Of Sound Protection\". I recently achieved 250k monthly listeners on my main channel and I can ensure you that this class will provide you with information that you will be able to use for the rest of your life. The course is devided in two parts: Protect Your Sound and Protect Your Sound: Explained. The first part is more about cases, theory and easy to apply ways to protect your sound. The second module is more about the concrete steps to take in order to achieve bulletproof sound protection. Eventually I want you to be ready for the music industry and sleep like a baby when your music is out there!",

      "description": "This practical 78-minute course, “21 Tasks to Start Compliance to the PDPA,” is designed specifically for individuals and organisations looking to take their first practical steps towards compliance with Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). In addition, the principles in this book can be applied to most privacy laws too.\nParticipants will be introduced to a structured approach using the APSR Privacy Lifecycle: Assess, Protect, Sustain, Respond. Through this proven framework, learners will be guided through 21 essential tasks that will help them build a solid foundation for privacy management within their organisations. These tasks cover not only compliance but also strategies for enhancing privacy maturity over time.\nBy the end of the course, learners will be equipped to identify and map out key PDPA compliance activities, understand how to implement practical governance measures suitable for Small and Medium Enterprises, and develop an internal action plan to sustain compliance efforts. Each task is explained in straightforward, jargon-free language, making this course ideal for first-time Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and professionals who may not have legal or compliance backgrounds.\nThis course is highly relevant to SME owners, administrators, and operational leads in HR, IT, or compliance functions who have been tasked with ensuring their organisation’s compliance but lack formal training in data protection. It provides a clear starting point, actionable steps, and practical insights to navigate PDPA requirements with confidence.\nLearners will leave the course with clarity on what they need to do, how to prioritise their efforts, and how to communicate the importance of data protection across their organisation.",

Selbstverständlich gibt es unzählige weitere Formulierungen, die einem Mitarbeiter es für eine weitere Bewerbung schwer machen können.\nWichtig ist, dass ein Arbeitszeugnis laut Gesetz immer wohlwollend bzw. befriedigend geschrieben werden muss, damit der Mitarbeiter die Chance hat, wieder in die Arbeitswelt eintreten zu können.\nAllerdings gibt es mehrere Möglichkeiten, ein Arbeitszeugnis schlecht aussehen zu lassen. Zum Beispiel dann, wenn einige Informationen im Arbeitszeugnis einfach fehlen, oder mit kleinen Tricks manipuliert wird. So könnte ein Unternehmen einem Mitarbeiter zum Beispiel Schaden zufügen, wenn hinter der Unterschrift des Vorgesetzten noch ein oder zwei Punkte stehen.\n\n\nUnabhängig davon kann es natürlich auch sein, dass ein Vorgesetzter das Zeugnis vollkommen unbewusst negativ schreibt. Dies passiert hauptsächlich in kleineren Unternehmen. In diesem Fall sollte der Vorgesetzte darauf aufmerksam gemacht und um eine Änderung gebeten werden.\n\n\nIn diesem Kurs erfahren Sie, was ein gutes oder auch negative Arbeitszeugnis aus dem Personalwesen ausmacht, damit Sie entweder als Personalangestellter keine Fehler machen, oder als Bewerber wissen, worauf es bei einem guten Zeugnis ankommt.\n\n\nAls Personalbetriebswirt kenne ich hier die typischen Fälle, die Sie in diesem Online-Kurs lernen werden.\n\n\nInhalt\nWas gehört ins Arbeitszeugnis?\nWas gehört nicht ins Arbeitszeugnis?\nWas muss bei der Unterschrift beachtet werden?\nWie sind die Fristen bei Änderungen\nWas sagt der Austrittsgrund und das Datum aus?\nWas sind die geheimen Codes für schlechte Arbeitsleistung?\nInkl.

      "description": "Covers New Labour Laws and Statutory Compliances\nLaw has a very important role to play in what any HR manager does in a day, though it may not be always apparent. You actually require a good hold of different laws starting from the recruitment, to their onboarding, mandatory paper work, different benefits such as PF, ESI, bonus, gratuity etc.\nAlso you will need to ensure that the decision of dismissal is taken after proper disciplinary proceedings. If you do not follow proper procedures, the company may have to pay compensation for wrongful termination or reinstate the employee with back wages in some cases.\nIn fact, as you go up the chain, legal knowledge becomes indispensable. Let’s say you are drafting a leave policy for a company, and fail to check the relevant Shops and Establishments Act of the state, you will almost certainly get it wrong. The consequence can be paying heavy fines by the company if an inspector comes visiting, a potentially negative impact on the brand and embarrassment in front of other employees.\nAlso if you talk about different functions of HR such as Recruitment, Training and Development, Performance Appraisal, Grievance handling etc then you will notice that a part, small to big, is played by the respective managers as well. But labour laws are something which other people usually don’t have much of an idea and if you make this strong then this will give you a lot of importance and growth in that company.\n\n\nCode on Wages, 2019\nSection 1:\nSelf-Assessment\nImportance for HRs\nNew Codes\nCodes on Wages, 2019\nSection 2: Preliminary\nPreliminary\nFAQs\nSection 3: Minimum wages\nMinimum wages\nFAQs\nSection 4: Payment of Wages\nPayment of Wages\nFAQs\nSection 5: Payment of Bonus\nPayment of Bonus\nFAQs\nRecap",

      "description": "Course Overview: Preparing for the Independent Director Proficiency Test in India\n\n\nIntroduction\nCongratulations on taking a significant step towards becoming an Independent Director (ID) in a listed company in India. This course is designed to support your journey by offering a comprehensive mock test series aligned with the syllabus prescribed by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) for the mandatory online self-assessment proficiency test. Whether you're from a business or non-business background, this course may be the only preparation material you need to confidently attempt and clear the exam.\n\n\nWhy Become an Independent Director?\nThere is a growing demand in India’s corporate sector for qualified and experienced professionals to serve as Independent Directors. The role is prestigious and carries a high degree of responsibility, particularly in corporate governance, ethical oversight, and strategic decision-making.\nIn addition to financial remuneration through sitting fees and performance-based bonuses, Independent Directors benefit from:\nExposure to diverse sectors and industries\nOpportunities to work alongside senior leaders including Managing Directors and CEOs\nA platform for networking and continuous learning\nThe chance to make a meaningful contribution to corporate growth and shareholder value\n\n\nRegulatory Background: The Mandatory Proficiency Test\nIn October 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) made it mandatory for individuals aspiring to become Independent Directors to pass an online proficiency test conducted by the IICA.\nTo qualify, candidates must:\nRegister on the Independent Director Databank, created jointly by the MCA and IICA in December 2019.\nSuccessfully clear the online self-assessment proficiency test within two years of registration (certain exemptions apply as per MCA guidelines).\nThe test evaluates candidates on their understanding of corporate laws, board dynamics, and governance principles—ensuring only qualified individuals serve in this critical role.\n\n\nAbout This Course\nThis course comprises four full-length mock tests aimed at preparing candidates for the official proficiency test. It offers wide-ranging coverage of the syllabus, including:\nCompanies Act, 2013\nSecurities Laws (including SEBI Act, SEBI Regulations, SCRA, and Depositories Act)\nSecretarial Standards and Secretarial Audit\nBoard Composition and Functions\nCorporate Governance and Strategy\nFinancial Accounting (including balance sheets, P&L accounts, cash flow statements, and accounting standards)\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nEnterprise Risk Management\nCorporate Frauds and Case Studies\nThe course is particularly beneficial for those without a background in Chartered Accountancy, Company Secretaryship, or Law, including professionals from technology and engineering domains.\nWe recommend reading the Companies Act, 2013 before attempting the mock tests. The Act is freely available for download on the MCA website.\n\n\nExam Format and Preparation Strategy\nThe proficiency test conducted by IICA is not a time-bound competitive exam. It focuses on evaluating your understanding of fundamental concepts. In some questions, all options may appear correct, making conceptual clarity critical.\nThese mock tests are designed to:\nStrengthen your conceptual understanding\nBuild your confidence\nSharpen your analytical thinking\nImprove your chances of success in the final exam\n\n\nWho Should Enrol\nThis course is suitable for:\nAspiring Independent Directors aiming to serve on the board of listed companies in India\nProfessionals from non-legal and non-financial backgrounds\nIndividuals seeking a structured, practical approach to prepare for the IICA’s proficiency test\n\n\nIndependent Directors: Their Role and Importance\nIndependent Directors act as neutral, non-executive advisors on corporate boards. They are not involved in daily operations but offer an external perspective critical to ethical governance and balanced decision-making.\nSection 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines the criteria for independence, while Section 150 and corresponding rules empower IICA to maintain a databank of eligible candidates and oversee the proficiency test framework.\nAs per the law:\nEvery listed public company must appoint at least one-third of its board members as Independent Directors.\nIndependent Directors are appointed by companies from the databank of candidates who have passed the required test.\n\n\nPractice Test Coverage\nThe test series included in this course covers all key areas as per IICA’s prescribed syllabus:\nRole and Responsibilities of Independent Directors\nSecurities Laws and Regulations\nCompanies Act, 2013 and Rules\nSecretarial Standards\nCorporate Governance and Strategy\nFinancial Accountancy Fundamentals\nImportant Case Studies and Practical Scenarios\nThis approach ensures a well-rounded preparation experience.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe author assumes no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in this content.

      "description": "I made this course because, irrelevant of the fact that you are a crypto enthusiast of not, it looks like the majority of people already agreed to a Web3 metaverse future, therefore studying and adapting became a necessity, not an option.\nIn this course:\n- I define notions related to the Web3 economy such as, “metaverse”, “smart contract”, “DeFI” and many more;\n- I define the blockchain technology and provide a detailed picture of how blockchain transactions work;\n- I define cryptocurrency and crypto tokens and provide a lot of practical examples;\n- I provide a whole picture of the Web3 financial crime;\n- I provide an analysis of the money laundering risks for the crypto sector and the Web3 metaverse.\nLast, but not least, I added some written resources in which I go into more detail on the aspects presented in the videos. Make sure to check them, because I am much better at writing therefore you may find them useful.\nBecause I am currently a professional in the AML sector, I included a written, editable template for performing a crypto company risk assessment, which is in line with the European Banking Authority’s Guidelines for the crypto sector, issued in January this year. These guidelines will enter into force in December 2024, as part of a bigger package concerning AML and digital assets, and if you want to pursue a career in this field you should study them because they transpose the Financial Action Task Force guidelines and they seem to be trend setters in this sector.\nI hope you will find the information in this course helpful.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS:\nFind below my qualifications relevant for this field:\n\n\nCertificate: CS50’s Computer Science for Lawyers - issued by Harvard Online on November 2024\nCertificate: Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) Overview - issued by European Institute of Management and Finance (EIMF), on September 2024\nCertificate:  AML Foundations for Cryptoasset and Blockchain - issued by ACAMS, February 2024\nCourse: AML risk assessment – methodology - issued by the Romanian Banking Institute, April 2023\nCourse: KYC, AML/CFT and anti-fraud: strategy and planning - issued by the Romanian Banking Institute, October 2021\nGraduation of  The National Institute for professional training and improvement of lawyers of Romania - 2018\nMember of the Romanian Bucharest Bar - 2016\nMaster's degree in Business law - Law School, University of Bucharest, 2015 - 2016\nBachelor's degree in law - Law School, University of Bucharest, 2011 - 2015",

This includes simple contracts and formal contracts, express contracts and implied contracts, executed contracts and void contracts. We have also covered the first two elements of any valid contract. This includes the principles of offer, valid offers, revocation of offers etc. On the element of acceptance, we have included salient points of law on what amounts to an acceptance, for instance, counter-offers, cross-offers etc. and whether they amount to a valid acceptance. You will find several other principles. Bear in mind that we have discussed these in line with Nigerian law. We have taken the time to create an interlude for you by providing a bonus course which we believe will be very beneficial for both law students and non-law students. Public speaking is an essential skill which everyone should have; in the least, the barest minimum. If you are uninterested or are already a skilled public speaker, you may skip this section and proceed to company law practice.

Students will learn which business organization will help give them a tax advantage and how to limit liability. Nothing in this course creates an attorney client relationship and this information is intended to be educational and informational and does not constitute legal advice. This course was developed to better help students to understand how business law can affect their personal life and their pursuit of opening their own small business. This course will cover topics that will help future business owners to better understand what kind of business organization will both fit their goals and needs as future business owners. It will also help to introduce students to the type of unique language that they may run into when working with small businesses and small business owners. My goal is for all students to finish this course with a strong understanding of these basic principles and terminology so they may be better informed in the future for having conversations about their goals, plans, and dreams in the pursuit of opportunities in the business realm. Business law can affect numerous parts of a person's life and students are well prepared if they understand the various descriptors, language, and vocabulary associated with this topic.",

      "description": "Welcome to the \"Complete course on how to protect European trademarks\".\nThis advanced course will help you to learn how to protect European trademarks. The reason why these trademarks are so important is that they cover the territory of the entire European Union and all of its 27 Member States. This means that you don’t need to protect a trademark in every one of these countries but only register one EU trademark. In this way, you will save time and money.\nThe European trademark is a real advantage if you want to do business in the EU, a market that is considered to be one of the biggest in the world with a population of almost 500 million people and an annual GDP of 15 trillion dollars, representing around 1/6 of the global economy.\nOperating without a registered trademark in the EU could be risky because of the possible conflicts with already registered trademarks and the accompanying expensive and time-consuming legal proceedings.\nTHIS COURSE WILL GIVE YOU IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ABOUT THE WAY YOU CAN REGISTER EUROPEAN TRADEMARKS.\nYou will learn:\nTrademark definition.\nWhat European trademarks are?\nTypes and kinds of European trademarks.\nHow does this protection arise?\nWhat are the requirements for protection?\nHow to search for EU trademarks using the EUIPO TM database?\nHow and where you can apply for such trademarks?\nWhat is the registration process?\nFor how long will this protection be valid?\nWhat will cost you to register a European trademark?\nAnd some rules on how to maintain this protection in time.\nWhy choose this course?\nThis course will help you to understand what is a European trademark;\nYou will learn how to apply for an EU trademark and how much it will cost you;\nYou will learn what the registration process for European trademarks is and how to avoid some negative results like trademark refusals or oppositions;\nYou will learn how to maintain the protection of EU trademarks and how to avoid some pitfalls in that regard;\nYou will learn what are the ways to enforce European trademark rights in case of infringements in the EU;\nAs a bonus, I will also include a full PDF document that covers, in a systematic way, the basic information related to the protection of European trademarks as well as some resources and web addresses to the European Intellectual Property Office and handy tools that are helpful for the registration of trademarks.\nWhat makes me qualified to teach you?\nMy name is Ventislav or just Ventsi. I’ve been working in the field of intellectual property protection and management for more than 12 years. I’ve been involved in the registration of many European trademarks throughout the years working directly with the European Intellectual Property Office in Alicante, Spain. From that perspective, I’ve gained significant expertise and knowledge on how to deal successfully with the registration of such trademarks on the EU level.\nWhat Am I Going to Get From This Course?\n\nLifetime access to the course that covers the most essential aspects of registering European trademarks;\nInteractive screencast videos that give you a clear view of how to protect European trademarks;\nPractical tasks throughout the course will help you to put the knowledge that you will gain into practice;\nGuidance on common pitfalls and best practices regarding trademark registration in the European Union;\nDisclaimer:\nThe materials available in this course are for educational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice or opinion. You should contact an attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem. The aim of this course is to teach you how to register European trademarks, but not how to solve particular legal problems that can accompany this process; the latter requires in-depth legal knowledge and expertise.

Hier treffen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer aufeinander und haben unterschiedliche Vorstellungen, Erwartungen und Ansprüche von der Tätigkeit. Aber auch Kollegen und andere Mitarbeiter können für Konflikte sorgen.\nDabei existieren in der Arbeitswelt unterschiedliche Regeln, die den gemeinsamen Umgang und Konflikte bereits eindeutig klären. Ein breites Verständnis über das Arbeitsrecht hilft dabei, für die eigenen Rechte einzustehen und andere Mitarbeiter zu unterstützen. Wie viel Urlaubstage stehen mir zu? Darf mein Urlaub verweigert werden? Muss ich ständig Überstunden machen? Wie lange ist meine Kündigungsfrist? Führt die dritte Abmahnung wirklich zur Kündigung? Darf mein Arbeitgeber mich auf sozialen Medien stalken? Dies sind alles relevante Fragen im praktischen Arbeitsalltag, die durch das Arbeitsrecht eindeutig geklärt werden.\nDas Arbeitsrecht umfasst unterschiedliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Arbeitnehmer und Arbeitgeber. Dabei gelten die dort enthaltenen Rechte für beide Seiten und sind somit gegenseitige Verpflichtungen. Das Wissen über die eigenen Rechte und Regelungen sind wichtige Informationen, um Streitigkeiten mit Mut entgegentreten zu können.\nDabei steht vor allem der Arbeitnehmerschutz im Vordergrund des Arbeitsrechtes und beinhaltet Regelungen, Rechte und Pflichten.\nDieser Kurs gibt Dir ein weitreichendes Verständnis über relevante Themen des Arbeitsrechtes. Unter anderem werden in diesem Kurs folgende Themen behandelt:\n\n\nDefinition von Rechte und Arbeitsrecht\nGewaltenteilung\nQuellen von Arbeitsrecht\nNormenpyramide\nArbeitszeitgesetz\nAllgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz\nBundesurlaubsgesetz\nKündigung\nAbmahnung\nArbeitnehmerrechte und Privatsphäre\n\n\nNach diesem Kurs bist Du dementsprechend in der Lage in Konfliktsituationen rechtlich zu agieren und andere zu darin unterstützen.\nIch wünsche Dir bei diesem Kurs viel Spaß und Erfolg!",

These questions also encompass long scenarios that challenge your understanding and application of privacy management concepts in practical situations.\nAmong the topics covered in these practice tests, you'll encounter crucial areas such as privacy program governance and the operational lifecycle of data protection. The governance section delves into the roles and responsibilities of privacy professionals, ensuring you're well-versed in the leadership and oversight necessary for effective privacy program management. The operational lifecycle component, on the other hand, puts a spotlight on the practical aspects of implementing, maintaining, and measuring a privacy program.\nThe scenarios included in the tests are particularly beneficial as they place you in realistic situations that a privacy professional might face. These scenarios require not only knowledge recall but also the application of concepts to new and complex situations, which is a key skill assessed in the CIPM certification exam.\nWhether you're a seasoned privacy professional or new to the field, these practice tests are an invaluable resource to gauge your readiness for the CIPM exam and to fine-tune your understanding of the intricate world of information privacy management.",

Elle a été ré-écrite de manière plus générique pour s'adapter à différents processus et être indépendante des modèles de contrat utilisés. Elle est parfaitement utilisable pour former acheteurs et commerciaux et peut être insérée dans un processus de \"On-Boarding\" de ces fonctions.\n\n\nParce que je considère qu'un modèle de contrat doit être adapté à votre besoin, j'ai décidé de ne pas en fournir.

Isto porque, apenas ler a lei quase nunca é suficiente. Muitos são os desafios diários que enfrentamos em relação à materialização dos princípios de proteção de dados, mas o que separa o bom profissional de privacidade do mediano é ter a capacidade de inovação estratégica para lidar com as situações mais adversas que as empresas e os titulares se deparam.\n\n\nPara isso, é essencial compreender corretamente como devemos interpretar os pontos mais relevantes dessa legislação, de modo que o negócio não seja prejudicado, mas que o respeito pela lei também não seja ignorado. Assim, temos como objetivo mudar a sua percepção da LGPD que perpassa por uma ideia de apenas uma 'lei que devemos cumprir' para vê-la como uma oportunidade de agregar valor aos negócios, como também de conscientização global da importância de proteger as informações pessoais de todos nós.\n\nPortanto, durante a nossa jornada juntos, iremos compartilhar com vocês situações que já enfrentamos para que vocês compreendam o racional aplicado e possam replicar em situações similares em suas rotinas.",

You doubt anyone will ever read it but you know it’s necessary.\nSo do you really need to create a Terms and Conditions page for your website?\nPrivacy especially will be increasingly important over the next several years and entrepreneurs will increasingly find themselves liable for all kinds of things if it is not drafted correctly.\nYou can also save money on not having to hire a business lawyer. By taking this course, you don’t need to consult a business lawyer when you’re running a website.

It is vital to have your interests safeguarded, whether you require the services or are the one offering them, or if you are purchasing or selling goods. If you are starting a new business, it is probable that a third party will give you a contract and request that you sign it, placing you in a vulnerable position. If you don't have a legal background, you may be unaware of certain provisions that aren't in your best interest. Moreover, as a new business owner, you may not have sufficient funds to have the contract properly reviewed by a lawyer. Thus, it is critical to have a fundamental understanding of the law if you want to protect yourself and your business when signing contracts with third parties.\nIt is critical for independent freelancers and small business owners to have a basic legal awareness to safeguard themselves while signing contracts with third parties. Contracts are crucial for the provision of services and purchase or sale of goods. Both parties must have their interests safeguarded. This understanding is particularly significant for new business owners, who are especially vulnerable. If you lack legal experience, there is a risk that you may overlook provisions that are not in your best interests. Furthermore, new business owners are unlikely to have financial resources to hire a lawyer to review contracts. Therefore, developing fundamental legal knowledge is essential for protecting oneself and one's business.\nImportant: This course should not be considered as an alternative to professional legal advice since each case is unique and circumstances vary on a case by case basis.",

Thank You!”\nSteve Odlin\n“Where were you 10 years ago? This information is golden. Thank you so much for putting this together and making it accessible to everyone looking to grow their internet service business.”\nJoe Manga\n“I really Enjoyed the course.  It was more informative than I expected.  I picked up several things that we need to look into within our own contracts and proposals.”\nJason Champion",

      "description": "Contract management is the process of managing legally-binding agreements from initiation through to execution. Contract management activities include creation and negotiation, contract execution, contract compliance monitoring and renewal or close out.  We must understand clearly that, how your business manages its contract- from the systems it uses to how teams work together- will ultimately influence its levels of visibility, control and compliance. The strength of these pillars will determine your business's overall success- so your people, processes and technology need to be built with this in mind. Contract management is vital because how you handle your agreements end-to end will influence the outcomes of the agreements. Building standardized and collaborative contract management processes throughout your organization is vital because it gets all stakeholders working in the same way. Your business can expect to achieve its negotiated outcomes time and time again- as well as find opportunities to strengthen its position.\nUnderstanding the request phase during the contract stages is very important because stakeholders involved initiates the contract process. This is the first stage of the contract life cycle, which allows suppliers, customers, and partners to gather the essential details associated with any contract, amendment, renewal etc. Some software products allow teams to establish contract request forms that ensure all data is captured in a centralized place, which allows stakeholders to review and approve all the information requested in one single place. A breach of contract is a failure to do what one has agreed to do in a contract. A failure to perform duties in a contract is the triggering force behind many lawsuits. Common examples of breach of contract include a homeowner's failure to make a mortgage payment a caterer's failure to bring food to an event, or a celebrity's failure to show up at an event. All of the following steps must be prove to the court's satisfaction in order to win a breach of contract case.",

Are you confused or feel lost when listening to native English speakers discuss a certain legal issue or topic due to the complexity of the terminology?\nThis course is intended for anyone either studying law or working in some capacity in the field of law (and particularly for non-native English speakers). It introduces students (or provides a good review for those already with some knowledge) to key vocabulary, concepts, collocations and prepositions in some of the most important areas of law. It can also be a good introduction to the world of law for those with no legal background whatsoever (whether native or non-native English speakers).\nBy the end of the course, you should have the basics of the language in each of the areas of law covered to be able to understand and communicate with others smoothly and accurately.\nEach lesson is divided into 4 parts as follows: i) a video that introduces the student to the fundamental language in the field of law studied; ii) a video script for those who want to see all the contents in writing with key terminology highlighted in bold; iii) a series of questions that check the understanding of the contents of the video; iv) a “workbook” with practical exercises that make it necessary to use the fundamental concepts introduced through the video and finally v) answer key (found towards the end of the course).\nSome of the key areas of law covered include: Contracts; Business and Company; Property (both Intellectual and Real Estate); Legal Procedure (Civil and Criminal) and Litigation, among others. The course also includes several sessions on development of practical professional skills (in legal setting) such as email writing and negotiating.\nA final exam testing understanding of all areas of law covered is provided at the end of the course.\nCourse Outline:\nSection 1: Commercial Law I:\n* Contract Law: Intro to the language of Contracts; Contractual Remedies; legal referencing words & understanding clauses\nSection 2: Commercial Law II:\n* Business formation & restructuring and Property Law: Intro to the language of Business and Company Law; Mergers & Acquisitions; Property law: Real Estate and Intellectual Property (IP)\nSection 3: Most essential Non-Commercial Law:\n* Intro to the language of Tort law (Civil Responsibility), Criminal Law and Litigation (Court process)\nSection 4: Practical legal & professional skills:\n* Legal and professional writing and speaking: Linking (or connecting) words; email writing & meetings/negotiating\nFinal Exam and Answer Key (to all exercises included in the course) is found at the end of the course.",

Entretanto a chegada do coronavírus ao Brasil impôs grandes mudanças de planos, paralisando negócios e muitos setores da economia. Contrariando essa tendência, o ramo de imóveis vem mostrando resiliência com sinais de recuperação desde o fim do segundo trimestre do ano passado.\nAlém disso, os juros baixos facilitaram o lançamento de empreendimentos ao mesmo tempo em que atraíram compradores e investidores, que viram na aquisição de imóveis ou de fundos imobiliários uma opção com melhor rendimento e segurança do que outras modalidades de aplicação financeira.\nNo cenário microeconômico, a pandemia gerou um efeito sobre a moradia e a relação com a residência: ao praticar o isolamento social e ter que ficar mais tempo dentro de casa, muitas vezes trabalhando à distância, as pessoas passaram a valorizar diferentes atributos, que antes podiam ter menor importância.\nA transformação digital acelerada pela pandemia de coronavírus deve criar novas oportunidades para o setor de imóveis, impulsionando o surgimento de novas proptechs, as startups do mercado imobiliário.\nEntre os pontos que já eram utilizados antes desse cenário mas que se tornaram muito mais presentes, destaca-se o home office. Devido a essa alternativa oferecida pelas organizações, na qual muitas considerarão após a retomada da economia, diferentes regiões serão valorizadas, independentemente de estarem próximas ou não a locais em que estão situadas grandes grupos empresariais.\nEspaços para coworking em condomínios residenciais poderão ser vistos com mais frequência. Afinal, nem todo mundo se adapta na sua própria casa para que possa realizar as demandas do dia a dia, o que o leva a procurar por espaços que reproduzem o cenário de um escritório.\nOutros pontos que merecem atenção em relação ao mercado imobiliário, são:\nempreendimentos mais sustentáveis, uma vez que a pandemia trouxe uma realidade de crise financeira que levasse as pessoas a buscarem por economia de seus recursos;\ninvestimento em áreas verdes;\npossibilidade de oferecer alternativas virtuais para os clientes.\nEm relação ao último ponto, as empresas se viram obrigadas a adotarem um atendimento remoto, uma vez que não poderiam colocar em risco seus clientes e também seus profissionais. Nesse sentido, destaca-se as visitas virtuais e também o fechamento de contratos de forma totalmente online, o que modifica o modo como as imobiliárias vêm trabalhando até então.",

This is valid not only for identical trademarks but for similar ones too. In case such an event takes place the trademark infringer can face different legal challenges - and even lawsuits.\nTaking this into account and the fact that nowadays there are millions of registered trademarks around the world such negative outcomes cannot be ignored. One of the ways to stay on safe ground is always to run a trademark clearance search in advance, before launching your brand in the market.\nFrom that perspective, if you are a startup company, an entrepreneur, a marketing or brand-building specialist, a law attorney, a paralegal, a freelancer, or just a business owner who deals with brands, this course will be of great help to you.\nTHIS COURSE WILL GIVE YOU IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ABOUT THE WAY YOU CAN DO A TRADEMARK SEARCH by yourself using the official Patent Offices’ databases of\nthe United States of America (the videos cover the new version of the USPTO trademark database)\nCanada, the United Kingdom\nthe Republic of Ireland\nAustralia, and\nNew Zealand\nYou will learn how to implement a TESS search for trademarks in the USPTO database as well as in the equivalent database searching tools for the rest of the above-mentioned countries.\nKnowing how to deal with these trademark databases, which target some of the leading economies in the world, will provide you with an additional tool to build good and successful business and marketing strategies for your company.\n\n\nWhy should you select this course?\n\n\nIt will help you to build a strong brand name that can distinguish itself from already registered trademarks\nYou will be able to find out early registered trademarks that could represent obstacles to the registration of your own trademark before the Patent offices;\nSearching for registered trademarks can help you escape potential legal pitfalls or even lawsuits;\nYou will be able to check whether someone else tries to register a trademark that resembles your own;\nAcquiring skills to search for trademarks in official databases can save you money and time as well as give you a clearer view of the chances for your brand name to be registered.\n\n\nMost of the Patent Offices around the world register trademarks without any prior examination regarding earlier trademark rights. Even in the case of obtaining a trademark registration, this would be no guarantee that the trademark will not infringe on somebody else's rights. In light of this, a preliminary trademark search is critical.\nThe ability to conduct such searches throughout the brand-building process is useful because when you are aware of existing registered identical and similar signs you can easily make changes to your brand name in order to escape conflicts and to create a brand that will have better chances for registration as a trademark.\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to conduct your own trademark search successfully saving some time and money.\nAs a bonus, I will also include a full PDF document that covers, in a systematic way, web addresses to all Patent Offices’ databases as well as to all other tools and resources mentioned in the lectures, that you will need to do your own search.\n\n\nWhat makes me qualified to teach you?\n\n\nMy name is Ventislav or just Ventsi. I’ve been working in the field of intellectual property protection and management for more than 15 years. I’ve participated in many corporate projects for launching new brands in the market and the related process of their registration before the Patent Offices. In that regard, I’ve done many trademark clearance searches that targeted different countries around the world, including the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. From that perspective, I’ve gained significant expertise on how to deal successfully with such trademark searches and in that way to support the relevant brand building and the subsequent registration processes.\n\n\nWhat Am I Going to Get From This Course?\n\nLifetime access to the course which covers the most essential aspects of doing a trademark search.\nInteractive screencast videos that give you a clear view of how to implement a step-by-step trademark search.\nPractical tasks throughout the course will help you to put the knowledge that you will gain into practice.\nGuidance on common pitfalls and best practices regarding trademark search and how to extract the best results.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The materials available in this course are for educational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice or opinion. You should contact an attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem. The aim of this course is to teach you how to do a search for trademarks on your own, not how to assess trademarks' identity or similarity from a legal point of view. The latter requires in-depth legal knowledge and expertise which varies from country to country. The opinions expressed at or through this course are the opinions of the individual author only.

The course will be updated with new questions based on current trends in the privacy space.\nThe GDPR is an EU privacy regulation that was enacted on 25th May 2018 and applies directly to EU member states. It creates new obligations for data controllers and processors,  new data subject rights, the concepts of a one-stop shop and accountability.\nThe GDPR requires data controllers performing certain activities or a public authority to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO). DPOs help to show that a data controller is compliant with the GDPR.\nThe CIPP/E Certification is recognized in the privacy profession as an essential privacy certification. It shows that you not only understand the EU data protection laws and regulations but you also have the knowledge to help companies comply with the GDPR. The CIPP/E was recently updated and includes new content (Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence; Ethics related to AI; International Data Transfers; Consequences for GDPR Violations:Class Actions) that comprises 10% of the exam. Having the CIPP/E Certification also increases your chances of getting hired for a privacy role as employers prefer to hire professionals who are knowledgeable about privacy or data protection.\nNOTE: You will need to know the key GDPR components including the reasons for the enactment of the law, the scope of the law, the obligations of data controllers and processors, the DPO requirements and the fines for non-compliance before you enroll in the course.\n\n\nWho should Enroll in this Course:\nData Privacy Professionals preparing for the GDPR, DPO and CIPP/E Certification Exams\nPrivacy enthusiasts who would like to test their GDPR knowledge\n\n\nWhat is Included?\n3 Practice Exams (250 questions in total) which you can use to prepare for CIPP/E and GDPR certification exams e.g. DPO Training Exams. These questions are mostly scenario-based questions. Questions are mostly moderate to difficult level.\nInformation on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield invalidation (Please check the Educational Announcements)\nInformation on Transfer Impact Assessments (Please check the Educational Announcements)\nInformation on the New Standard Contractual Clauses (Please check the Educational Announcements)\nInformation on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Please check the Educational Announcements\nInformation on Ethics and Artificial Intelligence (Please check the Educational Announcements)\n\n\nSome examples of questions you will find on the practice tests:\nTom rents a condo which is part of a community association.\nThe community association installed video surveillance in Tom’s apartment building for the purpose of preventing theft and ensuring security. The use of the video surveillance for preventing theft was included in the tenant agreement that Tom signed. Individuals who have any complaints are requested to email the community association secretary.\nThe Tenant Association also created an application to make it possible for video surveillance images to be accessed remotely through the internet. Anyone online can access the video surveillance images from the community association’s website.\nA member of the community association extracted an image of Tom walking his dog from its video surveillance system, and then posted the image on the community association marketing materials and the community association website.\nThe image of Tom and his dog drives more web traffic to the association’s website.\nWhen Tom discovers that his image is on the community association marketing materials and the community website. He is so livid that he sends an email to the President of the association requesting the deletion of his image. The President ignores the request as the community association has been receiving great reviews of the marketing materials both online and offline. The community association continues to use the image of Tom and his dog for two months and then deletes it.\n\n\nWhat is true about the community association’s processing of Tom’s image?\nThe community association did not violate the GDPR as Tom was aware that the community association had installed video surveillance on the premise\nThe community association did not violate the GDPR as Tom signed a tenant agreement that disclosed the video surveillance in the apartment building\nThe community association had no legal basis to process the image of Tom and his dog\nThe community association is not responsible for the actions of its employee\n\n\nWhich is an example of a sub-processor?\nA company that hires a marketing firm to help market the company's goods and services\nA cloud provider that stores customer information for a regional company\nA company that decides to enter into an agreement with a regional company to host a promotional event\nAn email marketing platform that is procured by a marketing firm to promote products on behalf of a multinational organization",

      "description": "Overview. This skills course describes the important role of technology, applications, and software in the efficient operation of a law office or law department. It also illustrates how the right approach to these legal tech tools can enable paralegals, lawyers, law clerks, legal interns, legal assistants, and others to optimize their use of time, complete tasks and matters faster, and successfully manage busy case loads and matter dockets. This is not a software development course and is focused on paralegal and related students and occupations.\nIt is not intended to be a step-by-step tutorial, however it includes comprehensive overview on legal technologies and apps along with examples, illustrations, and tips for improving or charting out a plan for learning more.\nEffective Approach to Legal Tech. The course starts by describing the purpose of legal technology from the core software that is used by nearly everyone to the more specialized apps and tools used by different practice areas. Importantly, it provides the student a valuable way to think about and approach technology as an indispensable tool for efficiency and for personal effectiveness. It also briefly discusses some of the ethical considerations unique to the use of software and applications in the legal setting. Categories of legal tech and apps covered include: word processing and office applications, law practice management, time and billing, document management, document assembly and automation, communication and collaboration apps, legal research web-apps, and next generation legal tech tools such as knowledge management systems, legal quality assurance, process automation, and others.\nOverview of Important Application Types. Importantly, while the course spotlights some specific advanced tools in word processing and other core software that can be useful for most law offices and legal departments, it is not taught as a step-by-step tutorial for specific applications. This is because each specific practice setting and law firm will have its own mix of unique software. The course does provide a good overview of the major classes of software and applications, describing their general purpose, illustrating how they improve efficiency in the law office and help make paralegals more effective. Students can use the exercises and handouts to map out their own plan for further learning of specific applications that are relevant to their position or area of focus.\nConcise and Practical Skills Course. The course includes extensive lecture and visual materials; however, it is not intended to substitute for post-secondary instruction in legal research and writing for paralegals. This course is also not intended to be continuing education and is not qualified for such credit in any jurisdiction. The course focuses on paralegals in the U.S. and is intended to be a highly practical skill building overview useful both to paralegals in training who want to supplement their formal studies or current paralegals who want to sharpen everyday skills to help them improve performance on the job.\nAdvanced Technologies, Data Analytics, and the Future. We also briefly explore the potential role of the latest and most advanced technologies and how leveraging them can help optimize our approach to case work, priorities, drafting, and potentially bring more job satisfaction for paralegals and attorneys. This inclusion discussion on automation and related technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe lessons focus on the United States (US) legal system and are taught primarily in English. The course may also be applicable to other common law legal systems (e.g., India, United Kingdom - UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia).",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course is beneficial to paralegals in training as well as currently qualified paralegals who want a refresher or to sharpen their skills.",
        "This course is not for continuing paralegal credits and is not intended to substitute for an approved paralegal training program. It is important that all students research and understand the requirements of the state in which they plan to work as a paralegal and discuss qualifications with their prospective supervising attorney under whose specific direction they will work.",
        "This course can be useful as part of orientation or on-boarding of new paralegals to law offices or in-house legal departments.",
        "This course can also be useful to law clerks, legal interns, and lawyers who need a primer on legaltech and law software"

A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter and nanomaterials are typically one to 100 nanometers in diameter. But because of this nano-size, the characteristics and properties change so dramatically, that in addition to the new applications, they pose new risks as well as opportunities for society.",

      "description": "GDPR e SICUREZZA INFORMATICA sono due facce della stessa medaglia.\nLa GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) definisce \"cosa si deve fare\" mentre la SICUREZZA INFORMATICA indica \"come bisogna fare\"\n\nSi parte da due diversi punti di osservazione per giungere allo stesso obiettivo (la protezione dei dati).\n\nCon la GDPR si affronta la problema dall'aspetto normativo stabilendo le linee di principio delle condotte da osservare, il metodo, l' approccio e il perimetro dei comportamenti legittimi.\nCon la SICUREZZA INFORMATICA si trasforma il tutto in azioni pratiche, proporzionate al contesto dell'azienda.\n\nInsieme al mio amico Giuseppe Izzinosa (esperto di GDPR) abbiamo deciso di affrontare le tematiche dai due diversi punti d'osservazione per offrire una visione completa della problematica, affrontando ciascuna tematica con la tipica pragmaticità di chi quotidianamente deve entrare nel merito delle problematiche per risolvere problemi e dare risposte risolutive:\n- COSA FARE\n- COME FARLO\n- PERCHE' FARLO\n\nApprofondiremo argomenti e soluzioni in materia di GDPR, (General Data Protection Regulation,  il regolamento europeo su privacy e dati che è diventato operativo dal 2018) associando, ad ogni passo, gli elementi informatici corrispondenti.\n\n\nQuesta normativa infatti prevede che, in base alle caratteristiche della struttura, l’integrità dei dati venga sempre garantita controllandone l’accesso e tracciandone eventuali modifiche, specificando tutti gli eventuali trattamenti a cui i dati sono sottoposti.\nPartendo da questa semplificazione (mi perdonino i più edotti della materia) possiamo tracciare un percorso anche attraverso il mondo informatico.\nPer controllare l’accesso, devo sapere con esattezza chi accede al dato. Se, dal punto di vista fisico, questo è traducibile con un’espressione retorica molto comune come “mettere materialmente mano su qualcosa”, dal punto di vista digitale, la problematica diventa invece molto più complessa.\nUna delle peculiarità del mondo digitale è infatti quella di rendere i dati accessibili anche se esiste una distanza fisica di metri o di km, venendo quindi meno tutte le limitazioni (peculiari) della fisicità (controllo fisico).\n\n\nPer agevolare la mia spiegazione con un esempio, se per controllare l’accesso ai dati contenuti in un PC basterebbe mettere sotto chiave la stanza e fare entrare solo una persona alla volta, ovvero chi detiene la chiave, per i dati conservati in un PC collegato a internet non basterà più mettere sotto chiave la stanza ma bisognerà anche mettere in piedi gli opportuni controlli per verificare che nessuno riesca ad accedere ai dati attraverso la porta d’accesso messa a disposizione dal collegamento internet.\nLaddove nella stanza i PC dovessero essere più di uno, la stessa verifica (valida per internet) dovrà essere allargata anche agli ulteriori PC presenti nella stanza.\nÈ quindi evidente che, di volta in volta, si dovranno mettere in campo tutta una serie di protezioni (che approfondiremo nel corso) che, in base al contesto, siano in grado di garantire l’integrità del dato e il relativo tracciamento delle modifiche.\nSeguendo le indicazioni di questo corso, metterete in pratica tutte le indicazioni di sicurezza idonee al Vostro contesto e di riflesso Vi troverete ad aver rispettato i fondamenti del principio che riguarda l’integrità dei dati, il che vi allineerà automaticamente ai principali dettami della normativa GDPR.",

It may be performed to assess strength of a patent for the purpose of valuation and licensing. Generally, the deliverables for a Validity/Invalidity search consist of a search report, a claim mapping chart, and citation of prior art.

This involves a thorough review of my law school notes, outlines, and supplementary materials.\nActive Learning Techniques: I'm actively engaging with the material through various methods, including creating flashcards, summarizing key concepts, and teaching the material to others. This helps solidify my understanding and improve retention.\nPractice, Practice, Practice: Consistent practice is crucial for MBE success. I'm dedicating significant time to answering practice questions, both individually and in timed simulated exam settings. This allows me to familiarize myself with the format, identify my strengths and weaknesses, and refine my test-taking strategies.\nTargeted Weaknesses: Through practice and self-assessment, I'm pinpointing areas where I need to focus my efforts. I'm revisiting challenging topics, seeking clarification on confusing concepts, and reinforcing my understanding through targeted practice.\nMindfulness and Well-being: I recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between intense study and self-care. I'm incorporating mindfulness practices, exercise, and adequate rest into my routine to manage stress and optimize my cognitive performance.\nDisclaimer:\nWhile I strive for accuracy in my preparation, it's important to acknowledge that I am an AI language model and not a licensed attorney or legal professional. The information I provide should not be considered official legal advice or a substitute for guidance from qualified legal experts. It's crucial to consult official bar exam resources and seek advice from licensed professionals for any specific legal concerns or questions.\nMy goal is to approach the MBE with confidence and demonstrate my competency in legal analysis and application.

Starting from when the confict begins, before a case is filed, even before hiring an attorney. In fact, the largest section of the course is the plan for hiring the right attorney, if you need one.\nThe course is instructed by David Pelligrinelli, a licensed private investigator, certified civil court mediator, surety bond agent, and licensed commercial lines insurance producer. In addition, he has appeared in court many times as a certifed expert witness for the United States Department of Justice.\nThe course curriculum comes from participating in hundreds of trials as an investigator or advisor.\nCivil court cases are won or lost on strategy more than court procudure. A party to a court case that brings the best strategy is more likely to prevail, and bring the highest judgment award. The attorney will bring the procedural knowledge, and you as the party to the case knows the facts, but without a professinal strategy in place those can be overcome by the other party.\nYou will learn strategy on how to prepare your claims for maxium recovery, how to discover other third parties who may have additional liability, how to look for concealed records that could destroy the other parties arguments, and how to seize hidden assets for judgment recovery.\nWhile many attorneys might push for a negotiated settlement, the course will teach an alternate method to collect a judgment earlier with less expense, and allowing you to obtain other records.\nFor those litigants who have already experienced difficulty in engaging a good lawyer, the course goes into detail of the \"15:4:1\" process to get the best lawyer to ask YOU for the case.\nThis course is not intended to provide legal representation or legal advice.",

Was steht da eigentlich drin? So viele Regelungen, das ist doch verwirrend!\nDas ist typisch und nicht unüblich, kann ich angesichts der vielen Vorschriften auch verstehen.\nAber Sie müssen verstehen: um alle Selbstständigen und ihre Bedürfnisse z.B. nach Haftungsbeschränkung ordnungsgemäß und einheitlich einzuordnen, gibt es in allen Rechtsordnungen verschiedenen Rechtsformen, mit denen man Ihre Art der Betriebstätigkeit beschreibt – mehr ist das nicht!\nSie müssen sich das wir bei dem Kauf von Arbeitskleidung vorstellen: Damit Sie den passenden „Anzug“, die richtige „Form“ für Ihre Tätigkeit bekommen, müssen Sie sich über bestimmte Fragen im Klaren werden:\nWelche Rechtsform passt zu Ihrer Ausgangslage und Ihren Motiven?\nWelche Schritte geht man üblicherweise, wenn man die richtige Rechtsform finden will?\nWelche Rechtsformen gibt es überhaupt, aus denen Sie auswählen könnten?\nWelche Kriterien der Rechtsformwahl sind begrifflich zu unterscheiden?\nIn welchen Vorschriften und Gesellschaftsverträgen steht was geschrieben?\nWie unterscheidet man Personen- von Kapitalgesellschaften?\nWas kostet mich die Rechtsform und wie lange dauert die Gründung?\nWas darf ich in einem Gesellschaftsvertrag nicht vergessen zu regeln?\nWie sehen Muster von Gesellschaftsverträgen und Geschäftsführerverträgen aus?\nAlle diese Fragen haben schon viele Unternehmen bestens gemeistert!\nDas schaffen Sie auch! Ich zeige Ihnen hier, wie es geht!\n2\nDie Lösung\nGehören Sie zu denjenigen, die am liebsten keine Vorgaben sich von den Juristen machen lassen – freies Leben auch mit der Rechtsform? Haben Sie auch gute Lösungsideen, wie Sie die vorliegende Frage der Rechtsformwahl einfach \"umgehen\" können?\nDann sind Sie nicht allein, wie dieser interessante und gleichzeitig kuriose Fall des BGH vom 27.09.1999 - II ZR 371/98 zeigt:\nDa haben sich mit Gesellschaftsvertrag vom 09.05.1994 drei Gesellschafter, später Beklagte, zum Zwecke des gemeinsamen Betriebs einer Deponie- und Bauschuttrecyclinganlage und der Vermarktung von Recycling-Baustoffen zusammengeschlossen. Da ihnen die Haftungsbeschränkung wichtig war, nannten sie ihren Betrieb einfach so: \"Deponie und Bauschuttrecycling Neupoderschau, Bauschutt - Beton - Stahlbeton Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts mit beschränkter Haftung\".\nDann kam es wie es kommen musste: Die Firma wurde aufgelöst und die Gläubigerin K GmbH, die den drei Beklagten eine Betonbrecheranlage vermietet hatte, verlangte die ausstehende Miete in Höhe von 17.270 DM hierfür von den drei Ex-Gesellschaftern aus deren Privatvermögen.\nDiese sagten natürlich, sie hätten doch die Haftung auf das nun nicht mehr vorhandene Vermögen der GbR beschränkt gehabt, weil\nder Name ja schon die Haftungsbeschränkung enthielt,\nder Mietvertrag mit Stempelaufdruck \"Bauschutt Recycling Neupoderschau GbR mbH\" versehen worden war\ndie K-GmbH ja auch selbst in ihren Anschreiben an die Mieter immer von der \"GbR mbH M + B + L\" (Nachnamen der Bekl.) gesprochen hätte\nim Gesellschaftsvertrag die Haftung auf das Gesellschaftsvermögen beschränkt gewesen war, vgl. § 7 Abs. 1 des Gesellschaftsvertrages\nim Gesellschaftsvertag die Vertretungsmacht der Gesellschafter auf das Vermögen der Gesellschaft und nicht auf das Privatvermögen der Gesellschafter beschränkt gewesen war.\nWas glauben Sie ist bei der Klage der Vermieterin gegen die „Gbr mbH“ bzw. deren 3 Ex-Gesellschafter herausgekommen?\nNichts Gutes! Sie werden sehen! Im Gesellschaftsrecht herrscht nun Mal \"Rechtsformzwang\"!\nLassen Sie uns deshalb hier gemeinsam das Thema Rechtsformwahl Mal richtig strukturiert ansehen, denn ich habe es selbst in vielen Jahren\nals Anwalt, Rechtsberater, Jurist beraten\nund bei meiner eigenen Existenzgründung praktiziert und\nmöchte mit Ihnen meine Erfahrungen, Tipps und Lösungen teilen.\nDabei werden wir wie Folgend vorgehen, damit Sie für sich eine Lösung finden:\nAusgangssituation und wichtige Kriterien analysieren (Tipps 1 bis 2)\nKlären, ob Sie alleine bleiben wollen oder mit anderen zusammen arbeiten müssen/wollen (Tipp 3)\nAlternativen der Rechtsformen kennen lernen (Tipp 4)\nGründungsanforderungen sowie Vor- und Nachteile der einzelnen Rechtsformen kennen lernen (Tipps 5 bis 10)",

Es el tratado normativo más importante en relación al Derecho Público Internacional Aeronáutico.\nEn 1944, con el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial próximo, Estados Unidos promovió una conferencia con el fin de actualizar los acuerdos internacionales sobre aviación civil, estancados prácticamente desde la Convención de París de 1919. La conferencia se celebró en Chicago del 1 de noviembre hasta el 7 de diciembre de 1944, con asistencia de delegados de 52 Estados. En ese momento, la aviación civil estaba esperando el final de la guerra para su relanzamiento, se habían logrado grandes avances tecnológicos en la aeronáutica, el potencial económico de EE. UU. estaba en pleno auge, mientras que las grandes potencias europeas, la URSS y Japón estaban totalmente endeudadas, con una industria aeronáutica civil prácticamente destruida. Esto trajo un enfrentamiento entre EE. UU., con una posición económicamente muy fuerte que pretendía una política de libre mercado aéreo internacional, frente al resto de los países, que querían adoptar una política proteccionista para reconstruir sus industrias aeronáuticas y sus economías.",

      "description": "民法の事例問題で行き詰まっているあなたへ\n3ステップで民法の事例問題をクリア！今までにない解法で、あなたも合格圏内へ！\n\n\nこのコースは\n・民法が苦手な方\n・民法の点数を伸ばしたい方\n・法律とは無縁の仕事だが、行政書士試験に合格したい方\n・法律初学者の方\n\n\n上記の方を対象に作成しました。\n民法の事例問題が解けなくて苦手科目になっている方へおすすめするコースです。\n\n\n\n\n民法が解けないと下記のような問題が起こります\n\n\n・民法が解けないと点数が取れず、合格が遠のく\n行政書士試験に合格する為には民法の5肢択一式を9問中最低6～7問は確実に正解する必要があります。\nさらに記述式でも2問合わせて30点以上を取りたいところです。\n\n\nしかし事例問題ができないと6～7問を正解することはできません。\n記述式も2問合わせて30点以上取るのは厳しいです。\nなぜなら民法の問題のほとんどは事例問題で出題されるからです。\n\n\n・条文や判例の理解が浅くなり、応用問題が解けない\n行政書士試験の民法は、条文や判例をただ暗記するだけではなく、応用問題も含まれます。\n解き方を学ばないと、出題の意図や問題の核心が理解できず、得点が伸び悩みます。\n\n\n・他の科目にも影響が出る\n行政書士試験では法律の総合的な理解が求められるため、民法の理解が曖昧だと、\n行政法や商法など他の法律科目の問題にも影響が出ます。\n特に法律の横断的な知識が必要な問題では、民法の知識が不足していると解答が難しくなります\n\n\nこれらの問題を回避するためにも、早期に民法の解き方を学び、練習を重ねることが必要です。\n\n\n\n\n事例問題の重要性\n行政書士試験に合格する為には民法の5肢択一式を9問中最低6～7問は確実に正解する必要があります。\nさらに記述式でも2問合わせて30点以上を取りたいところです。\n\n\nしかし事例問題ができないと6～7問を正解することはできません。\n記述式も2問合わせて30点以上取るのは厳しいです。\n\n\nなぜなら民法の問題のほとんどは事例問題で出題されるからです。\nですので事例問題は重要なポイントになります。\n\n\n\n\n事例問題は解くのが難しい\n事例問題とは法律に関しての事件が問題形式で問われたものです。\n事件を見てどんな法的主張ができるのか考えなくてはなりません。\n\n\n民法の条文をいくら記憶しても、\n事例問題を見てどんな法的主張ができるのかわからなければ、条文を使えないので解くことができません。\nそこが事例問題の難しい所です。\n\n\n行政書士試験に合格するには？\n行政書士試験は年に1回の1発勝負です。\n安定して正確に解くスキルを持っていないと合格に何年もかかってしまいます。\n\n\n民法は合格点の180点中76点を占めており、3分の1以上の割合となっています。\nですので事例問題を正確に解けるようにして6～7問の正解と\n記述式で2問合わせて30点以上を目指す事ができれば1発合格も可能です。\n\n\n\n\n誰でも実現可能なノウハウ\n私は工場のライン作業者でその日暮らし、法律とは無縁で何も取り柄がない人間でした。\nですが自分の人生を変えたいと思い勉強を始めました。\n\n\n初めは民法の事例問題が全く解けず、民法が嫌いでした。\nとにかくテキストを見ながらひたすら問題を解き続けたのですが、理解できず挫折しそうでした。\nそこで、何が原因で解けないのか考えることにしました。\n\n\n原因は3つのポイントがきちんとできていなかったためでした。\n3つのポイントの1つでも欠けると知識をうまく引き出すことができません。\n3つのポイントを押さえる事で正確に解けるようになり、民法を得点源にして合格できました。\n\n\nそして事例問題を解けるようになることで法律的な思考ができるようになり、\n行政書士になった現在も法律的な思考は役に立っています。\n\n\n私のように工場のライン作業者でその日暮らし、法律とは無縁、何の取り柄もない人間でも\nこの方法で正確に事例問題を解けるようになりました。\nですので誰でも実現可能なはずです。\n\n\n\n\nコースの3つの特徴\n1.複雑な法律事例を明確で簡単な3つのステップに分解し、学習します。\n各ステップは、事例問題のアプローチ方法を体系的に理解し、実践するためのものです。\nこれにより、誰でも効率的に問題解決能力を高めることができます。\n\n\n2.暗記や一般的な問題解決法とは一線を画し、\n具体的な事例問題に対する新しい視点とアプローチ法を提供します。\n相関図の作成、法律構成、要件の検討など、実用的なスキルを身につけ、\n試験だけでなく実務においても法律的思考能力を強化します。\n\n\n3.コース内容は、実際に行政書士試験で出題されるような事例問題に焦点を当てています。\n相関図の書き方から法律構成の方法、要件を検討するプロセスまで、すべて具体的な例を用いて解説します。\nまた、補助教材として提供される過去問題と3ステップシートを活用し、習得した知識を実践的に適用することが可能です。\n\n\n\n\nコースを受講するメリット\n・5肢択一式を9問中6～7問の正解と記述式でも2問合わせて30点以上を目指せる\n・民法を得点源にできるので行政書士試験の合格に近づける\n・法律的な考えができるようになるので開業してからも役立つ\n上記のようなメリットがあります。\n\n\n3ステップを使い事例問題解けるようになり、行政書士試験合格への道を切り開いてください。\n法律に関する深い理解と実践的な解決能力を手に入れることができます。\n\n\n\n\n民法の解き方をマスターせずに先延ばしにすると\n民法の得点が不足し、たとえ他の科目である程度点数を稼げても、合計点が合格ラインに達しない可能性が高まります。\n民法は基本科目であり、応用力が問われるため、解き方を理解せずに挑むのはリスクが大きいです。\n\n\n民法は基礎科目であると同時に、得点源となる科目でもあります。\n解き方を早期に身につけ、安定した得点を取れるようにすることが、合格への最短ルートです。\n\n\n\n\nUdemyではコースを30日以内に返金できるようにしています。\nコースに満足いただけない場合は、その理由を問わず、返金ポリシーのガイドラインに従って返金を申請できます。\nですのでリスクはなく、安心して受講できます。\n\n\n今すぐコースに登録し、民法の事例問題を簡単に解けるようになる第一歩を踏み出してみてください。",

It incorporates international best practices based on models suggested by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The powers and jurisdiction of Company Law Board, Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction and High Court in this regard, is being exercised by National Company Law Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal. The purpose of creation of the Tribunal is to avoid multiplicity of litigation before various courts or quasi-judicial bodies or forums regarding revival or rehabilitation or merger and amalgamation, and winding up of companies.\nThe objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner. An effective legal framework for timely resolution of insolvency and bankruptcy will not only encourage entrepreneurship but will also improve Ease of Doing Business, and facilitate more investments leading to higher economic growth and development.\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 consolidates the existing framework by creating a single law for insolvency and bankruptcy. The Code applies to companies, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, individuals and any other body which the central government may specify.",

      "description": "Contracts, Criminal Laws, and Torts Law\nFor many students, the first year of law school is the most difficult. After completing this course, you will have developed a rudimentary understanding of contracts, criminal law, and the law of torts. After the first year, you will have become adept at being a law student and you will have a much more thorough understanding of the type of studying required. You'll also find yourself thinking more like a lawyer than a trivia contestant on a game show., as you will come to realize a system that ties it all together.\nYou will come to understand that a contract is formed when the parties to the agreement can contract, an offer is made, and that offer is certain, definite, unambiguous, and demonstrates to a reasonable person that an offer is being made.\nThat offer must be accepted in a timely and authorized manner. An acceptance must be unequivocal and mirror back the same terms.\nThere must also be a meeting of the minds, a mutuality of accent. Each party must have the same understanding of the terms of the contract.\nThere must also be a quid pro quo – something for something of value bargained for and given in exchange. This is known as consideration.\nAfter that, it’s a matter of understanding any remedies that may be available in the event of a breach of the contract.\nCriminal Law involves the evolution of major felonies such as the seven-enumerated felonies at common law and their progression to definitions laid out in the Model Penal Code. Criminal Law involves memorizing definitions of crimes, including the elements that must be met for a conviction. Conversely, you will also become familiar with common criminal defenses to crimes.\nIn Torts law, you will become familiar with intentional torts and their relationship to criminal and wrongful acts and the remedies thereof. You will also learn about negligence and the elements of negligence, eg, the breach of a duty not to expose others to an unreasonable risk of harm, and that the actions were both the direct and proximate cause resulting in ascertainable damages.\nA textbook covering all of the first-year courses is available online at Barnes and Noble. Enter my name, Shane Irvine, as the publisher, and you can find The Executive Juris Doctor  - ISBN#  979-8-891-45669-3.",

In this course, we’ll dive into the murky world of money laundering and terror financing (don’t worry, it’s all above board). Whether you’re a finance newbie, a legal eagle, or just someone with a Netflix crime doc addiction, this course is for you.\nYou’ll uncover the secrets of spotting suspicious transactions, wielding compliance tools like a pro, and even learn how to freeze and seize funds faster than you can say “financial irregularities.”\nPacked with practical insights, real-world scenarios, and the occasional bad pun, this course makes understanding Federal Decree-Law No. 20 of 2018 and its Implementing Regulations not just manageable—but dare we say—fun. No jargon. No stress. Just you, leveling up your AML/CFT game.\nThis is a self paced course, which means, you guys are free to watch and learn as and when you find time.

Unfortunately, many applications became “abandoned” because entrepreneurs did not understand the legal jargon of the federal trademark application process.\n\n\nThis experience empowered me to create a fully comprehensive course on applying for and registering trademarks.\n\n\nWhile in law school, I founded the Georgetown Law Entrepreneurship Club. My passion is helping entrepreneurs succeed, and explaining the law in a clear and approachable manner that empowers them to fully understand Intellectual Property and business law. We help to make the legal easy so that entrepreneurs can focus on building their brands.\n\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n\n\n17 lectures on understanding the fundamentals of trademarks\n12 lectures of Step-by-Step Guidance on Submitting Your Trademark to the USPTO\nFree Trademark Infringement Cease and Desist Template\nEducational handouts, including how to avoid common trademark mistakes and cease and desist tips.\nAn up-to-date course (2024) created by a former USPTO Trademarks Attorney and Georgetown Law graduate.\nDisclaimer: This course is for educational purposes only, and does not constitute legal advice.",

As the European Union takes significant steps to regulate AI, understanding these restrictions is essential for anyone involved in AI development, implementation, or compliance. This course breaks down each prohibition, detailing its purpose, application, and potential implications.\nWe begin with an exploration of manipulative techniques and the risks of exploiting individuals' vulnerabilities. You'll learn how these methods can unfairly influence people and why such approaches are deemed unacceptable in the EU. From there, we examine biometric categorization, social scoring, and other classifications, discussing their potential for societal harm and privacy breaches. Key topics also include strict limitations on real-time biometric identification and the use of facial recognition databases, where you’ll understand why and how these are restricted to protect individual freedoms and privacy.\nAdditional sections cover the assessment of high-risk AI applications and the emerging restrictions on emotion inference. By the end of the course, we recap the essential prohibitions and outline the penalties for non-compliance, helping you grasp the full scope of the AI Act’s implications. This course is ideal for AI developers, business leaders, and compliance officers looking to stay informed and align with the latest in EU regulations, ensuring ethical and lawful AI practices.",

For example, manufacturers need to buy raw materials to make their products; then they sell those products to wholesalers and/or retailers who then ultimately sell them to us as consumers. Whilst we ourselves may not always think about the legal consequences of what we are doing until something goes wrong (e.g., the holiday we booked turns out to be a disaster), many businesses employ a resolute contracts manager. When something does go wrong (e.g., goods supplied are defective) the first thing to consider is whether there was a contract and, if so, on what terms.\nThis course aims to provide learners with knowledge and understanding of distinct aspects and general principles of English Contract Law. Thus, we aim to give you a good overview of the requirements for the formation of contract, consideration, intention to create legal relations, formal requirements, terms, exclusion clauses and unfair terms, damages, and other remedies. This subject develops the idea of consensus, the rules and principles governing enforceability, performance, and discharge of contracts. Learners are introduced to common law and equitable principles as well as relevant legislation. After completing this course, you should be able to:\n\n\n1- Define and explain the main principles of contract law.\n2- Demonstrate an awareness of the effectiveness of the principles of the Law of Contract in modern society.\n3- Critically evaluate contemporary issues in contract law.\n4- Select and apply principles of the Law of Contract and reach logical and well-reasoned solutions.\n\n\nAs Mahatma Gandhi once said, \"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever\".",

I have taught lawyers at Google, Apple, Cisco, Bloomsbury Law, Richemont, Goldman Sachs, Baker McKenzie and Ashurst among many other organisations about how to read, understand draft clear contracts that are watertight and effective.\nYou'll learn key contractual concepts including offer and acceptance, terms (the contents of contracts) and remedies (how to resolve problems with contracts). This course consists of video lessons which aim to explain the key areas of contract law. The course is primarily based on the common law of England and Wales.\nThanks to my twenty years of experience working with over 10,000 lawyers and law students from around the world, I have the skills to help you to become a better contract draughtsman and improve your legal English.\nThis class is aimed at people who wish to become better at understanding contracts and how they are put together.\nThis course will also be of value to students of Legal English and Business English who would like to improve their vocabulary and comprehension of the language.\nNothing can replace the value of working with me one-to-one, but I hope that this series of classes goes some way to helping you to engage more fully with the language of contract law and negotiation.\nOur main focus is to learn how to practically draft commercial contracts in plain English. Your course will be divided as follows:\n\n\nIn our first part we will learn about the language of contract law.\nOur second series of lessons we will explore how contracts are formed.\nThe third section will look at key contract clauses and their purpose.\nIn the fourth set of classes, learn how about negotiating skills and phrases.\nIn part five, look at some key contract clauses and how to word them correctly.",

It is academic type lectures, using my PowerPoint slides, my research, my brain, my skills (such as they are). There are no fancy graphics and no fancy video editing. It is not entertainment and you will need an attention span of at least ten minutes. Consider your personal preferences, and see a few sample videos before you decide if this is right for you. If you have a problem or need something, message me.\nWhy this course? I have learned about cyberlaw over the years. First prosecuting cybercrime, then in private practice. I teach students and professionals about law, technology, cybersecurity, cybercrime, and privacy. I've written books on the topic. It was time to share these materials with a broader audience and I already have other courses on Udemy.\nI just built out a fuller course to align with my book on cyberlaw. But some learners need and appreciate a free resource, so this is it. This free course cannot exceed two hours, and that means I can only cover a certain amount of material.\nHere is the outline (don't forget to download the handout with lecture 1 and see my resources webpage).\nCourse Introduction\nIntroduction to law\nEntering the digital domain of cyberspace\nCriminal cyberlaw\nCivil law I, Traditional areas of civil law applied to cyberspace\nCivil law II, Data law\nInternational cyber conflict\nSpeech online\nOrganization management and compliance with cyberlaw\nConclusion and thank you\nLaw is for everyone and that means cyberlaw too. It is not just for lawyers.\nIf you read this description and take the course, I hope you will see that the course meets and exceeds the description, with considerable quality and effort. If you see that, and feel it is worthy of a five star review, I would appreciate that to recognize my efforts.\nThis is a shorter, free version of my full cyberlaw course.

      "description": "Many kinds of Trade require transport of goods in domestic market or internationally. If you are in similar type of business, probably , you need to find answer to few critical questions anytime entering a contract negotiation process. Questions like :\n1- Who is going to take care of Transport Costs ? Specially , costs related to loading and discharge of cargo at departure and destination ?\n2- Shall we insure the goods in transit ? If yes , who will pay for insurance costs? and for what type of insurance cover ?\n3- When and where will the risk of loss and damage to cargo pass from seller to the buyer?\n4- When are where will the title and ownership to cargo pass from seller to the buyer?\n5- Who will be responsible for taking import and export clearances and paying relevant duties?\n6- Is there any standard framework to provide a uniform picture for answering these questions when different markets and trades follow different customs and regulations?\nIn conclusion , \"What are the components of sales price offered by seller to the buyer ?\"\nBelieve it or not , you are not alone.\nAlmost everyone who enters a contract negotiation process involving cargo transport (specially in import/export business) is facing similar questions.\nThe problem is getting bigger as we notice that not only customs and regulations differ in different markets , but also , understanding from a single term of trade might be totally different for parties to the very same trade contract.\nInternational Chamber of Commerce introduced INCOTERMS Rules in 1936 to prevent unpleasant surprises, form a standard framework for negotiating transport related clauses in international and domestic contracts  , plus , creating a uniform picture for parties to trade contracts (which need cargo transport )on how, when and where do risks , costs and responsibilities pass from seller to the buyer ? Ever since , the INCOTERMS Rules are gone through periodic revisions to reflect developments and new requirements in the world of trade. Current revision of rules also known as INCOTERMS 2020 was published in September 2019.\nICC claims that main reason for introduction of INCOTERMS Rules is to offer uniform answers to transport related questions of parties to trade contracts at global level. However, history of INCOTERMS Rules shows that rules are generally misunderstood by users resulting creation of further problems in trade process for traders. This course is aims at providing participants with a comprehensive undertesting from INCOTERMS Rules in a concise and precise manner using a simple language.\nIf you are international trade professional, purchasing agent , international sales team member, international sales contract professional , logistics and transport professional , international finance professional , lawyer or a business and law student , this course is for you .\nBecause , at the end of this course , you will have answer to following questions :\n1- What are the INCOTERMS Rules?\n2- What do they do and what don't they do?\n3- How are they used in international (and domestic) sales contracts?\n4- What are the consequences of using wrong INCOTERMS Rule in your contract ?\n5- When and where do risks , costs and responsibilities to cargo in transit will pass from seller to the buyer under each of INCOTERMS 2020 Rules ?\n6- What are different variations of INCOTERMS Rules and what do they mean under different national laws?\n7- What is the criteria for choosing most suitable INCOTERMS 2020 Rule in your sales contract?",

You will need to really understand the products and business of the company you work for, in order to understand how it can be used for laundering money. For example, how is money lent, how are agricultural lands sold, how many types of insurance are there, etc. You have to know anything the launderer knows and a little more.\n\nI hope you will find my course helpful.\nGood luck!\n\n\nPS:\nFind below my qualifications relevant for this field:\n\nCertificate:  AML Foundations for Cryptoasset and Blockchain - issued by ACAMS, February 2024\nCourse: AML risk assessment – methodology - issued by the Romanian Banking Institute, April 2023\nCourse: KYC, AML/CFT and anti-fraud: strategy and planning - issued by the Romanian Banking Institute, October 2021\nGraduation of  The National Institute for professional training and improvement of lawyers of Romania - 2018\nMember of the Romanian Bucharest Bar - 2016\nMaster's degree in Business law - Law School, University of Bucharest, 2015 - 2016\nBachelor's degree in law - Law School, University of Bucharest, 2011 - 2015",

A solid IP management system must be in place if one is to fully profit from intellectual property in terms of income, reputation, and market share.\nIn order to guarantee that intellectual property is handled and managed successfully within organizations, the process of protecting it begins with identifying the same and creating the appropriate rules and procedures. A patent is one of the most significant types of intellectual property (IP) since it allows you to protect your fundamental technologies.\nThere are several benefits of the Intellectual Property Rights granted by law, both for the creator as well as for the society at large. Some of these benefits are:\nGreater Morality:\nIt is believed that Intellectual Property Rights is a form of spreading and supporting morality in the society as it helps support the basic human right of an individual to protect any creation of his own.\nFinancial Gains:\nGranting of Intellectual Property Rights by the law allows the creator to financially benefit from the work or property that he/she has created.\nEconomic Progress:\nAnother benefit of granting Intellectual Property Rights by law is that of overall economic growth of a country.\n\n\nThroughout the course all the concepts are explained using basic English. Learners are kept engaged right from the first module. We have used relevant images to add value to the content and done animations to make the course interesting and make it a visual treat for the learners.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nThis course is open for students, researchers & faculty members\nWorking professionals interested in IPR\n\n\nENROL SOON BY CLICK ON THE “ENROL” BUTTON AND GET BENEFITTED!",

Esses Incoterms eliminam ambiguidades ou inconsistências de vendas e contratos de remessa específicos do país. Isso torna mais fácil para vendedores e compradores identificar e gerenciar os custos e responsabilidades de transporte de carga entre a origem e os destinos de entrega.\n\n\nOs Incoterms são usados basicamente por compradores e vendedores para responder a perguntas como:\n\n\nQual Incoterm devo usar na minha negociação?\n\n\n\n\nQual parte é responsável pelos custos de envio?\n\n\nQual parte é responsável pelos custos do seguro?\n\n\nQual parte é responsável pelo desembaraço aduaneiro?\n\n\nEssas regras são aceitas por governos e autoridades regulatórias em todo o mundo. Como tal, eles são regularmente incorporados em contratos de vendas em todo o mundo, e uma versão específica dos Incoterms deve sempre ser referenciada no texto de cada contrato.\n\n\nPortanto, se você é um exportador ou importador, ou estudante de comércio exterior, comprador internacional ou empreendedor, este curso é definitivamente para você.\n\n\nMesmo que você não tenha experiência em comércio exterior, pode compreender facilmente os conceitos, já que expliquei os tópicos de tal forma que nenhum conhecimento prévio de comércio exterior é necessário para iniciar este curso.\n\n\n\n\nEste curso irá explicar todos os conceitos de uma maneira muito simples e lúcida, rápida e prática.\n\n\nAo concluir este curso, você não cometerá nenhum erro ao escolher o Incoterm correto e incorporá-lo ao texto do seu contrato.\n\n\nPortanto, não perca este curso incrivelmente projetado e bem delineado sobre Incoterms  2020.\n\n\nInscreva-se agora e eu o encontrarei novamente dentro do curso.",

      "description": "The Business Law and Ethics course is the second part of the three that together form the Business Law series.\nAs a manager, you have both legal and ethical responsibilities. Your conduct is expected to meet both the letter and the spirit of the law. Managers who bypass their ethical responsibilities risk getting themselves and their companies into deep legal trouble. Corporate scandals have ruined both careers and companies.\nAs a manager, you need to learn about business ethics and how to use ethics as a guiding rationale when dealing with your responsibilities. This is crucial because ethical principles provide the basis for the spirit of the law. This course guides you in differentiating between ethics and the law, as well as in recognizing areas where the two concepts overlap.\nIt explains the difference between following the letter of the law and following the spirit of the law. And it covers a process you can use to make ethical decisions that comply with the spirit of the law. The course also outlines typical obstacles to ethical behavior in business, and steps managers can take to build a strong culture of ethics in their companies.\nBy understanding and providing ethical management, you'll help to encourage ethical behavior in your organization. This can protect you, your employees, and your company, and help attract both customers and investors. Ultimately, ethical behavior means better business.\nThis is the broad picture. This is what you can expect from the course and you can already start. No go ahead and push that   \"Register Now\" button and see you inside the course!",

      "description": "(IL)LEGAL MANIPULATION\nWe all know that, in the legal world, persuasion and oratory capabilities are a defining factor in legal outcomes.\nNamely, in court.\nIn this course, we are going to explore how manipulation in specific is used in legal settings.\nNot only in court with witnesses, plaintiffs, defendants, but even with clients as a legal team.\nWe will explore all the major types of manipulation, and how each can be used in a legal settings.\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the nine main types of manipulation you can fall prey to (consistency manipulation, emotional manipulation, effort manipulation, standard manipulation, pressure manipulation, identification manipulation, fact manipulation, context manipulation and labeling manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how the psychological principle of consistency works, and how people use it to force others to act in alignment with what they have said or done before;\nYou'll learn about the persuasion technique of active choice - forcing someone to state something in the first person, such as \"I will do this\" or \"I will buy\" in order to force them to keep aligned with their statement later;\nYou'll learn about the persuasion principle of escalation of commitment. By asking for small favors or small agreements, you can then ask for bigger and bigger ones later;\nYou'll learn about why getting someone to take action on something makes them more likely to value it. For example, the IKEA effect - you will like more a piece of furniture if you've put in effort towards assembling it yourself;\nYou'll learn about how habits are a form of consistency. What you do once, twice ends up becoming ingrained in you;\nYou'll learn about the psychological principle of rationalisation - how people make emotional decisions, and then later try and justify them with logic;\nYou'll learn about how emotional manipulation works, by forcing the other side to feel a specific emotion, or feel guilty for their actions against you, such as emotional blackmail;\nYou'll learn about how hype and desire work by building up something in a person's mind, regardless of its actual value in reality;\nYou'll learn about how the concept of twisting the knife works, by making someone visualize the nightmare scenario of something to later drive them to action;\nYou'll learn about how bullying and emotional blackmail work, taking negative actions and forcing the person to feel responsible for them;\nYou'll learn about how fear and panic work. If you \"press someone's buttons\", you can easily drive them to action emotionally;\nYou'll learn about why emotional manipulation relies on the victim identifying with the person's reactions, and how the key in avoiding it is to eliminate those trained reactions;\nYou'll learn about the psychological concept of perceived effort - why, when something seems easier to do, people are more likely to do it - and how this effort can be changed;\nYou'll learn about how \"low-effort words\" such as \"quick\", \"simple\" and \"easy\" can be used to make something seem less effortful;\nYou'll learn about how reducing the number of available options makes people take action more easily (the paradox of choice);\nYou'll learn about how preempting doubt and negative situations can drive people to action (tackle their objection before they even have it and they are more likely to do something);\nYou'll learn about the concept of implementation intention (asking someone \"How would you do this?\" or \"What would it take?\" makes them visualize it, which makes it less effort, and makes them more likely to do it);\nYou'll learn about how inserting structure and/or progress into a process makes people more likely to finish it (\"You are at step 3 of 4\");\nYou'll learn about how standard manipulation works by having different standards for different people or elements;\nYou'll learn about how standards can be made different by hiding the criteria used in the first place;\nYou'll learn about how standards can be manipulated by making exceptions for specific people;\nYou'll learn about how motivated reasoning works (we do more diligence on the things we don't like, and vice-versa);\nYou'll learn about how unexpected rigidity changes standards (on paper, the requirements are the same, but unofficially, there are different things that different people must comply with);\nYou'll learn about how standard manipulation relies on hiding the criteria used in the first place, and the key to disarming it is through transparency, and forcing comparisons between cases;\nYou'll learn about how pressuring the other person using your presence and intensity is a dangerous type of manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how intimidation in specific works, by pressuring the other person so much you prevent them from even talking or contesting you;\nYou'll learn about how urgency works by forcing you to make an unprepared decision, using, for example, deadlines, or limiting the availability of something (in reality or just in your perception);\nHow bluffing and escalation dominance work - the other side takes action repeatedly as to never give you an opportunity;\nYou'll learn about how identification manipulation works, through the other side pretending to have something in common with you to make you more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how empathy works, showing understanding of the other side, but also how it can be manipulated to make you feel understood and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how affect labeling works, decreasing the intensity of your emotions by addressing them verbally, and stopping you from feeling emotions intensely;\nYou'll learn about how mirroring works, making someone feel subconsciously understood, which leads them to trust the other side more and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about how common ground works - mentioning tastes or life experiences in common with others to make them trust you more and be more influenceable;\nYou'll learn about why the biological principle of caring about others makes us tend to be nice to others who understand us - or pretend to - and makes us open to manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how fact manipulation works through simplifying, hiding or just lying about facts;\nYou'll learn about how statistics can be misleading by changing axes, comparisons, timeframes or others;\nYou'll learn about how lack of transparency about competing or contradictory information can make fake facts seem more real, and why comparison with other elements is crucial to avoid this type of manipulation;\nYou'll learn about how context manipulation works - by changing what you compare something to, you change its perceived value;\nYou'll learn about how you can choose what you contrast something to in order to change the value of something ($20 book vs. $10 ones is expensive, vs. $70 ones is cheap);\nYou'll learn about how you can change the option set you place yourself in to change your value and manipulate the other side (for example, as a professional, comparing yourself to other teams, to other people in the same team, to other people in the same position in the past, or other comparisons);\nYou'll learn about how the peak-end effect works - by having one highlight and ending on a high note, people forget about negative or boring parts of a presentation;\nYou'll learn about why context manipulation relies on us subconsciously accepting the options we're given instead of contesting them;\nYou'll learn about how labeling manipulation works - by giving something a specific name, even if simplistic or negative, it tends to stick, and spreads easily;\nYou'll learn about how bullying works by using negative labels - labeling someone a \"failure\", or \"loser\", or similar, and making it spread;\nYou'll learn about how stereotypes are a type of labeling manipulation - labeling a large quantity of people with simplistic names;\nYou'll learn about how the presence or absence of a name can humanize or de-humanize someone, making them a \"true person\" or a nameless stranger;\nYou'll learn about how scientific-sounding words can be used to make something seem of higher authority, without actually changing anything in it (saying \"a theory\" instead of \"a thought\", or using words in product names such as \"quantum\", \"exponential\", \"atomic\" or similar);\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your knowledge of how to protect yourself from manipulation to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

Next to industry, country or even culture-specific norms on privacy, there is a universal standard to follow when you are at work.\nThis standard is now being set by the GDPR, the European Union’s regulation that is increasingly followed all over the world. The regulation and similar laws in different states require to train employees and associates, as the level of data protection depends on all staff members, including you.\nWe will start from scratch to clarify your understanding of what are personal data, what it means to process them and on whose behalf you act. You will learn what principles to apply, how to secure information and how to act in case a breach occurs. I will also cover providing information, collecting consents and handling data subject requests.\nHaving worked at the supervisory authority and carried out many data protection projects in national and international firms, now I tell what an every single staff member needs to know and follow in daily work. There is no time for theory and data protection is probably not the most important part of your job. But it is a part you want to approach efficiently, so privacy is respected and breaches are not likely to happen.\nIn case of legal proceedings or an inspection, the authority examines if you and your organization applied adequate measures to protect data. Also your clients might require your company to provide them with guarantees. Complete this training and start taking right steps",

We will guide you from the foundational concepts of the regulation through its practical applications and future societal impacts. Our course begins by clearly defining the Act's purpose, scope, and key terminology. We then move into a deep, practical analysis of its core component: the innovative risk-based framework. We will explain in detail how AI systems are meticulously categorized as prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, or minimal-risk, and what these classifications mean for you and your organization. A major portion of the course focuses on the stringent obligations for high-risk systems, from data quality and technical documentation to human oversight and cybersecurity protocols. We will define the crucial roles and responsibilities of all parties involved, including providers, implementers, and end-users. We will dedicate a separate, dedicated module to the specific rules governing general-purpose AI models and the criteria used to determine systemic impact. The course concludes with an examination of the governance structure, enforcement mechanisms, and the global effects of this groundbreaking law. By the time you finish this course, you will have a robust understanding of the Act's purpose, scope, and impact on the global technology landscape.",

Is Luck!\nEvery Single Day in The United States Alone, 109,589 Lawsuits Are Filed...\nWithout a system to protect your wealth and assets, they are in danger every single day that you do business. Simply put, just one frivolous lawsuit by one gold-digging attorney and your entire life’s work – wealth and assets – can be gone. That’s the biggest reason why I designed Three Secret Ways to Protect Yourself From Lawsuits … to protect myself and good people like you from nuisance lawsuits.\nIn the California case Peake vs. Underwood, a buyer filed suit two years after purchasing the property stating that the seller had not disclosed the condition of the property when it had been sold. The buyer maintained that both the seller and the listing agent had known that the property had unresolved drainage issues and never told her.\nGuess what? The buyer dropped the lawsuit against the seller when she learned that they did not own anything of value. She continued to pursue the listing agent. Why? She was trying to win that “lawsuit lottery” and bluff her way into a settlement – but the sellers had protected themselves. Eventually, the court found her out and ordered her to pay $60,000 in sanctions for the frivolous lawsuits, but who wants to deal with all that silliness? The owners were smart – on paper they didn’t have anything worth suing for.\nNow plenty of smart lawyers and accountants can build up a whole façade of protection that would take 4 private investigators and 6 computers to figure out, but in the end, nobody really knows who owns the property in question. Here’s a hint – if you can’t explain it, it won’t work!\nMany asset protection plans that folks try to sell become so complicated that not even the client can explain how assets are held or how those assets were transferred. The downside is that those questions can be expected in depositions or a discovery examination, and a failure to fully and clearly explain what happened and why will make the court very suspicious and potentially give the court grounds to begin disregarding entities or setting aside transfers. Most judges start asking themselves, “What is really going on here?” if the structure and transfers are too complicated and not well explained.\nThis course is an introduction to the three types of Trusts I personally use every day in my business.\nEnroll today!",

Mục tiêu chính của Chỉ thị là buộc các công ty phải xác định, ngăn chặn, giảm thiểu và chấm dứt các tác động tiêu cực đến nhân quyền và môi trường trong hoạt động của chính họ, các công ty con và toàn bộ chuỗi giá trị của họ.\nNói một cách đơn giản, CSDDD yêu cầu các doanh nghiệp phải \"nhìn sâu\" vào cách thức sản phẩm của họ được sản xuất, từ nguyên liệu thô ban đầu cho đến khi đến tay người tiêu dùng, để đảm bảo rằng không có hành vi vi phạm nhân quyền (như lao động cưỡng bức, lao động trẻ em, điều kiện làm việc không an toàn) hoặc gây hại cho môi trường (như phá rừng, ô nhiễm, sử dụng tài nguyên quá mức) xảy ra trong chuỗi cung ứng.\nTại sao tổ chức bạn cần triển khai và tuân thủ CSDDD?\nBảo vệ Nhân quyền và Môi trường: Đây là động lực cốt lõi, nhằm giải quyết các vấn đề cấp bách về xã hội và môi trường trong chuỗi giá trị toàn cầu.\nTạo sân chơi bình đẳng: CSDDD giúp tạo ra một sân chơi công bằng hơn cho các doanh nghiệp, đảm bảo rằng những công ty ưu tiên tính bền vững không bị thiệt thòi so với những công ty bỏ qua các vấn đề này.\nGiảm thiểu rủi ro cho doanh nghiệp: Bằng cách chủ động xác định và quản lý các rủi ro về nhân quyền và môi trường, doanh nghiệp có thể tránh được các vụ kiện tụng, thiệt hại về danh tiếng và gián đoạn chuỗi cung ứng.\nThúc đẩy chuyển đổi xanh: Chỉ thị này là một phần quan trọng trong nỗ lực lớn hơn của EU nhằm đạt được các mục tiêu của Thỏa thuận Xanh Châu Âu (European Green Deal) và chuyển đổi sang nền kinh tế xanh và tuần hoàn.\nĐối tượng áp dụng của CSDDD là ai?\nCSDDD sẽ áp dụng cho các công ty EU lớn có hơn 1.000 nhân viên và doanh thu ròng toàn cầu trên 450 triệu EUR.\nCông ty có hơn 250 nhân viên và doanh thu ròng toàn cầu trên 40 triệu EUR, với ít nhất 20 triệu EUR doanh thu được tạo ra trong một hoặc nhiều lĩnh vực rủi ro cao (ví dụ: dệt may, nông nghiệp, khoáng sản).\nCác công ty ngoài EU (bao gồm Việt Nam) nhưng đạt ngưỡng doanh thu ròng đáng kể tại EU (tương tự các ngưỡng trên cho công ty EU). Điều này có nghĩa là các doanh nghiệp Việt Nam, nếu có hoạt động kinh doanh hoặc chuỗi cung ứng liên quan đến EU và đạt ngưỡng doanh thu, sẽ nằm trong phạm vi ảnh hưởng của Chỉ thị này.\nĐâu là Cơ hội cho Doanh nghiệp Việt Nam liên quan đến CSDDD?\nCác doanh nghiệp chủ động tuân thủ sẽ có lợi thế cạnh tranh khi tiếp cận thị trường EU và các thị trường khó tính khác.\nViệc thể hiện cam kết về bền vững giúp xây dựng hình ảnh tích cực và thu hút khách hàng, nhà đầu tư.\nGiúp doanh nghiệp nhận diện và giải quyết các vấn đề tiềm ẩn trước khi chúng gây nên khủng hoảng.\nQuá trình thẩm định có thể giúp doanh nghiệp phát hiện ra các điểm yếu và cơ hội để cải thiện hiệu quả hoạt động và giảm lãng phí.\nCác nhà đầu tư ngày càng quan tâm đến các doanh nghiệp có hồ sơ bền vững mạnh mẽ.\nCho dù tổ chức của bạn đã có chương trình triển khai và thẩm định bền vững theo yêu cầu đối tác EU hay việc phát triển một chương trình như vậy mới là ý tưởng đang thai nghén, khóa học này sẽ giúp bạn cập nhật phương pháp và xu hướng mới nhất, tối ưu hóa nguồn lực, và dẫn dắt toàn tổ chức thiết lập một chương trình hiệu quả cao.\nMục tiêu khóa học:\nHiểu rõ bản chất, mục tiêu và phạm vi áp dụng của CSDDD.\nNắm vững các yêu cầu và nghĩa vụ chính mà CSDDD đặt ra cho doanh nghiệp.\nĐánh giá được tác động của CSDDD đối với doanh nghiệp Việt Nam, đặc biệt trong chuỗi cung ứng toàn cầu.\nTrang bị kiến thức và công cụ cần thiết để xây dựng và triển khai hệ thống thẩm định bền vững hiệu quả.\nNhận diện cơ hội và thách thức, từ đó xây dựng chiến lược phù hợp để tuân thủ và phát triển bền vững.\nChúng tôi tiếp tục thực hiện cam kết lâu dài đồng hành cùng Việt Nam và các doanh nghiệp địa phương, trong hành trình tạo ra giá trị và xây dựng một tương lai ngày càng bền vững, trong đó, không gì hiệu quả hơn là đào tạo, để nâng cao nhận thức, bồi dưỡng năng lực và thúc đẩy hành động.\nThông qua cách tiếp cận bình dân hóa, bản địa hóa và đơn giản hóa các khái niệm, khuôn khổ học thuật toàn cầu, chúng tôi nỗ lực đóng góp vào việc xây dựng một cộng đồng, một thế hệ mới có đủ tâm và tầm để gánh vác tương lai Việt Nam.\nĐây là khóa chuyên biệt đầu tiên về các bộ luật bền vững EU, nằm trong Chương trình Đào tạo ESG và Chuyển đổi Xanh, bao gồm 20 khóa thành phần, được nghiên cứu và thiết kế kỹ lưỡng trong hơn 3 năm, bởi nhóm chuyên gia đa quốc gia hàng đầu, trong và ngoài YTT Consulting, dành riêng cho thị trường Việt Nam.\nChương trình được tích hợp từ góc nhìn nghiên cứu học thuật tiên tiến nhất và các mô hình, kỹ thuật độc quyền, đúc kết từ nhiều năm kinh nghiệm tư vấn triển khai tại nhiều tổ chức đa ngành trên toàn cầu, như: Unilever, AstraZeneca, Walt Disney, Heineken, Rolls-Royce, Shell, Beko và nhiều tổ chức khác; với sự tham vấn của nhiều chuyên gia trong nước, dựa trên bối cảnh đặc thù Việt Nam. Phương pháp giảng dạy gần gũi bằng Tiếng Việt, trên cơ sở đa dạng các tài liệu gốc bằng Tiếng Anh, nhằm khuyến khích bạn soi chiếu, phản biện và tiếp tục đào sâu nghiên cứu sau mỗi buổi học.\nCác khóa học sẽ như từng nấc thang, dẫn dắt bạn vạch mây mù đi tới đỉnh cao của khoa học ứng dụng vị sinh thái, trở thành một phần lịch sử, tạo nên thế giới ngày càng tốt đẹp cho muôn loài.\nESG, Tính bền vững, hay Khả năng Phục hồi là một lĩnh vực rộng và đặc thù đang tiến hóa nhanh chóng trong một thế giới VUCA, nên toàn bộ Chương trình đào tạo cũng như từng khóa học sẽ luôn được cập nhật và cải thiện, cá nhân tôi cam kết trả lời các thắc mắc và hỗ trợ, đồng hành cùng bạn trong suốt hành trình.\nTôi sẽ hướng dẫn bạn từng bước, mọi thứ bạn cần biết để thành công với tư cách là người dẫn đầu về tính bền vững.\nHãy ghi danh và đồng hành cùng chúng tôi làm nên một thế giới ngày càng bền vững cho tất cả!\nVô cùng cảm ơn bạn!",

      "description": "★ JOIN MORE THAN 20,000 STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO COPYRIGHT THEIR WORK ON THEIR OWN!\n\n\nWhether you’re a blogger, artist, author, photographer, or anyone else who creates works of arts to support yourself, you will need to protect your creative work in the form of copyright protection.\nDeveloping creative works represents an important investment of time, effort, and other valuable resources.\nTaking steps to secure your work is an important aspect of protecting your investment.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be well-equipped to use copyright protection for your benefit and to avoid serious legal issues with copyright infringement.\nEverything you need to know about copyright is in this course so you don’t have to worry about missing anything.\n\n\nWHAT IS COPYRIGHT?\nIntellectual property rights are legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind. The purpose of intellectual property rights is to promote the progress of artists by giving creators exclusive rights to their works.\nAs you can imagine, if you created something and everybody had the right to use it without paying you, not very many people would go through the trouble of creating anything!\nCopyright is a law that gives you ownership over the things you create. Copyright also allows you to legally protect your creative work.\nCopyright protects any kind of creative work, including photos, videos, blogs, books, articles, songs, plays, sculptures, sound recordings, and other creative works. When you create any of these, you own the copyright to it.\nCopyright to these creative works are your rights and your rights alone. Unless you willingly give permission for anyone to do any of these, no one can violate them legally.\nIn general, it’s illegal for anyone use or copy your work without your permission, but there are some exceptions and limitation to Copyright — Fair Use and Public Domain — both which we will cover in detail in this course.\nTypically, content creators, authors, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals need copyright protection for their work.\n\n\nWHY DO I NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE?\nThe Internet is fast becoming a sanctuary of copyright abuse.\nThe idea of freedom of information and the ease of posting, copying and distributing messages online has created a false impression that text and graphic posted online are except from copyright protection. However, this is not true.\nCopyright law was established not to give the author the right to deny his or her work to other people, but instead to encourage its creation.\nCopyright is a delicate balance between the rights of the creator and the public’s interest.\nWhen it comes to photos, images, and content, when in doubt, assume it’s subject to copyright and don’t use it without the appropriate permission.\nThere are many free resources for images and videos, whether public domain, licensed creative commons or inexpensive stock images, that you can find as a resource in this course so you really shouldn’t need to use copyright-protected works for your blog, website, or video.\nMy goal in this course is to help you better understand how to use images, videos, text, and other content in a way that is both legal and respectful of the author’s ownership rights.\nFair Use may be an exception allowing you to use copyrighted content, but chances are you’ll find your content taken down by your host if the copyright holder disagrees.\n\n\n★ BONUS CONTENT & TOOLS ★\n\nHow to Use Content That Isn't Yours - quick but comprehensive summary of what you should do if you want to use any image, video, or content that isn't yours. Don't use anyone else's content until you've reviewed this!\nResources of Images You Can Use Without Legal Trouble- it’s common practice to snag photos off Google Images, but just because everyone is doing it doesn’t make it right. In the course you will find a great source of websites you can use to find pictures without worrying about copyright infringement.\nResources of Videos You Can Use Without Legal Trouble - You are free to embed any video from YouTube and other video platform on your blog or website as long as it gives you the embed option. That being said, you can’t necessarily use parts from videos on YouTube  to make mashups or as part of another video. Be sure to have permission to use any video that you are cutting, making changes to, or adding to a project.\n\n\nThank you for making this the best selling Copyright course on Udemy! I show my gratitude by consistently making new lectures and answering your questions in the course discussion!\n\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n★ Enroll right now!",

This section includes two lectures on Antarctica and the Antarctica Treaty; a lecture on the Law of the Sea and how that relates to Space; and finally, a primer on Customary International law, which applies where there are otherwise no treaties. At the end of this course you will be better able to assess the law where business opportunities are emerging, apply and navigate the basics of space law, and draw from other areas of law in solving conflicts in space. (Note: None of this course constitutes legal advice and you should consult your own attorney for any questions you may have.)",

Cada vez que tomamos un café o un taxi, estamos celebrando un contrato. También cuando arrendamos o compramos una casa para vivir. Y, por supuesto, cuando contratamos a un profesional, sea éste un médico, un abogado, un pintor o un agente inmobiliario.\n\n\nLos contratos están en todas partes y, sin embargo, muchas veces no comprendemos del todo su contenido ni a qué nos estamos obligando cuando firmamos un contrato. O desconocemos cuáles son las normas que regulan el contrato y que  influyen en su contenido porque implican que parte del contrato no se puede aplicar o puede ser impugnado.\n\n\nEn este completo curso sobre contratos abordamos, desde un punto de vista eminentemente práctico y utilizando muchos ejemplos, todo lo relativo a la regulación de los contratos, comenzando con las obligaciones (que son la base de los contratos), los elementos esenciales del contrato, cláusulas contractuales más comunes y, por último, estudiaremos en detalle en los contratos más comunes: la compraventa, el arrendamiento, el mandato, el contrato de prestación de servicios y el contrato de obra.\n\n\nUn curso completo, con un enfoque eminentemente práctico, que busca simplificar conceptos jurídicos complejos y acercarlos a cualquier persona que quiera entender por qué los contratos tienen el contenido que tienen y qué es lo que implica cada una de las cláusulas que se incluyen en un contrato.\n\n\n¡Invierte en tu futuro! ¡Inscríbete hoy!",

      "description": "Human expression has always fascinated me. In this presentation, I begin by addressing the “villain” stereotype that is hoisted on a criminal defendant from the moment the jury enters a courtroom and what we can do to blunt it. We are all familiar with catch phrases like, “To really know what another person is going through, you need to walk a day in their shoes.” Truer words have never been spoken and this saying is a fundamental tenet for being a zealous trial lawyer. But practically speaking, empathy can be hard, especially when the person you’re defending is accused of doing bad things.\n\n\nWe’ll explore this topic from a different perspective that may forever change the way you view your clients. We’ll also explore some exercises that will help you to expand your capacity for human connection so that you can relate more to your clients.\n\n\nWe will them move into psychology where I will introduce you to Carl Jung and how his teachings have been used by Hollywood producers for generations to tell some of the most riveting stories on the big screen. I’ll dissect it, provide you with examples, and then show you how this same framework can be applied in the courtroom when you stand up to tell your client’s story.",

This advanced course—Generative AI for Contracting, Legal Drafting and Transactional Efficiency—prepares legal professionals to leverage cutting-edge AI techniques to streamline every stage of contract creation, negotiation, and review. Starting with the foundational principles of “What is Generative AI” and “AI for Law,” learners quickly progress into understanding the deep integration of large language models (LLMs) within Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) systems. The course then introduces a structured prompt engineering approach tailored for lawyers and paralegals—focusing on prompt styles (instructional vs analytical), zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques, and strategic prompt recipes for real legal use cases.\nParticipants will learn to generate clauses, definitions, representations, and fallback language using prompt templates customized for employment, vendor, procurement, SaaS, and licensing agreements. The course also includes hands-on exercises in building and modularizing clause libraries, localizing contracts to jurisdiction-specific rules, detecting clause deviations, and automating redline comparisons. You’ll be able to use AI to flag risky clauses, predict litigation outcomes, and automatically generate audit trails, version notes, LOIs, and post-deal checklists.\nThe latter half of the course explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for querying legal databases, embedding citations and precedents into prompt chains, referencing tools like Westlaw and Lexis, and structuring AI-generated legal outputs into professional summaries and compliance-ready documents. By the end, you’ll unlock access to 1000+ expertly designed prompts purpose-built for legal automation—ready to deploy across law firms, legal departments, and document automation systems.\nWhether you're a corporate counsel, legal ops analyst, or paralegal innovator, this course arms you with AI-powered tools to draft smarter, mitigate risk, and accelerate transactional velocity at scale.",

      "description": "This course may well be the most beneficial and lucrative online course you will ever take. The Executive Juris Doctor course was developed to meet the needs of those who seek to acquire a rudimentary understanding of the American legal system, without necessarily being prepared to argue matters in a courtroom. It should be the objective of any executive juris doctor program – to understand the basic principles of law and be able to think like a lawyer. Getting a good grasp of the fundamental courses in law, eg, contracts, torts, and criminal law, is vital to understanding the general principles of law and how the system of law interacts with business and society.\nTaking notes and developing an outline is standard practice for law students and helps significantly to retain important information. In the study of law, try to think in an iambic pentameter manner. Always be able to argue both sides. Be able to go back and forth. This is so that you may better anticipate what the other side is going to argue.\nIn this course you’ll learn about contract law, the formation, implementation, and the enforcement of contracts will be covered in this series of 30 chapters. Torts (civil law) and procedure will also be covered. You will learn about criminal law and procedure (which is great for learning strategies), evidence, and property law. You will become familiar with family law, as well as Wills and trust law. In addition, you will come to understand the basics of corporations and LLC law. Finally, you will learn about constitutional law. Understanding the basic principles of law is extremely beneficial for entrepreneurs and business professionals alike. The information is basically generic so it really doesn't matter where you hear it from or where you read it.  The definition of murder is the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another. This is true whether you learned it at Harvard Law School or in this online series of courses. The information is the same.  The depth you choose to study is what will make the difference in the long run.\nThe textbook, Executive Juris Doctor, is available online at Barnes & Noble, Booksellers.",

      "description": "First and foremost Congratulations for making it to this page and thinking about being an Independent Director (ID) in a listed company in India. This is probably the only mock test that you will ever need to clear your exams.\nCurrently there is a huge shortage of IDs and the industry is looking to desperately fill in this gap with qualified and experienced persons such as yourself. The role is aspirational and very well respected in the industry. The role carries significant importance in Corporate decision making and you get compensated quite well (depending on the company) per meeting as sitting fees and performance bonuses. Apart from the compensation, there is always a significant self learning that occurs from the respective company, sector and industry and the networking with other IDs, MDs and CEOs. You will see yourself making a positive impact, and hence this endeavor can indeed be hugely satisfying.\nIn October 2019, the MCA made it compulsory for independent directors to pass the online self-assessment proficiency test, which is conducted by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA). To clear this hurdle, several aspiring independent directors, irrespective of their age, are getting ready. The independent director’s databank was jointly established by the MCA and IICA in December 2019.\nTwo criteria must be met – the individual should find a place on the IICA’s databank and successfully complete the online self-assessment proficiency test. Independent directors (who are not exempted ; only few categories are exempt) have two years from the date of inclusion in the databank to pass the online self-assessment proficiency test.\nThe online self-assessment proficiency test is conducted by the IICA and ensures that only candidates who are competent – such as possessing  a broad understanding of Companies Act, board decisions and their implications – will be eligible to serve as independent directors in India.\nThis course comprises of 4 mock tests for candidates who desire to pass the mandatory proficiency test and is my humble attempt to familiarize yourself with the content. The syllabus is varied, covering predominantly Companies Act 2013, Securities Law, basic accountancy, accounting details, financial ratios, secretarial audit and secretarial standards, all about board composition and functions, corporate social responsibility, corporate frauds, including case studies, and enterprise risk management.\nIf you come from a Tech or any non-business background, the course and exam can be a challenge.  A reading of the Companies Act 2013 is recommended before attempting these mock tests. A latest version of the Act is freely available for download from the MCA site. The mock tests are a good practice before you appear for the final test. They are designed to impart knowledge, build your confidence and enhance your chances of success.\nThe actual test is not a race against time like most other competitive entrance exams. It is about understanding the fundamentals and choosing the right answer. At times if you are unsure, all four choices appear correct ! Good luck.\nFor more information on being an Independent Director please visit the official website of IICA.\n*Disclaimer: This author assumes no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of this course.
