A superior vacuum and a handpiece are used in exfoliating the stratum corneum layers with the use of aluminum oxide crystals. The treatment causes cell turnover by stimulating the fibroblast in producing new cells.\nIt also results in an improved flow of blood. Students will learn through lectures and theory and have clinical practical hours for the hands-on experience. Among the things to learn is the diamond-tip technique and how to do tactile tests with accuracy. The benefits of learning this course are that it is a modern and painless treatment which will help attract new clientele. The procedure is also versatile and can be combined with other treatments for better results.",

Gel manicures are more expensive than regular nail polish, and can provide a  stable income for a beginner doing nails.\nGel nails can also last up to two weeks without chipping or fading, compared to regular nail polish and if done correctly you will start to get a return on your investment by retaining loyal gel nail clients bi-weekly.\nIf you are thinking about starting a nail business from home this can be an entry-level nail service you can provide to start your at-home business\n\n\nYahsheika Wilks has been doing nails for the past 15 years, in this course, She will show you how to do a professional dry manicure treatment at home so you can start doing your own gel nails professionally and save hundreds of dollars by learning how to do gel nails yourself.\n\n\nYou I will learn how to:\nPrepare the natural nail bed for gel nails application\nRemoval of nail callus and cuticles from the nail plate\nUse a nail drill bit to file down the nails and remove excess cuticles\nUse cuticle bits and several other drill bits and know the differences\nIdentify the differences between UV and LED gel lamps\nApply gel extensions to the natural nails to enhance the length of the free-edge\nApply builder gel to create no-tip extensions sculping the nails\nKnow how  properly use nail forms\nDo gel nail art and designs\nDo Gel Ombre Nails\nDo beautiful French nail designs\nRemove gel polish\nFix problems during the gel polish application\nKnow the  proper equipment and supplies you will need for gel nails\nLearn quick tips to solve most gel polish problems\n\n\n\n\nWhether you are a beginner nail technician or want to do gels at home, this course will teach you everything you need to know to create beautiful, long-lasting gel nails\n\n\nBefore we go any further let’s discuss what is “GEL”\nGel polish is made up of acrylic monomers and oligomers they are bonded together when placed under UV light. This process is called curing, and in a matter of seconds, the once-liquid gel turns into a hard, chemical-resistant coating.\nGel manicures are one of the simplest forms of nail treatment someone can do at home on themselves. But the setback to this is that people at home may use:\nImproper techniques when applying gel\nThey may also use the wrong wattage of bulb for their gel nail lamps\nThey may also apply too much gel polish to the nail when it is not opaque immediately\nAnd this can sometimes cause wrinkling and bubbles on the nail surface\nWhich causes the gel to peel\nAll these situations may cause applying gel to become more difficult as a beginner and you may become easily discouraged because you’re not getting it done correctly.\n\n\nLearning how to do gel nails can be a great choice to earn extra income, and a great benefit to earn a new skill.\nHowever,\nNot knowing the correct equipment and supplies you will need\nOr not knowing exactly how you should use them\nCan hinder your dreams of becoming a manicurist\nOr even stop you entirely from doing gel nails\n\n\nWhen it comes down to gel nails you will need to practice and learn how to manipulate gel to be very good at it. Gel polish is a self-leveling product and sometimes gel polish techniques cannot be rushed.\nGel polish can sometimes cause a wide array of issues if it’s not done correctly, especially when you're using products you have no idea about.\nDifferent gel polishes depending on their chemical properties may have other recommended drying times or may require specific nail lamps\nThat’s why in this course she has covered so much, so you can have a better understanding of how to do gel nails at home and increase your chances of doing better gel nails.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have the skills and confidence to give yourself a salon-worthy gel-polished nail anytime\n\n\nAs BONUS I will include the following:\nDownloadable gel polish practice sheets\nDownloadable sheets of nail drill bits\nDownloadable sheets of nail anatomy\nCourse resources\nPractical assignments\nAnd knowledgeable Quizzes\n\n\nSo get ready to learn gel nail skills, that will take you to the next level!

      "description": "DO YOU WANT GLOWING, RADIANT SKIN?\nIt is all about your skincare ingredients.\nYou absolutely do not need a long list of complicated ingredients or a complex formulation for softer, fresher, younger looking skin. You need the RIGHT ingredients.\nThe right ingredients are the nourishing, healing botanicals. Why do you think the the big cosmetic brands are now featuring them? They have finally figured it out.\nIt only takes a few of these beneficial botanicals to make a cleanser, a mask, a steam, a toner or a moisturizer. In the time it takes to go to the store to purchase expensive commercial products, you can easily make each product at home. An hour or so of kitchen fun will provide all your skincare needs for two to six months.\nThere are so many benefits to creating your own facial skincare you will wonder why you didn't start sooner!\nAvoid unsafe chemicals and preservatives of commercial products\nTaylor your skincare to your exact needs\nCreate gentle cleansers that don’t strip beneficial oils from the skin\nDeeply nourish the skin for long-term benefits\nPay for the ingredients, not the 500% markup for marketing and packaging of commercial products\nThis course gives you the simple skills you need to easily create a complete daily and weekly facial regimen for ultimately healthy and vibrant skin.\nHere’s what students have to say:\n★★★★★ \"I really loved this course. I did not realise making homemade skincare could be so straightforward, or the results so nourishing and beneficial. Beautifully and clearly presented, too.” – Katrina L\n★★★★★ \"I love this class! My hubby and I have both been using the lotion and some oil blends I made. I also steam when I remember. We are looking so much healthier! We've been using the homemade products for about two months. I love tailoring the lotions and cleansers to our needs. Some of my fine lines are going away! Thanks for putting this class together!” – Pixie M\n★★★★★ \"I really liked this course. Elizabeth gave an excellent demo, not only how to mix the products, but what the different ingredients would do for you, how to protect your final product and great recommendation for other products. I have watched other \"how-to\" homemade skincare courses, this is really worth the time and money.” – Crystal\n★★★★★ \"As an older adult, I am looking for ways to save the skin. As a celiac I have to be careful with what I use. This class was actually very good. I wasn't sure I wanted recipes when I signed up. After already making the cleanser, my skin feels better. I am looking forward to making the other products now.” – Faith F\n★★★★★ \"Elizabeth shares a wealth of knowledge in this course, explaining beautifully and succinctly what ingredients to use for various skin types and WHY to use each individual ingredient. I really enjoyed the fun beauty tips as well! I've taken several courses by Elizabeth and I would highly recommend each and every course!” – J.N. S\nThis course emphasizes healing botanicals\nBotanicals offer profound nourishment inside and out. The cosmetic industry is catching on. Companies large and small are adopting plant-based formulations and revisiting botanical ingredients that have been used with great effectiveness for centuries. Yet what you pay at the counter largely covers the enormous costs for marketing, packaging, insurance, administration and retail overhead. Avoid the costs, preservatives and often unsafe chemicals by making your own skincare in lovingly wholesome small batches.\nYou will never find better skincare than what you make yourself. It is easier than you think!\nThe course offers:\nDetailed simple recipes\nLearning from a professional formulator of natural botanical skincare\nKnowledge to create complete daily and weekly regimens of fabulous quality skincare\nEasy step-by-step instructions to formulate for mature or dry skin types\nUnderstanding of the most beneficial and effective ingredients for great beauty\nYou will learn detailed information about making, using and storing your skincare creations including:\nCleansers\nSteam\nMask\nToner\nMoisturizers\nThis course is packed with insights from years of experience. Make skincare that is fresher, far superior and above all, safe and healthy. You can tailor to your own specific mature, damaged or dry skin type needs.\nMore of what students have to say:\n★★★★★ \"I found here exactly what I'd been looking for. Working with easily available ingredients, home-made products that are fun to create and save me using store-bought cosmetics that may be expensive or contain harsh chemicals. The instructor is very nice and inspiring, and she explains and demonstrates everything clearly. I really appreciate that she says not only how to do things but also why to do them that way.” – Zdenka D\n★★★★★ \"Fantastic course! A lot of great information. I've been wanting to make my own skincare products for sometime and Elizabeth takes the guess work out of it and makes it look so much easier than I imagined. I can't wait to get started making my own recipes! Thank you for this great information!!! Highly recommended!” – Cathleen A\n★★★★★ \"I love the way Elizabeth tells you the benefits of the item, then shows you how to make it, and then applies it to her own skin to show you how. She's very calming and knowledgeable. I love her courses. I learn so much and feel confident that I can make everything she shares with us.” – Jay C\nYou have lifetime access to the course so you can take as long or short as you wish to go through the material. You can replay the videos at anytime using the course as an ongoing reference. You also have a 30 day money back guarantee.\nENROLL NOW FOR THE BEST SKIN OF YOUR LIFE!",

Also removing any overgrown cuticles or descaling and removing hard calluses and debris from one’s feet.\n\n\nWhat is a \"Rough Feet\" pedicure?\nA rough feet pedicure is a technique I have used in the past when working on rough feet. As a nail technician or anyone who is doing a pedicure service whether at home or in the nail salon you will not be awarded clients or family members with the best quality feet.\nIn most circumstances when you are asked to do a pedicure, it is because a person’s nail cuticles have overgrown, and they need to remove and replenish the nail polish on their feet and descale the excess dried callus forming alongside and underneath their feet.\nIf you have ever encountered hard feet you will know once you see them, the toenails are sometimes, deformed or discolored, one toenail is bigger than the other, sometimes frail, uneven, hard, or may look unnatural.\n\n\nOnychosis is a term medically used to refer to nail disease and while some types of nail disorders should be treated by a doctor during treatment the client should keep his or her feet clean and healthy so the treatment to treat onycholysis will work.\nCertain toenail conditions also are caused by trauma to the toenail and in some circumstances, your job may be causing you injury to your toenails.\nSome construction workers, truck drivers, and in-office jobs can contribute to your developing Onychosis\nDoing a hard feet pedicure will increase your chances of getting better quality feet, or just keep your feet clean and smooth and keep fungus and nail diseases away.\n\n\nThis Pedicure Master Class will cover all you need to know about doing a professional pedicure correctly so you can improve your prior pedicure technique.

We use a holistic approach to achieve the desired results. The benefits of improvements in sleep being a specific example. This will be discussed in detail throughout the workshop.

What consent forms  I need to give to the client before the treatment.\nDermaplanning involves the removal of fine vellus hair and keratin cells from the outer epidermis by use of a surgical blade which must be sterilized. Generally, it removes the dead skin cells which often contribute to the dull look, spots and clogged pores. This treatment achieves a glowing, clean and fresh looking skin. The course is administered in both theory and live demonstrations. Among the things covered in theory is defining dermaplanning, its benefits, skin types, analysis, contraindication, and legalities. Dermaplanning is important since it leaves the skin incredibly smooth. It can also be used in pregnant mothers who are contraindicated to treatments such as chemical peels. It is a non-traumatic way of rejuvenating the skin.",

This method uses a thread, which pulls and twists unwanted hair until it lifts from the hair follicle. The results can last longer than shaving or tweeze, plus this method doesn’t cause ingrown hairs. Threading also doesn’t involve chemicals so, there’s no risk of a skin reaction, although you may experience minor pain or discomfort",
