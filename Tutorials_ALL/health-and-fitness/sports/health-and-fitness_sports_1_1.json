Join us here to learn the science-based tricks and professional advice from world's most experienced runners to make it a great experience even if it's is going to be your very first time.\nSLOW JOGGING is an exercise method elaborated by Prof. Hiroaki Tanaka based on years of research at Fukuoka University, Japan as well as his impressive running career. The term “slow jogging” was chosen for emphasis, that even though we are talking about a sport traditionally associated with moving fast, slow can be a perfectly good way to do it. It is a an efficient, healthier, and pain-free approach to running for all ages and lifestyles. Slow Jogging can be as slow as walking pace for beginners. It’s a great tool for those who have never really exercised and or are recovering after an injury. In this lecture we are going to talk about how the very same Slow Jogging training can help you build your stamina to eventually allow you to complete a marathon – the whole 42,195 km or 26.2 miles!",

Up to 95% of club tennis players tend to hit the ball late, either to close to their body or well passing the ideal contact point. If you do hit the ball late, you can never generate good effortless power just like tennis pros do and you will also be hitting balls much more out than if you did manage to hit the ball in front of you at the right place and high. From my years of experience on court working with tennis players I spent countless hours with them to fix this very common problem and at the end I got to the 3 most important steps that I now use to fix this late contact point problem. It proven to be crucial and always working well. When applying my 3 tennis tips to fix the late contact point, all of my players suddenly start hitting ball much more away from their body, well in front and at the right high, which ultimately leads to better and much more effortless tennis strokes.\n\nYou Will Learn\nWhat are the main reasons why you hitting the ball late.\nWhy is important to understand relationship between positioning, early preparation and keeping the right distance and importance of all 3 steps working well for you.\nHow to reprogram the late positioning and late preparation to fix this problem.\nExercises that will help you to be able to finally stop hitting balls late and be able to hit them nicely in front of you and at the right time.\nHow to practise next time you are on the court or a tennis wall and how to implement my 3 tips to fix this very important part of your game.\n\nFull Course Contents\nLittle breakdown of what you will learn inside this course.\n\n\nEarly Positioning\nYou will learn why is early positioning so important if we are to hit the ball on time and at the right place.\nYou will learn how to fix the late positioning and what to do in order to get used to a new habit, which will help you to finally see the ball well in front of you.\nEarly Preparation\nYou will learn and will know how to also prepare earlier for the ball.\nYou will be much more confident with more time before the actual impact and I will show you how it can be done just by applying what tennis pros do so well also into your game!\nDistance\n\nYou will learn correct distance between the ball and your body.\nYou will learn why is important to keep great distance and how it will help you to always hit the ball at the right place and right time, which will lead to much more cleaner strokes.\nExercises\n\nI will show you my favourite and most effective tennis exercises that work for my tennis players every day.\nYou will learn what and how to exercise to never hit the ball again and to finally have a ball always at the right place to be able to hit it the way you want to!\nWhat Some Of My Students Say:\n\"I've been training with Jan for while now and we initially started to work on my contact point as I was late in the position and I was hitting the ball not at the perfect place which prevented me from having a better strokes. After fixing all following Jan's 3 tips, Im now more confident where to hit the ball and I generate much more effortless power. Highly recommending this course to all as it covers exactly what Jan does on the court and it works very well.\"\nEnrique A., Barcelona\n\n\n\"I have applied Jan's 3 tips as I struggled with my forehand and he told me I was hitting a ball a bit late and next to my body. So we worked on it while I trained with Jan in Barcelona and then I keep going following his simple 3 steps that anybody can apply into their game. Really good and simple tips that if done correctly over the time all improves and I now have a early contact point and I generate much more power as its easier to hit the ball now than ever before!\"\n\nJanne V., - Finland\n\n\n\"I applied Jan's 3 tips to fix my contact point as I was hitting ball late with my arm bend and not fully stretched and it worked for me already in about 2 weeks time after applying all Jan talks about and shows in his course. Its working well as Jan has been using this on court for years, so to have it online and have access to his course and other courses is just great and feels like having Jan next to me on court. Thanks, Luis!\"\nLuis B., Mexico\n\n\nI will look forward to see you on the inside and to help you fix your forehand now!\n\n\nJan Metelka\nUSPTR Performance Pro Tennis Coach & Founder of PLB Tennis Method®\n\n\n*** THIS WEEK ONLY SPECIAL DEAL WITH 97% OFF - GET THIS PREMIUM ONLINE TENNIS COURSE for JUST 12.99 USE TENNISNOVEMBER at Checkout ***",

(Servizio, Cura, Rispetto - Service, Care, Respect):\nServizio is each athlete’s willingness to support all their companions on a path to technical improvement.\nCura is shown through the control exercised in techniques and in general attention to not harming our companions\nRispetto comes from self-awareness, awareness of our strengths and weaknesses, and leads to a correct way of interacting with others, in the awareness that we must not underestimate anyone, whatever their rank or experience.\n\nThe technical execution of movements requires specific control training.\n\n\nIn our sport, we do not use protection excessively as, by limiting freedom of movement, they also limit our freedom of expression.\nWe are not medieval knights in suits of shiny armour, we do not like masks as they hide the face of those competing in the arena, and we also believe that excessive protections may - even subconsciously - provide a psychological justification of an almost random use of the athlete's saber: “Well, my opponent is protected by padding”.\nWe do not intend light saber fencing to be an unsightly brawl. Control is at the very heart of truly mastering our saber and guarantees sensible, technical movements. This is why practising control is essential for us, and when practised correctly, it allows us to drive our blade forward at 140 km/hour in a fraction of a second, and then stop it exactly where and when we want.\n\n\nAll our members are appreciated for the quality of their performance rather than for any victory they may achieve. All genuine desires to work together for their companions and the society are also rewarded.\nLudoSport guarantees a real situation of equal opportunities for all Light Saber Combat athletes, where race, age, gender, different skills, social and economic class, political and religious beliefs are never prejudiced.\nUsing the meticulous educational research conducted by its Masters, LudoSport has also driven its own founding principles to the point of being able to accommodate disabled people, proving that sport can truly overcome any physical barriers.\n\n\nWhy is Ludosport right for you?\nRight from the start, LudoSport aimed to be an excellence in the realm of sporting innovation.\nThanks to the serene environment created in each of its structures, LudoSport creates a positive context for promoting and sustaining an ethical culture in sport, involving both its instructors and athletes, creating an atmosphere that stimulates consistent behaviour and respect for all those involved.\nThanks to its founding rules, the sport transmits the message of respect in all forms and opportunities. In this way, the sport is always dominated by behaviour based on fair play, sharing and mutual help.\nThe play and sporting sides of the sport offered by LudoSport are favourable to mental and physical well-being, protecting the athletes’ fundamental right to take part in a sport where competition is healthy and not negative for those involved.\n\n\nLudoSport favours and promotes socialising within its structure, both during the sporting activities and also outside of training, creating positive contexts for spending time together and giving everyone a role, regardless of the level of technical preparation they have achieved. The educational value of “merit” is also included in a social value, rewarding personal initiatives that are helpful for members as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

      "description": "Summary\nSports and marketing have long been entwined, and as the years go by, the connection between the two industries grows stronger. Marketing focuses on building solid connections with the consumer and making sure that the product or service offered provides value to consumers. Meanwhile, sports marketing focuses on building a connection with consumers through sports. Usually, a sports marketer is promoting a product or service towards the fans of a sport, athlete or team. Sports marketing relies on building strong connections with fans who take the place of regular consumers. Fans help to make sports marketing unique, and marketers should pay close attention to fans if they want to be successful.\nSports marketing has a long history, ever since the ancient Olympics sports were being used to promote towns and businesses. Now, thanks to the advent of radio, tv and the internet, there are more sports fans than ever. More fans mean more money, not just in the form of athlete wages but also in the amount of money businesses are willing to spend on endorsements. Modern sport has become full of big money sponsorships, and big brands can gain huge exposure due to being associated with a star athlete or major sports team. Red Bull, P&G and Heineken are all examples of companies which have gotten it right by achieving a lot of exposure through sports marketing.\nIn the future, companies will increasingly turn to the internet and social media, in particular, to help promote their brands. Social media has grown massively in recent years, and the future will see more sports teams, organisations and athletes than ever using the platforms to connect with fans. Social media gives marketers the chance to see the direct impact of their campaigns and choose athletes for sponsorships based on their engagement with fans. Sports will continue to spread to new markets, and increasing adoption of female fans can open up new avenues for sports marketers who aren’t afraid to step out of the mould.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\nWhat sports marketing is\nThe critical differences between sports marketing and regular marketing\nThe importance of fans and the differences between fans and consumers\nWhat are target audiences and why are they important\nHow sports marketing first began\nHow radio led to an explosion in sports fan numbers and kickstarted modern sports marketing\nWhy companies first started to invest in sports marketing\nHow new technologies helped to spread sports to global audiences\nWhat ambush marketing is and how marketing continues to adapt to new innovations\nHow future trends will continue to shape the face of sports and sports marketing\nAbout the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching! I have proudly taught university courses in Switzerland, USA and Brazil. My career spans over 15 years in the sporting industry with jobs at the London Olympic Bid Committee, UEFA, CSM and TEAM Marketing. I possess a Master Degree in Sports Management and an Executive Education diploma at Harvard Business School on The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. I hope that throughout this course you are able to have a wonderful learning experience! Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any queries.\n\n\nWhy Choose This Course?\nThis course has been developed to broaden your understanding of sports marketing and the ways it has affected the sports industry over time. If you’re looking to start your career in the industry and would like to increase your knowledge, this is a great place to start. We’re not going to bore you with irrelevant information and out of date figures. We’ve designed this course to be up to date and filled with essential information that will help you to understand sports marketing better.\nIn modern times, marketing has become interconnected with the sports industry itself as it’s grown and developed. The sports industry is incredibly broad and continues to grow each year, both in terms of overall revenue and in total spending. As the numbers grow, so too does the need for sports marketers to be smarter and better prepared. This course is an excellent step in the right direction for you becoming a better and more rounded sports marketer who can adapt to changes. Even if you don’t plan to work directly in sports marketing, learning the foundations of the subject is a great way to improve your general knowledge of how things work in the industry.\nRather than focus on just theory and explanations, this course will help you to gain a deeper understanding by introducing you to real-world examples. Throughout the presentation, you’ll discover how sports marketing has been used both successfully and unsuccessfully. You’ll be able to examine lots of different examples of sports marketing which mostly come from the past few years, meaning they’re still relevant to today’s industry.\nOne of the best ways to learn is by looking at relevant case studies. Here you’ll be able to examine each example and learn about why the campaign was chosen, what made it a success and how that success can be replicated. Of course, you’ll also have a chance to learn about why a campaign failed and how to avoid making similar failures. These details can help you to plan or understand future campaigns during your own career.

      "description": "Welcome to this new course on Backbends, Chest and Heart Openings!\n\n\nThis intermediate to extreme flexibility course is designed to work each part of the spine, in an isolated or complex way, alone or accompanied, with or without elements.\n\n\nIt's dedicated to every athlete, sportsman, dancer, yogi, circus artist, martial artist and those who want to work pleasure from the body, from the spine.\n\n\nHeart openings are a brilliant way to elevate energy and increase our internal energy! When we lean back, we also create strength in the back and we can relieve low back pain, at the physical level and also experience very intense sensations and emotions ...\n\n\nBack bends can sometimes cause pain and discomfort. In this course we learn to experience delicious back arches that promote spinal health and longevity from practice with Kai, a contortionist artist.\n\n\nThis in-depth and detailed course will combine fundamentals of anatomy, drills and postures, as well as other movements so you can feel the deep connections involved in the art of backbending.\n\n\nMany elements (backrest, blocks, benches, wall ...) can be used to deepen your practice, as well as a partner to open the heart and share intense, challenging and pleasant moments.\n\n\nLike any flexibility pose, a backbend requires awareness raising and activating muscle groups in a coordinated and intelligent way.\n\n\nThe feet, legs, hips, shoulders, neck, arms and hands, and obviously the heart, mind, and breath will be observed and adjusted.\n\n\nThis comprehensive course will help you create a strong and satisfying backbend suitable for your body by detailing each part of each pose, step by step, with proper breathing.\nWhat are the benefits of back bends, or front body stretches, on a physical and emotional level? We go through some fundamental principles and techniques.\n\n\nOur spine is an incredible structure of strength and flexibility. Strong bones and large muscles give us structure and protect sensitive nerves, while flexible ligaments and tendons allow the spine to move in all different planes.\n\n\nWith regular backbends we can help protect this wonderful balance by increasing mobility while strengthening the supporting muscles around the skeleton.\n\n\nBack Bend for a Stronger Back and a Fuller Life\n\n\nThe back bends are some of the most difficult flexibility poses to perform for the body and for the emotional aspect, as they require great flexibility and balance. However, while difficult, once learned correctly, push-ups provide a myriad of benefits, ranging from emotional freedom to soul healing.\n\n\nOne of the most notable benefits of back bends is relief from anxiety and stress. By deeply opening the frontal area of the body, the muscles and joints release accumulated stress that crystallized as a physical tension, a knot, a sore spot.\n\n\nWhile one is in a fairly rounded backbend posture, the kidneys are internally massaged, draining blood from the organs. When that stagnant blood is released, a new flow of oxygenated blood returns to the kidneys, flushing out the toxins.\n\n\nOn a subtle level, backbends are said to open up specific energy channels (chakras) in the body, which help to release energy blocks and facilitate healing at the mind, emotional body, and soul levels.\n\n\nFor many, backbends can seem overwhelming due to the intense opening of the core. However, by gently entering each pose and listening to the body's response, you can safely experience the profound effects, and gradually the pleasure and heartache are transformed into ecstatic sensations.\n\n\nIn this course, we open bodies and hearts.\n\n\nWe thoroughly investigated poses like the bow, camel, full wheel, and dancer that seem so challenging, yet feel so good.\n\n\nBackbends are the relief of our daily life\n\n\nWe spend hours a day working diligently at our jobs, traveling from point A to point B and lovingly caring for others. Increasingly, we spend our time bending over keyboards, telephones, steering wheels, and even our children.\n\n\nEven when it's cold, our shoulders are even more rounded to protect us from the cold. Combined, all these stooping have the unintended consequence of turning in on ourselves and closing the heart. This affects us not only physically, but also emotionally.\n\n\nPhysically, rounding your back tightens the muscles in the back of your neck and shoulders, increasing the likelihood of tension headaches and back pain. Additionally, as the shoulders round forward, this compresses the space around the heart and chest, making it difficult not only to breathe deeply and deeply, but also restricting blood flow to our vital organs and glands, increasing our risk of disease.\n\n\nOn an emotional level, this \"rounding\" creates a barrier around the heart. We can settle into patterns in which we distrust ourselves and others, as well as decrease self-confidence and experience a disconnect from others.\n\n\nBackbends open the heart chakra, increasing our sense of well-being, confidence, and connection to the world around us.\n\n\nOur backs are designed to flex not only forward, but backward as well. This is how our bodies are designed.\nIn our complete backbend course, you will discover the art of opening the heart: we will breathe through a flow of intelligently designed poses that will target the muscle groups that will allow your back to bend more easily in poses such as the Wheel, the Bow, the Dancer, the Camel, the Scorpion, the Lobster, the Little Table ...\n\n\nWe will introduce accessories to help us experience poses such as the spider or wheel, the dancer and the royal palomea. All of this will be done in a friendly, scientific, neat, and safe manner, encouraging discussion and experimentation.\n\n\nThis course is intended for yogis, practitioners of Dance, Circus, Gymnastics, Athletes and Artists. basic / intermediate to advanced level looking to expand their practice and deepen their connection with these postures.\n\n\nCome curious, with a pencil and a notebook, and a bottle of water.\n\n\nEnter with an open mind and you will leave with an open heart.\n\n\nI can not wait to see you!\n\n\n\n\nClick on the button \"Buy the course\" and we'll see you right away in the course!",

      "description": "Taping for All - Newbie Guide to Sports Injury Management, Taping and First Aid\nAre you a Sports Coach?\nA Personal Trainer?\nA parent with sporty kids?\nA professional or amateur athlete?\nAn inspiring physiotherapist?\nClueless on taping or how to deal with a sports injury on your own?\n\n\nThen this course is for you!\n\n\nWhat is Kinesiology Taping?\n\nKinesiology Tape is used to sports and relieve pain in muscles, joints and/or ligaments. It holds properties that support the reduction of swelling and it also aids recovery and mobility. This is a tape that has been around for ages. Initially, when it came onto the market people thought it was a complete gimmick. How can tape make such a big difference to an injury or bruising?\n\nHowever, a tape that's been around for over 40 years can't be a gimmick -- it definitely works. If you've watched any major sporting event, you will find at least one athlete covered in a spider web tape of blue or pink or black. Top athletes use it to aid recovery, and so can you.\n\nHere are some of the following brands of taping that I recommend:\nMX Tape\nClub Physio Tape\nK60 d3 - HiTech Therapy\nBSN\nKinesio Tex\n\nIf you look closely at a piece of kinesiology tape, you will see that some sections have glue and other sections don't have glue. These are done in wave patterns. The idea of kinesiology is to lift the skin every so slightly so that the body can do its own healing process. Injuries cause compression on your blood vessels, lymph and nervous system which limits the body from healing itself. The kinesiology tape relieves the compression to cascade the healing process.\n\nThere are many methods used to activate this correctly, with many different taping techniques and patterns. In our Sports Injury Management and Taping for Complete Beginners Course, you will be taught exactly what methods you need to use for different kinds of injuries.\n\nIn Module 1, Ankle Injuries would hold the main focus.\nIn Module 2, Lower an Upper Leg, Knees and Pelvis would be focused on.\nAnd Lastly, In Module 3, Shoulders, Elbows, Hands and Fingers.\n\n\nBy the end of the course you should be able to tape, manage and help aid the recovery of some of the more basic sports injuries.\n\n\nThis course is designed for the Complete Beginner who wants to become knowledge in the field of Sports Injuries.\nMost of the time in order to gain this knowledge you would need to do extremely expensive courses or first aid practicals which often only cater for people who are already working in Sports Injury Management Fields or even more, you would need to get a degree in Physiotherapy. That is why I want to make this information more accessible to the public so that you can help your clients, children, friends and family or even yourself when it comes to a basic injury.\n\n\nNo need to rush to the physio anymore. You can handle it on your own.\nSo, take the course. Become your own Physiotherapist.",

      "description": "Summary\nThe media and professional sports have always had a close connection, with the explosion in growth of the sports industry over the past few decades largely thanks to the increasing availability of sports media. Newspapers, radio, television and the internet have each had a large impact on how sports are portrayed and the numbers of fans who can enjoy live sport. While the sports industry has changed a lot over the years, the media remains as important as ever when it comes to bringing in new fans and reaching existing ones.\nSports media really started to take off in the beginning of the industrial age as printing techniques were refined, allowing for cheaper and more accessible newspapers. Sports fans could finally follow the news of their favourite teams even if they missed the game and it wasn’t long before the telegraph and then the radio allowed for fans to experience live games through a broadcast. With the TV, broadcasting became even more popular and help to bring visceral live sports to more people than ever. Sports broadcasting makes up a significant part of the sports media industry and has a large impact on how sports are portrayed and viewed by fans.\nThe purpose of sports media is to bring sports to a wider audience and help drive engagement with sports. Live sports broadcasts are the most popular type of sports media, but fans also consume sports journalism, highlights, documentaries and social media content relating to their favourite teams, competitions and athletes. These all help fans to understand more about the sport and stay up to date with all of the news and latest information.\nJournalism is the practice of reporting on the facts of a situation as it occurs, bringing to light issues that the public should be aware of. Journalism depends on trust between the journalists and the public and as a result, it’s important that journalists keep to the facts and maintain high ethical standards. Credibility is established by using tone of voice, the right platform and establishing trust.\nSports revolve around the support of the fans, who have a different relationship to their favourite team or sport than the usual consumer-brand relationship. Fans display a far greater sense of loyalty to the sport they follow but sports brands and media still need to understand the needs of the fans and how to develop engagement with them. Fans now have more choices than ever when it comes to sports and sports media, so it’s important to deliver the kind of content they want on the platforms they use.\nRisk is inherent in all industries and cannot be avoided. However, those in charge of a business should understand the importance of risk management and crisis management. These are particularly important in event industries such as live sports, where there are large numbers of people involved. Risks need to be evaluated and managed and a crisis team should be set up to handle any potential crisis. A crisis communication strategy is an integral stage in managing a crisis, as it will dictate whether a company is able to protect its reputation and prevent the situation from getting out of control.\nSports broadcasting remains the most popular way for sports fans to follow the sports they love. Live broadcasts are incredibly popular and also form one of the main sources of revenue for many sports organisations. Broadcasts rights are sold to the highest bidder and can be very lucrative, they’ve also led to rising costs for fans. As a result, signal piracy is on the rise and broadcasters will need to come up with a solution to prevent it. Broadcasting has been around for a long time, but it will need to adapt to continue to thrive and compete with other forms of media such as live streaming.\nThe internet has the potential to change the sports industry as much as broadcasting did or even more so. Social media, over-the-top broadcasting and sports on demand have made sports more accessible than ever before. No matter where you are in the world, you can stay up to date with any sports competition and this has led to the biggest organisations and athletes gaining more fans in new markets. Digital media has also had a significant impact on sports journalism and sports marketing, forcing those working in these fields to adapt.\nThe media and journalists should always aim to abide by a set of ethics when reporting on sports, even if the stories they’re covering might not be as serious as those reported on by regular journalists. Ethical considerations apply in sports media just as much in the regular media and key issues for consideration including privacy, the portrayal of women’s sports and the use of social media.\nWith so much change to the sports media and communication industry in just a few decades, those working in the industry have had to adapt and change fast. The rate of change hasn’t slowed down, and the arrival of digital media has meant that the world of sports and sports media are now more different than ever. With virtual reality, free content and an increasing number of sports documentaries just a few of the emerging trends, the industry may change a lot over the next decade.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· The history of sports in print, radio, television and the internet\n· The importance of communication\n· The basics of journalism\n· What are features, interviews and editorials, and how are they used in journalism\n· The importance of credibility and how to produce credible communication\n· How to identify consumer needs\n· The difference between consumers and fans\n· The importance of engagement and how to build engagement with fans\n· Risk management and its importance in the sports industry\n· The different stages of crisis management\n· How to create a crisis communications strategy\n· How to avoid and overcome bad communication strategy\n· What are broadcasting rights, and how are they used\n· What processes go into broadcast production\n· The future of broadcasting\n· Social media and what impact it has had on the sports industry\n· What has digital media changed in sports journalism\n· How digital technology affects sports marketing\n· The basics of ethics in journalism\n· Ethically portraying women’s sports in the media\n· Ethical sports reporting in the digital age\n· How virtual reality can change the future of sports media\n· Free content and its impact on the sports industry\n· Why broadcasters are producing more sports documentaries than ever before\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

      "description": "Summary\nStrategic management is the process of setting and optimising goals, ensuring that the business is on the right track and that its core goals are being met. For any business or sports organisation, goals are crucial, helping the management and staff or athletes work together to achieve their shared targets. The overall objectives of a strategic management plan are to set realistic aims, put processes in place to achieve those aims, collect and analyse data on the organisation and use that data to improve the processes.\nStrategic performance management is used in both sports and business, helping organisations get more out of their resources while gaining a competitive advantage over other organisations in the same markets or competitions. The strategic management process is cyclical, with management regularly needing to reassess the aims of the business and continually using data to analyse performance and adjust the processes in place.\nThe sports industry is a highly competitive field, both in terms of jobs and competition between organisations. Most businesses within the sports industry now make use of strategic performance management to not only improve results on the pitch but also improve the overall business of the organisation. Anyone wanting to work in sports management, or any related field, will need to understand the theory behind strategic management and how it can be applied to a sports business.\nAs the sports industry has become more professional over time, there’s an increasing need for organisations to look for ways to get ahead of the competition. Innovation in training methods, new techniques, improvements in sports science and strategic management have all been utilised to improve performances and achieve better results. As the rewards for success have increased, so has the incentive for sports organisations to optimise their management and look for new ways to improve results.\nAll organisations should be looking to gain a competitive advantage over other businesses in the same market. This includes sports clubs, athletes and businesses which are all competing for revenue, fans and market share. To be able to gain a competitive advantage, strategic management is essential, and the executives or decision-makers need to understand how to form and apply effective strategy.\nTo continually outperform the competition and ensure longterm success, organisations must revisit their strategy regularly, assessing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This is known as SWOT analysis and along with human resources management, brand management and corporate strategy, forms the key components of a successful strategy.\nIn the sports industry, other areas also need to be assessed and optimised to ensure success. Sports organisations and athletes need to focus on scouting and hiring the right talent as well as optimising training methods. On top of this, motivation and well being are important aspects to consider. For an athlete to perform at their best level, all of these aspects must be carefully managed and controlled.\nWith new innovations coming into the sports industry all the time, organisations need to stay ahead of the latest trends to keep up with the competition. Just as data analysis and technology have changed how businesses operate in the modern world, they’re also changing how sports organisations work. To be successful in business or sports management, a good understanding of technology, as well as data analysis and future trends, is required. Long terms success depends on constantly innovating and adapting to changes in the market.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· What is strategic and performance management\n· The importance of strategic management\n· The importance of values to a business\n· What a mission and vision statement are and why they’re so important\n· What is SWOT analysis and what it’s used for\n· All about competitive advantage and how companies look for and gain an advantage over their competitors\n· Why sports are an important part of the community and community development\n· Methods used for training skills\n· The importance of friendly and exhibition games\n· How to build leadership, communication and teamwork\n· What are human resources\n· How sports organisations and companies scout for talent\n· Why motivation is important in business and in sports\n· The role of mental wellbeing and positive reinforcement in sports and business\n· Training to optimise performance\n· Injury prevention and support\n· How teams, coaches and athletes measure performances to improve\n· What is corporate strategy and what are the four components of corporate strategy\n· Brand management and its importance\n· How organisations raise capital and why\n· Growth strategies of successful businesses\n· How businesses measure and analyse data\n· How sports organisations measure and analyse data\n· What are brand equity and positioning?\n· What is brand management?\n· The different areas of digital marketing and its importance\n· The importance of social innovation and entrepreneurship in sports\n· Why creativity is important in sports\n· How organisations manage and plan for innovation\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

Whether you plan on working in the sports industry directly or take another career path in business management, you’ll be able to apply and make use of the topics taught through this course.\nUnderstanding the theory behind strategic management and what it means is necessary to succeed in a successful, modern organisation. As competition between organisations gets stronger, being able to understand strategic management and its importance in sports and business is essential. The course will establish the function of strategic management and how it relates to performance, letting you understand concepts such as mission and value statements and how they can help to centre a long-term strategy.\nYou’ll also cover the SWOT analysis method and learn how organisations measure and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses plus opportunities and threats. In any strategic management plan, a SWOT analysis gives managers clues as to which areas of the organisation they can improve, and which areas can be built on. The course will help you to understand each part of the SWOT analysis and how important it is in building and maintaining a competitive advantage.\nSports development covers the topics of creating and developing athletes as well as how sports can affect local communities.

This includes talent scouting, motivation and how to protect and foster the wellbeing and positivity of staff.\nIn sports and business, a lot of time and resources is spent looking for new ways to optimise performances and get more out of the available resources. The methods used will vary depending on the type of business but improving training methods, and measuring performances are highly effective. In sports, it’s also important for organisations to provide proper injury prevention and support as excessive injuries can seriously affect the overall performance of the team.\nCorporate strategy is an aspect of strategic performance management that can be applied to large organisations that are comprised of multiple businesses.

In this course, you’ll learn more about corporate strategy, including how it’s used, its importance and the different areas that make up the overall strategy.\nOver the past few decades, data analysis has become an integral part of business strategy. Modern businesses use data to analyse their decisions and drive future strategy. Data analysis can be grouped into four main categories which each have distinct uses and applications. The course will look at the different ways data can be used in business and also how modern sports organisations are adopting a data-driven approach to decision making.\nThe course also examines marketing strategy, letting you learn more about the influence of marketing on an organisation’s overall strategy. You will get an in-depth look at how brand equity and positioning work, including details on how brand positioning is applied and why.

      "description": "Welcome to the Applied Neuroscience in Sports Course\nUnlocking the Secrets of Neurotyping Training\nHello and welcome to the Applied Neuroscience in Sports course, where we dive into the fascinating world of neurotypes and their impact on training. Join us as we explore the intricacies of personality neurotyping and how the biochemistry of the brain influences motivation in workouts. Discover the art of tailoring training programs based on the psychological profile of your clients.\nUnderstanding Applied Neuroscience in Sports: Neurotyping Personality\nApplied neuroscience in sports essentially revolves around neurotyping personalities. Its fundamental purpose is to assess an individual's psychological profile and, based on that, determine the most effective type of training. Throughout this course, you'll learn how to define neuropsychological personality profiles and approach them on an individual level.\nThe Core of Training: Motivation\nAt the heart of both training and life lies motivation. If your client or athlete isn't motivated by the exercises you prescribe, they won't give their 100% during the training session. That's why determining an individual neuropsychological personality profile is crucial. It enables you to understand who thrives on training intensity, who prefers high-volume training, who benefits from exercise variations, who enjoys training with a sense of feel, and who prefers structured prevention training.\nNeurotyping Basics: Decoding Your Personality Chemistry\nNeurotyping is essentially a personality assessment that helps uncover your individual dominance of neurotransmitters and the traits you possess. These traits dictate the type of training regimen that works best for you, both mentally and physically. It's all about individualizing training by using neurotyping to promote progress, avoid fatigue, maintain motivation, and steer clear of stress overload and injuries.\nDiscovering Your Neurotype: The Road to Progress\nNeurotyping is discovered through an understanding of neurotransmitters in your brain and their roles. It's based on Kloninger's temperament and character inventory, which essentially compares neurotransmitter levels with the presence of different personality traits. There are five neurotypes: 1A Warrior, 1B Athlete, 2A Enthusiast, 2B Artist, and 3 Thinker.\nThe Impact of Central Nervous System Chemistry\nThe chemistry of your central nervous system and brain influences everything, from your motivation to your tolerance for training loads, preferred dietary choices, and the types of exercises that work best for your mind and body, promoting maximum progress.\nJoin Us on This Journey of Self-Discovery and Progress\nWelcome to the course that unveils the secrets of Applied Neuroscience in Sports, guiding you through the intricacies of neurotypes and empowering you to tailor training for optimal results. Join us as we embark on this journey of self-discovery and progress.",

Built on sophisticated algorithms, generative AI leverages large-scale data sets and deep learning models, particularly neural networks, to identify patterns and recreate human-like outputs. Among the most notable generative AI models are transformer-based architectures like GPT and GANs, which have revolutionized creative and analytical processes.\nGenerative AI operates by learning from a given dataset during a training phase, where it identifies relationships and features within the data. It then uses this understanding to generate new, plausible content that adheres to the learned patterns. For instance, in text generation, models like GPT can produce coherent and contextually relevant passages that mimic human writing. Similarly, GANs, used in image synthesis, consist of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that work in tandem to create and refine realistic visuals.\nAs generative AI continues to evolve, it holds the promise of fostering unprecedented innovation while reshaping industries and human creativity. Its success lies in striking a balance between its transformative capabilities and the ethical considerations it necessitates. By addressing its limitations and risks, generative AI can emerge as a powerful ally in solving complex problems, amplifying human ingenuity, and paving the way for a more connected and creative future.",

      "description": "Summary\nSports have existed for millennia, but the concept of sports journalism is still a relatively new concept. While sports news used to travel mainly through word of mouth, the invention of the printing press created a new way for information to be spread and in the 18th century, the first beginnings of modern sports journalism were formed. This practice would later go on to be one of the driving forces behind the growth of the sports industry and brought sports closer to fans all across the world.\nAs the years have gone by, new technology and demands from fans have completely changed the way sports journalism works, and the industry is currently in a constant state of change thanks to the development of the internet and digital media. In this changing industry, sports journalism has become more competitive than ever, and aspiring journalists are finding it harder to break into the field.\nTo have the best chance of making it as a sports journalist, you’ll need a strong understanding of the history of the industry and how it’s changed over time. Learning about the history of sports journalism is essential as understanding the past can help you predict how things might change in the future. It also provides context for the importance of sports journalism and highlights the fact that changes to an industry can happen extremely quickly.\nIf you want to become a sports journalist, you’ll need to understand and respect the ethics of journalism. All journalism is based on a code of ethics, as journalists are meant to report on the objective truth, providing a service to the people. While sports journalism may not seem as serious, it’s still important for journalists to understand and follow ethics to prevent bias and manipulation while also preserving the privacy of those they’re reporting on.\nIf you want the best chance of being successful as a sports journalist, you’ll need to know what kind of education to take and how to start your career. While a degree isn’t always necessary, most professional sports journalists have some kind of bachelor’s degree which helps them develop their skills in writing and research. When you first start out, you’ll need experience, and while internships are one of the best ways to do this, you can also write for your own blog or social media page to gain experience in writing and reporting on sports.\nThe five W’s are one of the most important things any journalist must consider when researching and writing any type of news story. These questions help to find out the facts of the story and should always be presented to the reader or viewer to help explain the situation in the clearest way possible. Journalists also follow a typical structure for each piece they write, usually presenting the facts and the lead first, to draw the attention of the reader.\nModern sports journalism also includes broadcasts with many journalists working directly with radio or TV channels. The responsibilities of a broadcast sports journalist are similar, but there are often stricter deadlines and more pressures from performing live. Interviews often form an important part of broadcast journalism, and any sports journalist hoping to work in broadcasting should understand how an interview works and how to conduct themselves during an interview.\nSports journalists should also know what a feature is and how to write a compelling feature that captures the attention of the reader or viewer. Journalists who want to write a good feature will have to find an angle, preferably one that hasn’t been covered before. Features include opinion pieces and editorials which are used to give a subjective view of a certain issue or topic being covered in the news. Any good journalist should be able to write a compelling opinion piece to try and convince the reader of their arguments.\nThe future of sports journalism remains uncertain, but with the growth of social media, online sharing and user-generated content, it will no doubt continue to change and adapt just as it has over the past few decades. New business models for online news and sports content are starting to emerge, and journalists are finding new ways to promote and grow their following. Any good sports journalists should be prepared to move and adapt with the times, and while things may have changed a lot, the demand for sports news and content is greater than ever.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· The importance of sports journalism\n· How sports journalism started\n· The beginnings of sports and sports journalism on TV\n· How sports journalism has helped the sports industry grow\n· The importance of ethics in sports journalism\n· What is bias and how can it be avoided\n· How and why some stories are manipulated in the media\n· The importance of preserving privacy\n· What education a sports journalist needs\n· How to build your experience in the industry when you first start\n· The steps to starting your career as a sports journalist\n· The five w’s of journalism and their importance\n· How news stories are structured\n· The importance of writing style\n· How content is adapted for online publication\n· The demands of broadcast journalism\n· How research and preparation for broadcast journalism works\n· How interviews with players and coaches are planned and set up\n· What is a feature?\n· How to find the angle for a feature\n· Writing a successful opinion piece\n· How editorial articles are written and for what purpose\n· The use of social media in promoting sports journalism\n· How technology is helping to innovate and change sports journalism\n\n\nWhy Choose This Course?\nWith the field of sports journalism growing more competitive than ever, it’s becoming increasingly important for those who aspire to become sports journalists to develop their skills and knowledge. This course aims to provide you with all of the information you need to get the best possible start to your career as a sports journalist. A lot of people think that simply having a passion for sports and knowing how to write is all that’s needed to be a good sports journalist, but nothing is further from the truth. To become a sports journalist, you need to understand how to investigate the truth behind a story, what makes a compelling piece of writing and how to keep your writing free from bias.\nIn this course, you’ll be able to learn all about the history of sports journalism and why it’s so important that fans can receive detailed information about their favourite sports. The course will look at the growth of sports journalism over the years and what’s changed, letting you understand the complexity of the industry. By understanding what’s changed in sports journalism over the years, you’ll also gain an idea of how it might change in the future.\nAs you progress through the course, you’ll cover lots of different topics which help broaden your understanding of how sports journalism works. You will also find out more details about the responsibilities of a sports journalist and how their processes work. The first stage of writing any piece of journalistic work is establishing the facts of the story. This course will cover how a story is researched and the steps that go into writing the piece.\nYou’ll get to learn about the ethics of journalism and how they relate to sports journalism. In the world of journalism, trust is the most important thing as the readers are trusting you to deliver accurate news, and the sources are trusting you to respect their privacy and confidentiality. Preserving this trust is important, and all sports journalists must be mindful of bias, manipulation and privacy to ensure the needs of the fans are met while also respecting the ethics of journalism.\nStarting out in any career is difficult, but as an aspiring sports journalist, you’ll often be dependant on gaining early experience in a field that’s hard to find jobs if you don’t already have some experience. Gaining an education is important, but a lot of modern sports journalism outlets don’t necessarily require you to have a degree. Online courses and experience alone can be enough to make a good start. The course will explain how you can begin your career and the steps you can take to build your experience while giving yourself the best chances of success.\nThrough this course, you’ll also be able to understand the demands and requirements of broadcast journalism and how it compares to working in print or online sports journalism.

      "description": "Summary\nAs the world of professional sports has become more competitive than ever before, organisations and athletes must look for new ways to gain an advantage over their rivals. Data science is one of the most important areas of a lot of modern sports organisations for this very reason. In short, data analytics allow teams or athletes to make better use of their resources and talents, potentially helping them to beat the competition.\nSports are often all about the smallest of margins, and if data analytics can help an athlete shave a few seconds off of their time or help a team discover top talent for cheaper, it can mean the difference between success and failure. In professional sports, revenues and profits are driven by success on the pitch, first and foremost. Athletes gain higher wages, and teams bring in more revenue from ticket sales and sponsorships, all of which can be affected by results on the pitch.\nData analytics seeks to collect, record and study sports data in order to look for patterns, areas that can be improved on and specific advantages. The use of data has grown across lots of different industries over the past few decades. Computing power and improvements in how we capture and understand data have led to large companies setting up their own data analytics departments.\nData analytics doesn't just help to identify strengths and weaknesses on the pitch but can also provide insights into how to improve a business through marketing and other means. With more modern businesses making the most of their data to address shortcomings and make the most out of their resources, sports businesses have been quick to follow.\nThe potential for data analytics has only improved as the technology has gotten better, and today, sports organisations use a variety of techniques to improve performances on and off the pitch. This course aims to provide a foundation on the ideas and methods of sports data analytics, showing how data science can be applied to the sports industry.\nMathematics play an important role in sports data analytics. Statistics form the basis of many data analysis projects, and the number of statistics collected in sports has increased over the years. Both fans and coaches have an interest in statistics as they help provide deeper insights into sports, as well as helping to predict outcomes through probability. Data science involves making and testing a hypothesis using data, and data analysts need to understand and apply various methods to achieve their aims.\nProgramming languages are at the heart of data analytics. Languages such as Python, R, Scala and SQL allow users to store, sort and analyse large volumes of data. These languages make it much easier to process, analyse and visualise data, which would have been done manually beforehand. A basic understanding of these languages is important, and all good data analysts should be competent in computer programming.\nOn-field analytics refers to the use of sports data to improve performances on the pitch, and it's become an important process in helping coaches get more out of their athletes. Today, coaches make use of modern technology, including wearable devices and cameras, to capture data during training and matches, which they can then use to highlight areas for improvement and make tactical decisions.\nAs well as improving athletic performances, data can be used by sports organisation to gain a competitive advantage in other ways. Whether it is through increasing fan engagement, scouting new talent or making strategic management decisions, data analytics has a wide range of applications off the field. Through carefully analysing the data of the business, managers can make better decisions that take the organisation to new heights.\nMachine learning and AI represent the future of data analytics, utilising technology in new ways to not only analyse data but also to predict future patterns and results. While the technology is still in its early stages, it has massive potential to completely change the face of sports data analytics, allowing coaches to predict injuries and helping prevent international match-fixing rings.\nData analytics has a wide range of applications across all sports, as we can see in examples such as the Oakland Athletics with sabermetrics and how teams like Bayern Munich have improved fan engagement and moved into new markets. There's also the case of the NBA, which has significantly changed how exciting its games are by making data available to all teams. All kinds of different sports organisations are now making better use of data than ever before, improving performances on the pitch as well as building fanbases and revenue.\nTechnology has improved a lot over the last few decades and is continuing to improve with each passing year. As new technology is developed and current technology continues to drive innovation, the face of data analytics can potentially change a lot. Areas such as the Internet of Things, blockchain and fast data are all predicted to impact the area of sports data in the coming years and offer new ways to collect and analyse sports data.\nThe sports industry is highly rewarding to work in, and as a result, demand for positions is high and there's a lot of competition. Finding your first job in the field of sports data can be difficult, but if you focus on education, experience and your professional network, you can make things a lot easier. To be successful, you need to show potential employers that you have the skills, knowledge and experience required to succeed. You can gain these through a degree, online courses, internships, and even working on your own personal projects.\nData analytics is more important than ever before in today's world, and sports organisations are increasingly relying on data when it comes to making important decisions. By studying this course, you have the chance to develop the skills you need to become a successful sports data analyst while also learning more about this fascinating area of the sports industry.\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n· What is data analysis, and why is it important in sports?\n· Statistics and their role in sports\n· What is probability, and how it affects sports\n· The basics of data science\n· Python for data analytics\n· Scala for data analytics\n· R for data analytics\n· SQL for data analytics\n· Video analysis in sports\n· How wearable technology is used in sports\n· How data can be used to model and predict performances\n· What is fan engagement, and how can it be tracked\n· The importance of data in scouting\n· How strategic management can be optimised with data analytics\n· Machine learning for identifying match-fixing\n· How AI can help athletes avoid injuries\n· The future of AI in sports\n· How sabermetrics kickstarted modern sports data analytics\n· Expanding into new markets with the help of data\n· How the NBA made use of data analytics\n· The impact of blockchain on the future of data analysis\n· How can the Internet of Things influence the future of sports data\n· Fast data and what it means for sports analytics\n· What education is needed to get started in sports data analytics\n· How to get experience in sports data analytics\n· How to build your professional network\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

      "description": "Summary\nSports management is the principle of organising and running sports and sports activities. It focuses primarily on the business side of sports but also on how sports can have a positive impact on our lives. In sports management, the economic and social effects of sports are measured and studied. The modern sports industry is worth billions of dollars and creates employment for millions of people. Sports management focuses a lot on how to improve the industry and how to maximise profits and success of sporting organisations. Someone working in sports management might be the executive of a professional club, a sports brand or a sporting organisation or league. Sports management is also a useful subject for sports coaches, event planners and any management role.\nSports have always been an important part of human society, and the sporting industry has grown to have a major economic impact on the world too. Throughout history, humans have used sports to have fun, demonstrate their skills and engage in competition. Sports allow us to engage our innate need to compete against others while also promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. Sports have always been popular with fans and now, thanks to advances in technology, sports fans are now able to watch sports whenever they like. The increased availability of sports has led to a rapid growth in the industry and the professional sports we see today are a direct result of that.\nAs the sports industry has gotten more professional, the need for effective sports management has grown. Sports have become more competitive than ever, and the margins for success are normally slim. This means that effective management is more important than ever, as it can make the difference between success and failure at the highest levels of sports. In the future, as the impact of technology and management practices grow, executives with a deep understanding of sports management will be in high demand. Through learning about how the principles of management relate to the sports industry, you’ll be preparing yourself for a successful career in the world of sports.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· What sports management is\n· What are sports and how did they develop?\n· What is ethnography and how does it apply to sports?\n· What is consumer behaviour and how do sports relate to it?\n· The impact of sports on society\n· The values of sports and sport culture\n· How equality can be promoted through sports\n· How sports and psychology are linked\n· Why integrity and ethics are important in sports and sports management\n· Ethical issues in modern sport and the future of sports ethics\n· What is strategic management and how can it be applied to gain a competitive advantage?\n· The importance of analysis in strategic management\n· What is corporate social responsibility and do sports fans care about it?\n· How mega events and sports can be socially responsible\n· Links between sports and economics\n· What is financial doping and is it fair?\n· The costs of mega events and are they really worth it?\n· The importance of sports sponsorship\n· What is sports development and why it’s an important part of elite sport and communities\n· Issues facing sports development\n· How can a sports development program be improved?\n· What is sports marketing and who is the sports consumer?\n· What is the marketing mix?\n· What is the product life cycle?\n· The importance of brand and brand recognition\n· What is market segmentation?\n· How technology has helped shape sports for the fans, athletes and coaches\n· What technologies are being developed to change the future of sports\n· The principles of management\n· The media’s importance in the sports industry\n· Why financial management and financial reports are so important\n· Where sports financing comes from and the risk management that comes with it\n· The importance of data analytics in modern sport\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching! I have proudly taught university courses in Switzerland, USA and Brazil. My career spans over 15 years in the sporting industry with jobs at the London Olympic Bid Committee, UEFA, CSM and TEAM Marketing.

Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any queries.\nWhy Choose This Course?\nThis course has been specifically developed to help broaden your understanding of the sports industry and how management practices can affect it. If you’re looking to work in any level of sports, a deep knowledge of the industry and how it operates is important. A lot of what you’ll find in this course covers real life examples of how sports organisations work and what makes them successful. While some course may be heavy on the theories, we balance things out by showing you plenty of case studies of effective sport management and the practices involved in the industry.\nIn modern sports, management is more important than ever, especially with so many sports clubs now being run for profit. As the sports industry grows, the need for effective management does too. Sports organisations are increasingly mindful of how their off-field decisions can affect their on-field performances. Management practices need to get smarter as competition between teams increases. The industry needs people with an understanding of the business side of sport more than ever as it continues to grow and develop.\nAll of the information in this course has been selected to give you the best possible insight into the sports industry and business decisions that affect sports teams, brands and organisations. As well as providing up to date examples, the theories and concepts are also chosen due to their relevance in modern sports business.\nYou’ll learn about the principles of management and how they can be applied to the sports industry. There will also be chapters on how to prepare and analyse financial reports and why accurate financial reporting is so important. There will be a chance to learn about financing in sports and why risk assessment is necessary for any form of investment. Financial implications of mega events, sports sponsorships and more are all discussed in detail, and you’ll learn about the link between sports and economics.\nThere will be a chance to learn about strategic management, the competitive advantage and how a strategic management plan be formulated for success. Strategic management is how modern businesses plan to make better use their resources and time, gaining an edge over the competition and increasing profitability and success. Now more than ever, strategic management is an important part of sports, and many sports organisations are focusing on strategic management plans.\nThe course also goes into details on topics such as technology and how technological advancements are helping to change the sport. You’ll see real examples of past, present and future technologies and how they’ve helped to change sports for the fans, athletes and coaches. The use of technology has wide ranging implications for the future of sports and sports management. This course is a great way to study and prepare for those future trends.\nOf course, sports management is more than just the financial aspects. There are multiple chapters here where you’ll be able to learn about the history of sports and how sports can create a positive impact on people and society as a whole. You’ll also be able to discover some of the challenges involved in balancing competition and fair play and why sports ethics are an important thing to consider.\nThis course presents a balanced and complete view of the sports industry and sports management as a whole. It can be useful to just learn the business side, but without seeing the whole picture, your understanding of the industry will be lacking.\nFor those who wish to build a successful career in the sports industry, a complete knowledge of sports management is important. This course is designed to give you a broad understanding of the topics being discussed and makes use of case studies to provide context.",

      "description": "Summary\nSports are a major part of society and have been around for millennia, helping us to stay healthy while teaching us teamwork and sportsmanship. These days, sports and entertainment are closely linked, with major sporting events being watched by billions of fans all over the world. The sports industry today is one of the world’s fastest-growing industries and is worth an estimated $500 billion. Around half of this comes from spectator sports alone, making it an extremely valuable and potentially profitable area of study.\nFor those who love sports and being a part of the action, there are few areas of the sports industry more rewarding than gameday operations. Directly involved in coordinating and organising the efforts of sports teams and organisations, those working in gameday operations play a crucial role in ensuring sports can be seen by a wider audience.

You’ll need to understand the pregame and post-game responsibilities of gameday operations staff and managers. The work of gameday operations focuses on ensuring that games go ahead according to plan and that the athletes and fans have everything they need.\nYou’ll need to know about the importance of communication and how gameday operations communicate effectively with the fans and each other. Modern sports are very different to how they looked just a few decades ago, and communication methods used today help to make things easier. If you want to work in gameday operations, you’ll need to know how to use modern methods to communicate and ensure that events go to plan.\nManaging staff and helping them work effectively is a big part of gameday operations and with any event, those working as managers need to be able to hire and train staff as well as motivating them. If you want to work in any aspect of gameday operations, you’ll need to know how to work as a team, working effectively with others and helping your team mates to achieve their goals.\nRisk management is critical for gameday operations, with managers needing to set up risk assessments and manage risk as best as possible. This work involves coordinating with other departments, including facility managers and security, to make sure that the event is safe, and risks are minimised. Gameday operations staff should also understand what master and contingency plans are and will need to know how to plan for contingencies in case of an emergency or a change in plan.\nThe media are a vital part of the sports industry and a big reason for why so many fans all over the world are obsessed with watching sports. Gameday operations are often involved in liaising with media members, helping to set up production and broadcasts plus arranging interviews and other media content for promotion. Every sporting event needs promoting to ensure that fans know when and where to attend and the media are often directly involved in this.\nGameday operations are often directly involved in both choosing a venue and ensuring that the venue is ready for the event. A lot of modern stadiums are multi-purpose and are used by multiple teams across several different sports. The gameday operations team ensure that the venues are fit for the event, supplying equipment, moving things into positions and ensuring that everything complies with regulations. Managing sponsors and hospitality are also critical responsibilities for gameday operations and help to prepare the venue for the event.\nMaking your first steps into the world of gameday operations and the sports industry can be difficult. It’s a highly competitive industry, and you’ll need to know what level of education and experience is required before you start. Experience is usually required, and many of those starting out look for volunteering positions or internships to gain that valuable experience. Knowing how to demonstrate your skills and experience in an interview is also useful, as this is an important way to stand out from the other applicants.\nThe sports industry has changed a lot of the past few decades as innovations in technology and techniques have introduced new ways to watch and play sports. These innovations have also had a big impact on how gameday operations staff work. We don’t know what the future holds, but it’s likely that technology will continue to adapt and affect the sports industry. It’s important that gameday operations staff understand how this process of change works and are mindful of future innovations.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· Pregame and postgame responsibilities\n· How to communicate effectively\n· The importance of communicating with fans\n· How to enhance the experience of fans\n· Utilising social media to communicate\n· How to hire volunteers\n· Leadership methods and their uses\n· How to work effectively as part of a team\n· Managing security and security risks\n· How to create master and contingency plans for an event\n· Effective risk management\n· All about press releases and how to write one\n· Public relations and what it involves\n· How gameday operations work with broadcasters\n· Social media and its uses in gameday operations\n· How to choose an ideal venue for a sporting event\n· The work of the gameday operations staff in preparing a venue for an event\n· Hospitality and its importance at modern sports events\n· Managing sponsors and why sponsors are so important\n· What level of education you need to work in gameday operations\n· Whether experience is necessary when you first start out in your career\n· How to find roles in gameday operations\n· How to prepare for your interview\n· Innovations and future technologies in gameday operations\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

It enables us to perform a proper turn, and understand our physical abilities. The turn has some key points- dropping our feet, gliding to the wall, rolling in our head and expiring air out through our nose (so we don’t get water in our nose, which is a very annoying burning sensation by itself).\nThe reason you get 4 workouts ( 12 workouts after repeating each workout 3 times) is that it takes 1.5 months to get used to swimming with less air.\nOri Sela is the founder of one of the biggest and most professional hydrotherapy centers in the world\nI dedicate my life to treat people and live a better life.",

This transition is also the hardest stage of any eSports gamers' career.\nLong time Evil Geniuses StarCraft 2 gamer Chris \"Huk\" Loranger mentions his transition and the hard work involved in pro gaming (from the article, \"Chris 'Huk' Loranger Believes eSports Is A Lot Harder Than People Think,\" GameSkinny.):\n\"I played StarCraft I and other videogames for a long period of time, but after high school I wasn't sure what to do with my life basically. I was going to join the US Military to help pay for school – and I didn't want to take out loans – one, because I didn't want to take out loans and two, because I didn't really know what I wanted to do anyway. So I was in the process of joining the military, I took the tests, I was on a waiting list, and StarCraft 2 came out. I was playing it for fun, and then I started doing good. I got an offer on a team for like $500 a month, and they offered to fly me out to tournaments for three months. So I said, 'What the hell, I'm waiting anyway, I can do this.' And since then, I've gotten better and better deals, and now the military is something I obviously decided not to do.\nIt's a lot harder than most people realize. You've got to be hard working. You have to be able to take criticism, and be able to be humble. And then generally, you've got to be pretty dexterous and smart, I guess, in some ways.\"\nThe purpose of this course is to give the aspiring pro eSports gamer a mindset in order to confidently make that transition. Become a Pro Gamer (eSports Athlete), or otherwise called after the book it's based on, Jumpstart Your Pro eSports Gaming Career, will provide you with insights, inspiration, advice and tools to gain a concrete vision on what it means to become a pro eSports gamer.

      "description": "Summary\nThroughout history, sports sponsorships have been a massive part of the sports industry. Many sports are completely reliant on sponsorships and for others, sponsorships make up a big portion of their revenue. With the global sports sponsorship industry estimated at being worth more than $45 billion, it is clear that there is a lot of value for both brands and rights holders in sponsoring sport.\nWhether it is through sponsoring an event, a sports team or an individual athlete, brands across the world see sports sponsorship as a way of gaining mass exposure and building their brand to a global audience. The very first sporting events in history relied on amateur athletes who needed sponsorships in order to dedicate their lives to training. This financial security helped athletes improve and get better over time and as the level of competition has grown, so too has the size of the sponsorships.\nAs the sports industry has rapidly expanded in the last few years, so have sports sponsorships. The arrival of new technologies such as the radio, tv and then the internet have all brought fans closer to the sport and given sports marketers new ways to reach fans. This has led to massive growth in the money companies are willing to spend on sponsorships, but companies need to understand how to use these deals effectively.\nSports have gotten saturated by marketing over time, and brands need to recognise that there is more to sponsorships than just buying views. A smarter approach to sponsorships needs to be taken to ensure that deals are being used effectively. Activating a sponsorship has become just as important as the sponsorship itself and brands that carefully plan out their sponsorships are much more likely to get a better return on their investment.\nWith technology continuing to improve and social media giving fans a closer connection to their favourite sports and athletes, sports sponsorships will find new ways to promote brands to fans. Sports are also becoming more inclusive to all types of people, and sports marketers need to focus on these new audiences to get the best possible results out of sponsorship deals.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\nThrough this course you’ll learn the following:\n· What is sports sponsorship, and how does it work?\n· Why do companies use sports to advertise their brands?\n· What types of sponsorships are there?\n· How did sports sponsorships first begin, and why?\n· How sports sponsorships have changed and adapted over the years\n· What role does sports sponsorship play in the marketing mix?\n· All about sponsors activation and its role in successful sponsorships\n· How do naming rights deals work, and what is their purpose?\n· The process of sports merchandising and how brands can deal with counterfeiting\n· How can a brand conduct market research the improve the effectiveness of their sponsorship?\n· Are sports sponsorship deals worth it for the sponsor?\n· What makes a sponsorship deal successful?\n· What factors can lead to a sponsorship being unsuccessful?\n· How technology is helping to improve sponsorships\n· In what ways is globalisation changing the sports industry and affecting the way sponsorships work?\n· What is digital sponsorship?\n· How social media is affecting the world of sports sponsorship\n· Future trends in sports sponsorship\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

Adult club tennis player from Israel, who came to train with me to work on his game. When we got into his serve, I realised he was very static at first and he could not transfer the weight into the ball to generate more power and control at the same time, and he was not using his whole body correctly, or in other words, his \"kinetic chain\" was off.. I showed him what we needed to start working on and we went through what pros do well and how we can implement my PLB Tennis Method into his serve. After only 10 minutes Roni and I started to feel first signs of his new serve. Roni said: \"I CAN FEEL IT!!!\" and that was the moment when the right \"kinetic chain\" starting to kick in...After some weeks now, Roni's serve is at the different level and he finally has the power and control that he always wanted to have on his serve.\n\n\nor lets take Michael…and his experience\n\"Been training with Jan before, and we worked on my serve. Jan showed me his PLB Tennis Method and how to apply it into my serve. I finally now use my whole body and I'm hitting ball at the right hitting area and I generate much more consistency than ever before. Jan really transformed my serve, can only recommend his online training program, as its as good as having Jan next to you on court! Thanks!\" Michael C., Florida\n\n\nand this is what Ken from Norway says about this program after completing it...\n\"If you lack power and consistency, then this online tennis training program is for you. Jan goes well in depth into details and how you need to use the whole body with his method to get those effortless serves finally in. Its a must have course for any tennis player!\"\n\n\nor Barcelona based Enrique and his experience...\n\"Jan always had a great serve, so to learn from him is just natural. He knows what needs to be done and will show you all in a very structured way. You will have to take action of course, but the Serve Formula with PLB Tennis Method is there for you!\"\n\n\nSo, can you imagine how this course can help you?\nIf you want to be on my \"list of successful stories\" then act now and I will give you special \"21 Days Training Plan\" To Master Your Serve, where is step-by-step guidance on what you need to follow and do to transform your tennis game...so what are you waiting for?

I've traveled around the world for soccer and been fortunate enough to work with top trainers and coaches from different countries. To be honest, over the years I've stolen their best methods and made them my own.\n\nOver the last 8 years I've been creating soccer tutorials on YouTube. I receive over 100 new messages everyday from struggling soccer players. I've probably been asked every possible question about soccer development and I'm extremely grateful for that because it's forced me to develop an incredible amount of soccer specific knowledge.\n\nI've taken all of this experience and put it into my own training methods. These methods have transformed me from a typical under-performer to a consistent match winner.\n\nTrain 2 Dominate contains the exact methods I use on a daily basis to keep improving, stay in top form, and win everything I possibly can.\n\nIt's basically spending 24 hours with me and getting private lessons about training, performance, recovery, mentality, nutrition, and much more.\n\nTop personal trainers usually charge over $100 per hour for personal training. That's actually the rate I was charging before I decided to take all of my expertise online.\n\n24 hours\n\nThat's $2400 of Value!\n\nTrain 2 Dominate doesn't cost anywhere near that much.\n\nFor some players, the methods in this training program will end up getting them a professional contract, college scholarship, or at least a highly successful season this year.\n\nConsidering the averages (US TODAY SPORTS):\n\nMLS Professional Contract - $148,693\nNCAA College Scholarship - $16,937\nUSA Youth Team Fees - $2,364\n\nONLY $199 wouldn't be a bad return on your investment\n\nBut...\n\nIt's not even $199\n\nIf you purchase TODAY it's ONLY $99\n\nPlus You'll Get 5 Free Bonuses\n\n1) Soccer Success System\n2) Healthy, Delicious, and Easy Cooking with Dylan\n3) Special Stamina Rub\n4) Pre Game Pump Up Audio Recording\n5) Private Member's Only Facebook Support Group\n\nI realize this program isn't for everyone and it takes a very intelligent type of player to know you can't put a price on the value on hitting your top form, becoming a standout player, or dominating every time you play.\n\nAnd seriously...\n\nIf you use this program you will have the\nBest Season Of Your Career Of Your Money Back\n\nPS - If you can relate to any of the problems highlighted on this page: Get This Program Right Now.\n\nHesitation, self-doubt, and procrastination are probably what got you here in the first place. It's time to change that. Have the best season of your life or your money back.",

      "description": "Summary\nThe global sports industry is worth around $620 billion, and its current growth outstrips that of the GDP growth of most countries. Sports events are a major part of the industry, and as sports have grown, so too have the events. These days, events are bigger, more exciting and bring in more revenue than ever before. Fans from all over the world tune in to watch some of the biggest sports with mega events like the Olympics bringing in billions of viewers.\nThese events all require dedicated teams of event managers, staff and volunteers to make sure they go to plan. With so many different moving parts, multiple teams of athletes, venues, and thousands of live spectators, a sporting event can be challenging to organise. That’s why qualified professionals who understand the industry are so vital.\nFacility management and sports event management are more or less two sides of the same coin. Both roles are critical for the success of an event and will each have different responsibilities and duties, before, during and after the event. For an event to go to plan, all of the staff have to be aware of the aims of the event, and there needs to be a coherent plan for achieving those aims.\nThis plan is formed long before the event takes place, and most of the work of the event manager goes into creating and optimising the plan. Any event will need a lot of care and attention to detail during the planning phase to ensure that the venue, hospitality, staff and risk assessment are all taken care of. Event managers have to create memorable experiences for the fans, but more importantly, they also have to ensure the safety of fans and participants.\nTechnology has helped to revolutionise sports. The radio, TV and then the internet have all made watching sports and sports news easier than ever before. As sports become more accessible for fans to watch from home, event managers have been tasked with creating new ways to draw in thousands of spectators to ever-growing stadiums and arenas.\nJust as technology has helped to improve sports for fans at home, it has many applications for fans watching live from the venue. Large displays, better seating, improved stadium design and apps have all helped to create a better match-going experience.\nFor sports to continue to grow and develop, sports event managers need a deep and clear understanding of the industry. Simply knowing how to plan an event isn’t enough, they also need to be able to learn from previous events and innovate and adapt as the industry changes. In a few decades, sports events have rapidly changed, and it’s hard to predict how they might change in the future. What we do know is that sports event and facility managers will still be required to put in the hard work behind the scenes to make them possible.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· What sports event management involves and the key skills that an event or facility manager must have.\n· Why sports event and facility managers are so important for the sports industry.\n· The differences between closed and open sports events.\n· How the Olympic Games are organised.\n· What are the differences in planning between one-off events and regular events\n· The differences between a single day event and events that take place over multiple days.\n· The requirements for a sporting event to be held successfully.\n· The stages that go into planning an event.\n· How facilities including stadiums, training grounds and arenas are constructed.\n· The importance of human resources in planning and holding sporting events.\n· Why the use of volunteers is so common in the sports event industry.\n· How staff are hired and managed to make sure the event is a success.\n· The process of bringing in officials and athletes to star in the event.\n· The importance of event hospitality.\n· How food and beverages play an important role in the success of a sporting event.\n· What corporate hospitality is and its role in the sports event industry.\n· How communication with the fans is the responsibility of the event managers.\n· Why event planners and facility managers should strive to create memorable experiences for fans.\n· The importance of risk assessment and management for economic, legal and security risks.\n· How a risk assessment is created and how risks can be minimised.\n· The importance of master and contingency plans.\n· Why sponsorships are such a big part of the sports event industry.\n· What companies get out of sponsoring sports events.\n· How to find and secure the right sponsor for a sporting event.\n· What social responsibility is and its role in the sports industry.\n· Whether sporting events are doing enough to be sustainable.\n· The ways sporting events are making an effort to be more sustainable.\n· How technology can change how sports events take place and their impact on fans.\n· How might events such as the COVID-19 pandemic affect the sports event industry and why the industry needs to be adaptable.\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

I possess a Master Degree in Sports Management and an Executive Education diploma at Harvard Business School on The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. I hope that throughout this course you are able to have a wonderful learning experience! Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any queries.\n\n\nWhy Choose This Course?\nThis course has been specifically designed to give you an understanding of how sports events are planned from the ground up. If you’re aiming for a career in the sports industry, particularly in events or facility management, this course will prepare you and help to provide you with the knowledge you need to succeed. Perhaps you’re just looking for more information on what goes on behind the scenes of major sporting events, or you’d like to hold your own event. Everything you need to know is explained in this course.\nThe sports industry is worth billions of dollar,s and each year and thousands of events are held around the world each year. Sports events come in all shapes and sizes, with hundreds of different sports each with their own specific requirements. The role of the sports event manager is to understand these requirements and the needs of the spectators and make sure everything comes together.\nTo give you a broader idea of sports event, several key areas are discussed, but there is also a chapter that explores three case studies in detail. You will see real examples of three very different sporting events and how the planning process differed for each one. You’ll see the effects that sports events can have on the local area, on the fans and on the people taking part. It’s important for sports event managers to consider the social effects of the events and what it means for the wider sports community.\nThis course uses lots of real examples to help you to understand the theories explained throughout the chapters. Each chapter will give you an insight into a different area of event management. You’ll discover all the different types of sporting events, including multi-day events, one-off events and open events and their counterparts. You’ll learn the challenges and requirements involved in the planning stage of each and what it takes for a sports event manager to successfully hold each event.\nYou’ll also learn about event feasibility and what goes into the early planning stages of the event. This includes how an event chooses its aims and the way that the aims of the event will shape much of the planning phase. This also includes learning about how facilities are constructed and how sports events need to consider certain areas when designing and constructing new arenas and stadiums.\nThe course will also explain the role of event managers in hiring and managing staff, creating memorable experiences for the fans and risk assessment. All of these are important areas, and the course will cover each with real examples and clear explanations of the work that goes into these aspects. There’s also discussion on event sponsorships, including learning why sponsorships are so important to the events and why companies pay big money to sponsor sports. The course even shows how a sponsor is chosen and the importance of selecting the right sponsor for the event.\nTechnology has been a major cause of the growth of the sports industry over the years, and the course covers how it is being used to improve sporting events. You will learn about how technology is being adapted to give fans a better experience in the stadium and how facility managers can make sports venues a more comfortable place to visit.\nFinally, the course also covers the changes that the sports industry may face over the coming years. Situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic have cast doubt over the future of many major sporting events, and event managers need to adapt to these changes. Part of being a successful event manager is being able to adapt your plan to new situations as they occur. This course will give you an idea of how these adaptations can be used to protect the future of sporting events and how fans can continue to watch and enjoy live sports thanks to the work of sports event managers.",

(not even mentioning the unnecessary injuries that come with it).\n\n\nWhen it comes to your Two Handed Backhand, by not following the right biomechanics you will struggle with loosing your matches over and over again!\nYou will never be able to hit those nice, crispy and effortless Backhand strokes and you will never reach the level of the game you would love to!\n\n\nAfter 15 years of working with club tennis players, here are some of the most common problems that players share:\n- They lack power and can't rely on their Backhand which leads into loosing confidence and matches.\n- They lack depth, as their balls are too short and their opponents easily attack them.\n- They don’t position themselves well, which leads into hitting balls late and with no power.\n- They don't know how to correctly use their whole body to generate more effortless power.\n- They don't know how to properly use their left arm and they end up pushing the ball instead of easily swinging it through. (case of right handers)\n- Their Backhand is way too inconsistent and they usually end up slicing when under pressure which leads into giving points away.\n\nIf any of those above now resonate with you - >>  you won’t be able to play those better players, you will never be picked to play in your Club's Team and you will not be invited to play Doubles match with the best players in your club!\nOn top of that, by not using right effortless technique - you will most likely get injured and destroy your knees, lower back and you will end up with a tennis elbow or shoulder injuries! (I have seen it, believe me...had so many players on court which had a same problem like you!)\n(that is a cruel reality, that most players are facing, when not taking the right action…)\n\n\nLuckily for you, there’s now a solution.\nLet me introduce you to my new “UNLOCK YOUR DOUBLE HANDER - TWO HANDED BACKHAND BLUEPRINT COURSE” - a brand new online tennis course to help every club tennis player unlock his full tennis potential on Backhand Side!\n\n\nRobert P:  \"This Two Handed Backhand Blueprint course has definitely exceeded my expectations.

I hold multiple sports conditioning certifications, and I plan on preparing you to train and stabilize your core to an elite level.\nHaving Core Strength and Stability is necessary for Balance. Balance allows your to produce strength and power. Balance, comes from stabilizing the core. Imagine trying to lift a couch, while standing on two volleyballs. Without stability, power and strength is impossible, and we are vulnerable to injury. Stabilization of the core, is like standing on a stable surface.\nWithout stabilizing your core, any movement could potentially cause injury, especially heavy lifting and playing sports.

      "description": "This course is comprised of several sections: the first section has two colleagues who work with athletes and coaches discuss their respective approaches teaching clients sport psychology skills, including Motivation, Arousal Control, and Mental Imagery. Sections 2-4 have a series of interviews with three athletes/coaches about how they use these approaches in real life, and Section 5 has a presentation Michelle gave on 'psyching up and psyching down' to Amersham-Wycombe College students in Dec 2015. Section 6 discusses how one might put together a Psychological Skills Training program based on the requirements of the sport and the needs of the participants, and Section 7 discusses a hierarchy of PST skills, and the concept of evaluation of PST training. Section 8 is comprised of two questions designed for you to give feedback to the authors, based on your perceptions of the effectiveness and usefulness of the content, examples and resources. There is no right or wrong answer - we value your feedback.\nThe course is designed to be a resource for teachers and students completing BTEC National's Unit 20 (Applied Sport Psychology), but would support many vocational and higher education sport psychology or sports coaching requirements.\nIf a student wanted just to know about the skills alone, completing this course would take about 2 hours, but video interviews with coaches and athletes are also included to aid the students' understanding of how to apply these skills in real life, so the total content for this course is about 6-7 hours worth of listening. These interviews would be useful for students thinking of creating their own 6 week psychological skills program. There is no formal assessment for this course.\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to create and evaluate a 6 week Psychological Skills Training session for an athlete, team or coach, using the skills described herein, based on knowledge of a sport's requirements, and taking into account the needs of their (hypothetical) client.\nWho is this course for?\n* Athletes and Coaches\n* Judges, Officials and Referees\n* Parents of athletes\n* Students of sport psychology courses at universities and colleges around the world, and\n* Corporate / Management personnel wanting to adapt sport psychology concepts to the performance of staff in business settings\nAlthough this course is designed to be used in a sports setting, however it could equally be applied to the corporate world where top performing businesses use exactly the same skills (such as having a vision of success, controlling nerves during presentations, building team cohesion, using effective communication styles, setting goals etc).",

        "This course is particularly written for British students undertaking Unit 20 ('Applied Sport Psychology') as it follows the BTEC criteria, but it would also suit any student studying Vocational or Higher Education sport psychology units",

This course is for anyone who has been wanting to learn Tai Chi, but can't get to lessons or finds the instructor goes too quickly for them.\nYou will improve your balance beyond measure and directing your mind onto the exact ways in which you are changing your balance and moving your body, acts to sooth and calm your mind: mindfulness and meditation.\nGuang Ping Yang Style T’ai Chi Ch’uan (Part 1, Movements 1 to 12)\nWelcome to Tai Chi for Absolute Beginners.  My name is Julia Williams and I am an osteopath and naturopath.  I have taught this sequence of Tai Chi movements to clients and patients over the last 20 odd years and find it invaluable as part of helping rehabilitate from back pain or other injuries or simply as a meditation and mindfulness method.\nEven just the very first movement in the sequence, which takes just a few minutes to start learning, is a complete exercise in body awareness and balance in its own right.  I strongly recommend, that even if you don’t think you want to learn the whole Tai Chi sequence, that you go to that first video and learn Strike Palm, Ask for Blessings.  It’s available free as a preview and I would love for you to learn and practise that movement; I know it will bring huge benefits to your body, mind, energy and life!\nAs I said, I am an osteopath, not a Tai Chi professional.  I have not spent years studying under a Tai Chi master and I am sure that my technique is not perfect, but I find that an advantage in teaching Absolute Beginners.  I know from my own, and from client’s experiences, that many learning resources for Tai Chi are not easy for an absolute beginner or for those of you with injuries or disabilities, or without that elusive natural ability to learn exercises or dance steps that other’s find effortless! Or even that you just have one of those excessively busy lives that preclude regular classes.\nClasses also often cater for several abilities and you can find yourself struggling to follow the movements.  Or you learn the movements, but without capturing the true essence of Tai Chi: the movement of awareness and energy.\nIn the videos that make up this course, I aim to take you through the movements step by step, feeling that essence of awareness and energy right through from the first few minutes.\n\nAt the end of the lessons, you will find several complete practice sequences as well as a practice session recorded in slow motion.\n\nI hope you enjoy your experiences!  See you in Strike Palm to Ask for Blessings.",

The term “slow jogging” was chosen for emphasis, that even though we are talking about a sport traditionally associated with moving fast, slow can be a perfectly good way to do it. It is a an efficient, healthier, and pain-free approach to running for all ages and lifestyles.\nThe key is what we call niko niko pace. In Japanese, niko niko means “smile”. Unlike traditional training, that requires concentration and effort, Slow Jogging is more like taking a walk, at the intensity light enough to enjoy conversation or, if by yourself, to just smile. For most beginners it means jogging at a walking pace.\nBut Slow Jogging is not just about the pace – it’s also an injury-free running technique, allowing safe beginning and efficient progress. This course covers everything from the introduction, basic steps with detailed explanation of the landing technique to the theory and science behind it.\nBy the end of this course you will be ready to start the exercise habit you will be looking and a life-long injury free jogging experience.",

      "description": "Summary\nSports agents represent their clients, athletes, in order to help them move their career in the right direction. Sports agents rely on their network of connections in the industry as well as great interpersonal and negotiation skills to get the best deals for their clients and help their clients to make more out of their athletic talents.\nBecoming a successful professional athlete requires a huge amount of dedication and focus, meaning that the best athletes often have less time to dedicate towards promoting themselves and advancing their career. On top of this, they may not have a comprehensive understanding of contract law, and this can lead to athletes being taken advantage of by professional sports teams and brands offering endorsements.\nThe job of an agent is to help their clients in off-the-field areas, assisting them in getting good contracts and making sure they’re aware of their value to the teams and brands they’re under contract with. Good sports agents can help an athlete to achieve their ambitions and set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.\nIn the modern world of professional sports, contracts and endorsement deals are bigger than ever. Teams and sports organisations are able to earn more money than ever through sponsorships and TV rights deals. The increasing value of professional sports means that athletes are more valuable than ever.\nThe increasing value of athletes means that professional representation is more important than ever. Some athletes have the potential to earn millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of their career. This high earning potential is also a positive for agents, who usually earn a commission from the deals they help their clients to sign.\nTo be effective, sports agents need to be highly knowledgeable across lots of areas of the industry. They also need to have a lot of different skills to be able to effectively help their clients in negotiations, finding the right contracts and promoting them. They make use of their network to build connections with professional teams and sports brands, ensuring that they can help their clients sign the right deals for them.\nAs well as handling negotiations, agents are also often involved in offering financial and even legal advice. Athletes have the potential to earn large amounts, but if they fail to manage their money properly, they may end up struggling once their career is over. Knowledge of sound financial management is essential as well as an understanding of contract law and potential legal issues that a client may find themselves in.\nMost sports agents will require some kind of licence in order to work legally in their preferred sport. The type of licence needed depends on the governing body of the sport and the regulations that are in place. Good sports agents need to be aware of these regulations as well as the ethical issues of representing clients. It’s important to consider the ethics of representing youth athletes as well as making sure that clients receive the right support once their career is over.\nMost sports agents have a formal education in sports management or something similar. However, many agents also come from unrelated degrees such as law, finance or business. A degree isn’t required to become an agent in most cases, although it does help in gaining a good foundation of knowledge in the sports industry. All agents need to be highly knowledgeable about the sport they work in, and taking a course in sports management can be a great way to attain that knowledge.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n· The role of a sports agent\n· Skills needed to be a successful sports agent\n· How to successfully network\n· How agents build professional relationships\n· How to handle rejection in a professional manner\n· How sports agents recruit their first clients\n· Market analysis and its importance when recruiting and working with clients\n· How to assess the worth of a client\n· Managing the weaknesses and strengths of a client\n· How to manage client expectations\n· The value of confidence\n· How to provide useful career advice\n· What is PR and how it can be used to highlight the strengths of a client\n· How to avoid bad publicity\n· Working with the media to enhance your client’s reputation\n· Creating a brand for your clients\n· Advertising for sports agents\n· How endorsements and social media work\n· Financial management\n· Athlete salaries\n· How bonuses and incentives are used in athlete contracts\n· Contract law\n· Complying with agent regulations\n· Assisting clients with legal issues\n· How to handle conflicts of interest\n· Ethics of handling youth contracts\n· Ensuring clients are prepared for life after sport\n· How to negotiate\n· Managing risk in negotiation\n· Avoiding bad negotiation tactics\n\n\nWords from the Author, Saam Momen:\nI have a true passion for teaching!

Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any queries.\n\n\nWhy Choose This Course\nThis course has been designed to cover all the areas of athlete representation. Throughout the course, you’ll gain an understanding of the work that a sports agent is involved in, including how they find clients, negotiate deals and advise their clients on key issues. The course takes a wide approach to athlete representation, covering all of the important areas rather than simply focusing on one or two key topics.\nThroughout the course, you’ll learn about how a sports agent has an influence over their clients and the sports industry in general. The course will allow you to learn the theory required to be a good sports agent as well as introducing real-world examples to give context to what you’re learning. This will help to give you a better understanding of the role sports agents play as well as seeing why they’re so important.\nIf you plan on starting a career as a sports agent, whether self-employed or working for an agency, this course will help to give you the foundation of knowledge you need to build your success. You can learn all the techniques that agents require to be successful and understand what it takes to thrive as a sports agent in a highly competitive industry. As you progress through the course, you will learn more about common practices and how sports agents can find the best talent and help them to secure the contracts they deserve.\nThe course begins by introducing you to the role of a sports agent, ensuring that you understand what they do and why they’re so important to the sports industry. You will learn the basic overview of what a sports agent does, including assessing and signing talent, negotiating new contracts, overseeing promotion and marketing of their clients and handling finances and legal issues. The course will also go over the skills needed to be successful as a sports agent.\nNetworking is one of the most important aspects of being a sports agent. Agents rely on their network for everything from finding new clients to helping existing ones. Being able to build and maintain professional networks is a vital skill, and an agent’s network is one of their most valuable assets. The course will explain how to network successfully and build relationships as well as how to sign clients and handle rejection.\nSports agents also need to be adept at analysing the value of their clients and understanding what they’re potentially worth to professional teams and organisations. The first stage of analysing the value of a client is analysing the market itself. Careful market research is needed to understand how much clubs are willing to pay and stay up to date with market news that may affect their clients. The course will explain how this process works and how agents assess the value of their clients and analyse their strengths and weaknesses.\nClients and agents need to have a good professional relationship in order to work well together. Clients have to be able to trust their agents are always working in their best interests, rather than thinking about how their clients can benefit them. There has to be a good level of trust between an agent and their client, with agents needing to be honest and managing their client’s expectations to make sure they’re setting reasonable goals. The course will explain how a strong agent/client relationship is key to success and how to help clients set goals while advising them on career decisions.\nPublic relations is all about informing the public on a topic. In relation to sports, PR is often used to improve the relationship between an athlete or sports organisation and its fans. Agents can use PR to highlight the strengths of their clients, helping them to gain more fans and improve their chances of a big contract. Agents use their connections in the media to arrange interviews and will also help their clients to avoid bad publicity. The course will explain how these processes work and highlight the importance of good PR for professional athletes.\nMarketing is just as important as public relations, allowing athletes to create a personal brand and improve their value to sports organisations and companies. A personal brand also helps athletes appeal to fans and can build their marketability, helping them to attract endorsement deals. You’ll learn how agents can assist their clients in marketing themselves and how social media and endorsement deals can be a way for athletes to increase their earning potential.\nSports agents often give financial advice to their clients, helping them to make the most of the money they earn and ensuring they have enough for retirement. Through this course, you’ll be able to understand the basics of financial management, how sports salaries work and what bonuses and incentives mean for athletes and their agents.\nIn many professional sports leagues, agents must be licenced and will need to follow regulations or risk fines and the loss of a licence. These laws are in place to help reduce the impact that agents can have on the game while also protecting athletes. Being a good sports agent means understanding these regulations as well as knowing other legal issues that may affect your clients. The course will explain the licencing process as well as giving basic knowledge on contract law and how agents can help their clients deal with legal issues.\nEthical considerations that affect sports agents include working with youth players, conflicts of interest and ensuring that clients have support after retiring from playing professionally. The course will explain each of these areas and how to avoid acting unethically while working as a sports agent. You’ll learn how to avoid conflicts of interest when managing multiple clients, how to represent youth talent ethically and why it’s important to provide support for your clients even after they retire.\nFinally, the course will teach you how negotiation works from the perspective of a sports agent. You’ll learn what you need to consider when entering a negotiation and what rules to follow if you want to be successful. The course will also reveal about risk management in negotiations, including the different techniques for managing risk effectively. You’ll also see how bad negotiation techniques should be avoided, including how to spot them being used against you.",

      "description": "When most of us think of jobs within the football (soccer) industry, the list is usually exhausted after the players, officials and coaching team. But behind the scenes are the inner-workings of one of the fastest-growing industries in the world comprising a vast array of careers that keep the beautiful game ticking.\nIf you are interested in getting management or operational roles within the football industry, you have a difficult job ahead. Football management careers can indeed pay very well, however, getting your career started and becoming successful can turn out to be more difficult than you think.\nMoreover, while getting a degree in football or sports management can boost your chances of success, you will need reliable information and strategies to be able to figure out the rules.\nSaam Momen is the creator of this course and has worked at reputable sport marketing agencies and at the heart of the European football (UEFA) and knows what it really takes to succeed in the industry. He has condensed years of knowledge together with some extensive study, research and conversation with other experts and turned it into an all-inclusive, informative guide.\nWith women and girls becoming more interested and involved in all aspects of football, employment opportunities are increasingly available for them in what has been a male dominant environment. This online course is targeted at both genders and the opportunities described within are available for males and females. However, there is a specific module where additional opportunities for women and girls can be found.\nThis course intends to break down all of the difficulties mentioned previously into practical steps you can take immediately and start to focus your career into the right direction. This is a rare opportunity to get your football management career started (or back on track), connect and access the best opportunities in the football industry, and get insights amongst other things of industry-recognised institutions providing educational degrees in football and sports management.\nHere are the key areas this course will be covering:\nNetworking: Networking is one of the essential tools for growth in any career and football is no exception. However, the rules are slightly different when it comes to football management. During the course you will learn how to locate the right networking environments within the football industry and how to seize the opportunities when you are faced with them.\n\n\nFootball Seminars: Football Seminars are ideal for networking opportunities. Insights on the best seminars available will be given.\n\n\nWomen in Football: Women and girls have long faced bias and discrimination that has seen a low representation at the top of the sport. These days, however, women are finding increasing opportunities to succeed in the football industry. We will discuss here the events, organisations and courses which help to increase the diversity and impact of women in football around the world.\n\n\nVolunteering: From Saam’s personal experience, this is the best way to start your football management career. He will be sharing recommendations about why, how and where to engage as a volunteer.\n\n\nPreparing for an Interview: A comparison of interviews for ‘normal’ jobs and those for jobs in the football industry will be found in this course. A look at the interview formats involved, the skill set that you should display, the questions you may be asked and the questions that you can be asking your prospective employer will also be provided.\n\n\nJob Fair: With Saam’s experience and extensive connection within the sports industry, he will introduce you to what is considered arguably the best football and sports job fair in Europe. This is a unique occasion to be face-to-face with the recruitment departments of the best football entities in the world, an opportunity not to be missed.\n\n\nCareer Websites for Football Management Professionals: Saam will be sharing with you some of the best career websites which in some cases host head-hunters focused on the football industry. Here you will also find a guide with over 500 job websites for men's and women's football in Europe.\n\n\nFreelancing: Yes, you can be a freelancer as a sports/football management professional. This course will show you how you can be free to work from anywhere you wish and take up multiple jobs at the same time.\n\n\nFootball startups: One approach to entering into the football industry is to create your own enterprise or startup. Creating a startup can be an effective alternative for some recent graduates or even those who are changing career paths to gain access to the sports industry using their current skills. Insights to the best ways on doing so are given.\n\n\nLiterature/podcasts: Continuous education is an important way to stay up to date with career trends in football and sports. Saam will delve into some interesting findings on how you can learn more about the industry from books and podcasts that he will recommend.\n\n\nBest Undergraduate Degrees: If you want to pursue an undergraduate degree in sports/football management and you don’t know which colleges/universities to apply to, information will be shared about some of the best universities offering undergraduate courses in this area. You can be sure that these are reputable institutions often preferred by sports recruiters.\n\n\nBest Masters' degrees: This is the hardest and at the same time easiest way to secure the job you are looking for in the football industry… and you will find out why in this course!\n\n\nExecutive Education: Want to learn more in-depth knowledge and how to super charge your sports analytics and technology knowledge?
