Aber wir gehen noch einen Schritt weiter - wir schauen uns nicht nur an, wie Ihr eine Ordnerstruktur anlegt und Eure Dokumente einsortiert, wir bringen auch Ordnung ins Bilder-, Musik- und Videochaos und sorgen dafür, dass Ihr nicht nur einen Überblick habt sondern auch Eure täglichen Aufgaben - egal, ob bei der Arbeit oder Privat - viel schneller erledigen könnt.\nVereinfache dein digitales Leben sorgt dafür, dass du bis zu 100% produktiver bist, deine Aufgaben schneller erledigst und endlich weißt, wo welche Datei auf deinem Computer zu finden ist.\nAußerdem haben wir uns noch die iCloud vorgenommen, um Euch zu zeigen, wie nützlich die sein kann, wenn Ihr zum Beispiel auf mehreren Computern arbeitet. Ein effektives Dateimanagement sorgt dafür, dass der Computer nur noch ein Hilfsmittel ist, strategisch günstig zu arbeiten. Mit der richtigen Struktur und den onboard Mitteln von Apple könnt Ihr dies aber auf jedem Computer tun - und so richtig viel Zeit sparen.\nIm Wesentlichen benötigt Ihr, um diesen Kurs richtig nutzen zu können, nur Euren Mac und seine Programme. Wir haben allerdings noch einige weitere Programme wie Songgenie, Covergenie und iFlicks eingefügt, die Euch helfen, Eure Dateien besser zu organisieren. Diese müsst Ihr nicht haben, sind aber von Vorteil, wenn Ihr z.B. Eure Videos mit Titeln oder Eure Songs mit den richtigen Covern versehen wollt.\nDer Kurs hat über 40 Lektionen und ist eher etwas, dass Ihr immer mal wieder ansehen könnt. So ist es eine gute Idee eine Lektion anzusehen, das gelernte umzusetzen und dann zur nächsten zu schreiten. Am Ende werdet Ihr von einem Computer mit einem Dateisystem profitieren, der Euch viel Freude bereiten wird und Euch Aufgaben viel schneller erledigen lässt.\nVereinfache dein digitales Leben verhilft Euch zu mehr Produktivität im Alltag und Beruf.",

Différents moyens peuvent alors être mis en place pour créer ce processus de transformation des données en informations. Je vous propose alors dans ce cours de travailler ensemble sur un cas pratique de transformation en utilisant le tableur Excel.\nL'objectif de ce cours est de concentrer les informations clés sur une interface appelée tableau de bord, ce qui permet contrôler mais aussi de prendre les bonnes décisions en se basant sur ces informations.\nNous allons ainsi voir ensemble comment traiter un ensemble de données brutes pour les exploiter sur Excel, ensuite, nous allons créer des indicateurs et des éléments graphiques pour mieux visualiser l'information, mais surtout pour avoir la capacité de prendre les décisions rapidement.\nCe cours est basé essentiellement sur un cas pratique réalisé de A à Z. Vous allez suivre à travers les vidéos toutes les étapes pour arriver au résultat de la vidéo de présentation.\nNous allons dans une première étape mener les analyses à travers les tableaux croisés dynamiques qui nous faciliteront cette tâche. L'étape numéro 2 consistera à mettre en page le tableau de bord qui rassemblera tous les graphiques générés dans l'analyse. En étape 3 nous mettrons en place les segments de filtre pour avoir cette possibilité de filtrer les données suivant le besoin et enfin nous travaillerons sur le style du tableau de bord.",

      "description": "Did you know that as an iPhone user, you're likely spending over $1,000 a year in carrier fees, apps, and accessories? What's worse is that most people are barely scratching the surface in terms of using their iPhone's capabilities. I don't know about you, but if I'm spending $1,000 a year on something, I would want to get my money's worth.\nThat's where this course comes in. I've designed this video series to help you master your iPhone and dramatically increase your productivity.\nImagine being able to cut down the time it takes to do 90% of your most common tasks.\nImagine knowing tricks that the vast majority of iPhone users don't know.\nImagine becoming a real-life iPhone ninja.\nI've created over 2 hours of step-by-step video content to take you to that level.\nThe course is broken up into 8 sections covering basic tips, built-in apps, Siri tricks, productivity apps, apps for freelancers and salespeople, and accessories for maximizing productivity.\nHow did I come up with the price of $47?\nAfter the course launched, I got a couple of emails asking me to justify the price. For courses I create, I like to give at least 10 times the value of what you paid. So the math goes like this: if this course saves you 1 hour of time a week (conservative estimate), that equals 52 hours a year you've gained. If you make at least $20 an hour, that additional free time is worth at least (52 hours X $20) $1,040. $1040 divided by 10= $104. I just made it $47 to keep it under $50 and give you 20x the value :-)\nAnd who am I?\nI'm the Editor in Chief of iPhone Life magazine, one of the largest print publications in the world dedicated solely to iPhone and iPad users. You can find iPhone Life magazine in Barnes & Noble, Walmart, Hudson News locations at major airports, and many other newsstands in over 60 countries.\n***As a bonus, every member of the course will get a free issue of iPhone Life magazine*** Just follow the instructions in the last lecture of the course to redeem it.\nTo get started with your iPhone ninja training, tap on the \"Take This Course\" link.",

      "description": "[Last update: 7 Jan. 2025\nadded new lecture on Cinematic Mode\nupdated lecture to show how to apply same transition to multiple clips at once]\n\nJoin the more than 13,000!!! students from over 140 countries who enrolled in this bestselling course!\nDo you want to create a short cool video of your family vacation?\nDo you want to create an amazing trailer of a fun day with friends?\nDo you need to create a short movie for work to promote a product or explain some concepts?\nThis course will give you all the tools to accomplish this in iMovie!\nTHIS COURSE WAS CREATED INSIDE THIS COURSE!\nThere is no similar iMovie course available anywhere.  Everything you need is here.\nI used iMovie to create this iMovie course and in the course I show how I built different elements of this course itself!\nEven though I use the more professional movie editor Final Cut Pro X in my work, I used iMovie in this course to prove that everything I did is actually possible to achieve with this apparently simple application.\n\nIf you have a Mac, you most certainly have iMovie or can download it, probably even for free.  Maybe you've even used iMovie before.\nBut do you know everything there is to know about iMovie?\niMovie was especially designed to be a very easy to use movie editor.  And it is.  But it still packs a ton of features.  Most people aren't aware of the breath of functionality that is hidden inside iMovie.\nIn this iMovie course I will cover everything you need to know in order to master this application completely.  Even if you've already used iMovie before, after taking this course you'll be able to accomplish things you didn't even know were possible with such a \"simple\" application.  And you will certainly wow friends and family or your co-workers with your works of art.\n\nThis course is meant for all levels, from beginners to advanced users.\nFor beginners: because I explain everything.  You need no prior knowledge before taking this course.  And after finishing this course you will know everything about iMovie and you'll be able to produce amazing movies and trailers, with movie clips, photos, transitions, titles, backgrounds and maps, with video and audio effects, using themes, etc.\nFor advanced users: because this course has tons of PRO lectures.  I will show you how to overcome and work around many of iMovie's limitations and help accomplish many things that iMovie's designers and developers never meant you could even do with iMovie.  Just check the list of PRO lectures (they're all marked \"PRO\" at the beginning of their name) and see for yourself.\nBecause I give so much information, this course is about 11 hours in length!\nYou can choose to view all the lectures and get the most out of it.\nBut you can also decide to view this course as a reference.  The lectures are clearly organized in logical sections and you can decide to only take those lectures that you want to take.  Except for the PRO lectures, most lectures are self-contained so that you could understand each subject in each lecture without having to view previous lectures.  And if you do find yourself not understanding something, just find the lecture that explains that concept.  So you can watch anything you want, in any order that you want.\nWith Udemy's 30-day guarantee, you can't lose.  But I'm certain that everyone will find enough new information in this course to make it worth.\nWhat this course is not:\nI will not teach you how to shoot your footage.  That may be part of a different course, but this course only focuses on video editing in iMovie.\nI will not give you ideas on what movies you should make.  The creative process should come from you.  I will show you all the tools and techniques you could use in iMovie and chances are these will spark ideas in your mind for you to pursue in your movie creation.\nThis course only covers iMovie for the Mac and not iMovie for iOS, even though obviously many concepts are similar.  The UI is clearly different.  I may add a section in the future about moving a movie from iMovie for iOS to iMovie for Mac so you could start editing on your iOS device and then continue editing on the Mac.\niMovie has a small functionality called App Preview which is meant for developers to create short movie app previews to be put on the App Store.  Basically it only adds a few additional elements you could use in your movies. I will not cover this feature.  Maybe I'll add another section about it in the future, but I believe that if you've mastered this class, you should know how to use this feature as well.\nI'm sure you will enjoy this class and I can't wait to see the amazing movies you will make!",

This course is geared toward 8-12 teachers and technology coordinators, but is applicable with some modifications for the junior-high grades. Many of the methods shown here are also usable by parents and students.\nWe will also look at some of the basic ways your iPad can be used as a teaching tool, consumption, creation and curation device. The iPad 101 course is designed by a teacher for teachers - to make them more efficient users of the device.\nThere is plenty of backup and detail for the explanations in the training materials and videos. This is a basic course, but offers a tremendous amount of depth in understandings. iPad 101 asks four basic questions of how best to understand and use your iPad:\nHow is your iPad a consumption device?\nHow is your iPad a creative device?\nHow is your iPad a connective device?\nHow is your iPad a curation device?\nEach of these four critical understandings is woven through the course, presented with apps or built-in functionality, and looks to extend the device beyond it's original intentions.\nMost of the examples provided are aimed at using the device as a classroom tool, but are applicable in all industries.",

Learn tips and tricks in 10 minutes or less? Sounds familiar? I know because I have been there too.\nAre you frustrated with the fact that you can't find a comprehensive and interactive Mac course that will help you learn the basics and intermediate skills to be a bright star with your computer? A course that will allow you to ask questions, to request additional videos on everything regarding your Mac, it's not easy to find. There's a lot of noise. It is simply too much to take in.\nYou need one course that will set you aside from everyone else. No more wasting time researching for the perfect course, because there is no such thing as the perfect course unless it is looked after by its teacher.\nNo more hundreds of tabs on your browser to try to find an answer.\nThat's why I created: Mastering Your Mac: 10x your Productivity\nYou might be thinking: Yeah, right, another of those courses! I saw other courses out there, some are indeed awesome, but they still lack one common thing: Interactivity with the teacher. I saw hundreds of unanswered questions, and unresolved issues from students who could not get their questions answered.  Mac basics is not a topic many are looking for online, and that's why I felt this gap needed to be filled with a trustworthy ongoing course. You hear me right: Ongoing.  It will be ongoing because We are committed here, with your help and feedback to update this course periodically and make it remarkable for you to reference and to get inspired from, over and over for life.\nBenefits of the course:\nFully understand the essential functions to operate your computer\nBecome incredibly faster and more efficient in executing basic tasks\nFeel confident in using the Finder and customise it for your needs.\nBeing able to organise your files, Music, Work documents, Video clips and more using internal, external and virtual drives.\nFull understanding of iCloud and Apple ID\nCapable of using all the main apps that come standard with your Mac\nFeel confident connecting through wifi and setting up accessories\nFull understanding of the Photos app\n\n\nComfortable using Mail\nDescription:\nMastering your Mac is a complete course that will show you everything you need to know about your Mac. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned user, I designed the curriculum for self-tailored learning. It does not assume prior knowledge. However, you are free to skip, fast forward and pick the class that most suits your needs. The course will cover the foundations of all the main apps and will guide you through the most critical features without getting too technical.

This move often causes concern and confusion leaving people apprehensive about making the decision to move and worrying about potentially investing a lot of money in hardware that they are afraid they mightn't be able to use. This course will allay those fears and demonstrate clearly what the similarities and differences are and how anyone can make a smooth transition from one operating system to the other, regardless of their skill level.\nThe course is delivered using screen recordings of both Mac and Windows environments, comparing the two and showing step by step how to complete tasks using Mac OS X that you would be familiar with on Windows.\nThe course is divided into 6 sections and will take less than 3 hours to complete. Each section is divided into lectures, most of which average 4-6 minutes in duration.\nIf you are considering making the move to Mac OS X, or have already done so and you are struggling with some basic differences, this is the course for you! By the time you have completed the course, you will be comfortable with your Mac and be glad you made the decision to move!",

      "description": "どんなことが学べるの？\n一言で言えば、「ショートカット」はノーコードでmacでの作業を自動化するアプリです。\n\n\nこれまでiPhoneやiPadなどで使われていた複数の「作業をまとめて効率化」するアプリ「ショートカット」がmacOS Monterey、そして、最新版のmacOS Venturaを搭載したmacで使用できるようになりました。\n今回の入門編では、あらかじめ用意されたテンプレート（ギャラリー）を使ったショートカットの作成やショートカットエディタを使っての簡単なオリジナルのショートカットの作成について、その方法を学びます。\n\n\nどんな風に活用できるの？\n例えば・・・\nボタン一つで、忙しい朝の時間に仕事で使う複数のツールを自動で起動できたら・・・\nボタン一つで、休憩時間にボリュームを設定してお気に入りのプレイリストを自動で再生できたら・・・\nボタン一つで、仕事終わりに、たくさん開いたウィンドやアプリを一度に閉じることができたら・・・\nといったことが、できるようになります。\n\n\n何を用意するばいいの？\nmacOS Monterey／macOS  Venturaがインストールされたmacが1台、そしてインターネットへの接続があればいつでも始められます。\n\n\n操作は難しい？\nmacOSの基本的な操作として、キーボードからの簡単な入力やマウスでのドラッグや選択、コンテクストメニュー（※右クリックメニュー）などの簡単な操作ができれば大丈夫です。\n\n\nでも、覚えるのが大変？\n本コースは、標準的な再生速度で45分程度での受講時間です。１つ１つのレクチャー動画の時間も長くても数分間。忙しい時間の合間にも学習を進めていただきやすい構成となっています。もちろん、ご自身で操作や作成などを行なっていただく時間を考えても2時間程度のお時間を確保いただけば講座を最後まで受講いただけると思います。時間のかかるインストール作業や環境設定なども必要ないので安心してご受講いただけるのではないでしょうか。\n\n\nこの講座のオススメのポイントは？\n今回の入門編の講座のなかでお伝えできることには限りがあります。それでも講座の内容をマスターしていただくことで、何度も、毎日、毎回行う「作業をまとめて効率化」することができます。\n毎日の1分間を節約できたら、年間では365分。6時間以上の時間を新たに使うことができますね。\nこれがもし1日5分、10分なら・・・\n\n\nぜひ、「作業をまとめて効率化」する「ショートカット」にチャレンジしてみませんか？",

The fundamentals really never change, so come on in. ;)\nThis course is for those who are new to Apple computers. Whether you're transitioning from Windows, or you've just purchased a Mac for the first time, this course is built solely for you, the new Mac user. The only item required for this course is an Apple computer with at least Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) installed on it.\n(Click the Apple icon in the upper left-hand corner of your screen and tap \"About this Mac\" to see in the \"Overview\" tab, what version your operating system is.)\nIn short, this course will be like sitting down with a friend who gently guides and teaches you everything you need to know about your Mac. I loved taking care of people and their Macs while at Apple HQ, so you'll get nothing less here at Udemy.\nJoin the thousands of students who've already taken the plunge to learn about one of the best computers ever made!\n\nSide note: This course has over 4.5 hours of content and doesn't provide popcorn (you don't have to do it one sitting).

Il ne se limite pas à une simple liste de principes théoriques, mais adopte une approche interactive et pratique pour une meilleure assimilation. Dans cette optique, ce cours ne comporte pas que de la théorie abstraite ou des concepts éloignés de la réalité professionnelle. En effet, nous allons réaliser ensemble une présentation qui a pour objet de mettre en valeur une entreprise. L'objectif de cette méthode pédagogique est qu'au lieu de vous expliquer les fonctionnalités de manière théorique et parfois difficile à appliquer, nous verrons directement, au travers de cet exercice concret, comment pouvoir les utiliser à bon escient dans un contexte précis et réaliste.\nAinsi, grâce à cet apprentissage par la pratique, vous serez en mesure d'acquérir non seulement des compétences techniques, mais aussi une compréhension approfondie de leur utilité. À la fin de ce cours, vous serez donc parfaitement capable de réaliser une présentation convaincante, efficace et professionnelle, en ayant pleinement conscience des différentes possibilités qui s'offrent à vous grâce aux fonctionnalités apprises. Vous développerez une maîtrise qui ne se limite pas à des outils, mais qui intègre également des stratégies pour captiver et convaincre votre audience.",

Each one is a step forward to become a more efficient person. You can gradually learn at your own pace, and repeat the section or ask your doubts within the community before continue to the next section.\nBasic principles: don't know what GTD is? Never used OmniFocus before? This section is for you.\nCapture: techniques for capturing all the ideas and tasks that come to you and your mind daily.\nOrganise: slow down your horses!

Plus, every section has a final quiz, so you can be sure you have understood everything before taking the next step!\n\n\n## How long will the course take to complete?\nI carefully designed the course so you can at least take it in less than the 14 day free trial. But of course you can be faster. You can ideally take one section per day and finish the course in less than a week.\nThis is up to you, and will also depend on the mess level of your current life.\n\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\nJoin the GTD and OmniFocus, take the course and start improving your life right now!",

      "description": "**UPDATED AS OF NOVEMBER 2015 - JOIN 5,500+ SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS!**\nDo you ever feel like you spend too much time trying to accomplish simple tasks on the computer? Like there are days where you spend hours and only accomplish a tenth of what you hoped to accomplish when you got up that morning?\nIt's not a good feeling. But, for many of us, it's reality.\nWhy is this? Because many of us don't have mastery of the tool we use the most - our computers.\nWe've all heard the story of the woodcutter who sharpens his saw to cut more trees. Yet how many of us spend hours on the computer each day, yet never learn the tips and tricks to use them efficiently and effectively? Instead, we keep doing what we've always done, and waste time that we could spend relaxing, making more money, or hanging out with friends and family.\nThis course will change that. Over the past year, I've learned the tools and shortcuts to 10x my productivity on my Mac. Together, these productivity hacks have allowed me to write faster, blaze through email, use Microsoft Office at 5x the speed and get more done.\nA recent study estimated that slow computer usage cost the average employee 8 WHOLE DAYS of work per year, simply because they don't know how to efficiently use a computer. If Even if you've grown on up on computers, I guarantee this course will teach you how to use your Mac like a pro.\nAnd... the good news is you don't have to be a natural with computers to reap the benefits! I've helped my 50 year old mother (bless her) do her work faster so she can get off the computer she hates and spend time with her family.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll learn the deepest, darkest Macbook productivity secrets that only a few of the wizards at Apple know:\nShortcuts and tools to cut the time you spend in Microsoft Office by 60%\nA simple hack to reclaim minutes wasted navigating between programs each day\nHow to manipulate text like a BOSS and never use your mouse again\n7 strategies to master Gmail and process your email in seconds, not minutes\nAdvanced strategies and shortcuts with Finder, Quicksilver and Google Chrome\nIntroduction to 5 free tools that will save you hours over the course of your workday\nIf you want to reclaim your valuable time be more productive for the rest of your life, this course is for you.\nI packed tons of useful information into this course, so that just 60 minutes from now you can use your Mac better than 95% of Macbook owners. Pretty sweet, eh?\nIf that's not enough, Udemy offers a money back guarantee if for any reason you're not satisfied with any course you buy here. Plus, you'll get unlimited access to me and all further course material I'll be adding as more students join.\nIf you use a computer for more than an hour a day, you owe it to yourself to be as efficient as possible. In fact, your ability to get more done will lead to raises, promotions, time freedom and more productivity than you can believe.\nAnd, if for any reason you don't like the course, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.\nSee you inside!\nJustin Mares, Macbook wizard",

Our team has spent years studying note-taking apps, and we have put together everything we know about the app into this course. We are hoping that it will ease your digital transformation journey as you venture into digital note-taking.\nIn this course, we have focused on how to use Freenotes to get the most out of it.

      "description": "MASTERING YOU MAC HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER\n\nMAC CLARITY - KNOW YOUR MAC\n\nLearn how to play your Mac like the beautiful instrument that it is. Stop wasting time, feeling stressed and bugging your children or partner to help you when you get stuck. Know what you are doing every time you sit at your computer. Turn your projects into opportunities to really shine and express yourself without wasting hours on trying to work stuff out.\nThis is more than just another computer course.

Each lesson has lots of directions and tips. They show the keys being used written on the screen so you never have to guess anything. We will never assume you know what we are talking about. We make sure we show you clearly. Arron has been teaching this course for years in person so he knows what people want to know, what the common issues and questions are and how to explain everything in ways that it just makes sense.\n\n\nEASY AND ENGAGING LESSONS THAT YOU WILL ENJOY.\nArron is a natural teacher with a strong ability to engage and make learning about your computer fun and easy.

This will serve you powerfully for years to come. Learn at home at your own pace and fit the course around your lifestyle.\n\n\nCREATED FOR BEGINNERS, USED BY EXPERTS.\n\nThis course was designed with beginners in mind. The lessons are planned sequentially, meaning that you will watch your skill level quickly improve. Of course you can just jump around to specific lessons – which is useful later on to revise something. There is so much packed in here that even experts learn a lot about how they can improve their practice.\n\n\nFEATURES AND HIGHLIGHTS.\n100+ micro lessons (2-8mins)\n9 sequential levels covering specific topics.\nLife Coaching Tools to keep you on track and motivated.\nSet up a Mac the way you want it\nHave all your devices synchronised eg. IPhone, IPad and computer\nExplore the incredible potential of iTunes\nLearn simple ways to manage your filing and create order and ease\nLot’s of extra apps to improve your productivity and user experience\n30 day money back guarantee\n\n\nADDED BONUS\n\n1st Bonus\nAs a special added gift Arron has developed a powerful eBook devided into 12 powerful worksheets. Some of these are interactive and life coach you through your relationship, goals, motivation and intentions of how you use your computer. Would you like some more clarity of what might be getting in your way of being as productive and passionate as possible with your projects? As a successful life coach Arron has worked with this extensively. He understands how to move people through from being stuck to being successful. This is a holistic course. We don't want to offer you just the ability to use your Mac like a Pro. We also want you to feel good while doing it. To be passionately productive, to sit down at your computer and have confidence you won't get distracted by Facebook because you choose it, to feel powerful and capable every time you are using your Mac so you always reach your highest potential.\n\n\n2nd Bonus\nSeven video tutorials exploring these more holistic aspects of your relationship and use of your computer. Some fun, playful and informative information with a 'special' guest talking about desk yoga, healthy technology boundaries, feelings about technology, structure and flow and loads more.\n\n\nOUR VISION FOR YOU\nLearn how to play your Mac like the finely tuned instrument that it is. As a pianist, Arron understands the possibilities of muscle memory using shortcuts and practice to encourage flow and creativity. Dissolve the stumbling, clunky barrier of uncertainty and instead gracefully and easily achieve your intentions.\nExplore and move toward conscious use of your technology. Don’t fall down the Google Hole and get distracted and frustrated with yourself. Knowing your technology will help you stay on task.\nImagine sitting down to your computer with peace and clarity, and still feeling this as you finish your task. Aah, this is what we want for you and your life.\n\n\nAN AFFORDABLE PRICE WITH VALUE FOR MONEY\n\nThis course would usually cost you a lot more than our full price. We want this course to be affordable because our vision is bigger than just teaching people how to use their computer. We want to empower people to build a healthy and productive relationship with their technology. We see this as a crucial skill in this new age where we are often forced to use technology just to function. Imagine how much time and energy knowing how to really use your Computer will save you over your lifetime, most likely hundreds or thousands of hours. Not to mention the blood sweat and tears. What a powerful investment with a massive return potential!",

      "description": "According to a survey done by analyst firm Piper Sandler in 2022, 87% of teenagers in the United States have iPhones and that statistic is still on the rise. At the same time, there are news stories everywhere detailing the many teens and pre-teens that are negatively effected by cyber bullying and/or experience anxiety disorders related to social media use. Concerned parents are forced to walk a tight-rope of providing their teens with the devices and access they demand while also trying to protect their health and safety. With this in mind, Apple created Screen Time with parental controls and restrictions.\nApple Family & Home System Administration will teach you how to manage, monitor, and control your children’s iPhones, iPads, and Macs using Screen Time. You will learn how to properly configure these settings to ensure that you are preventing many of the most common workarounds that your children might exploit to get around these restrictions. You will also learn how to remotely manage, update, change, and approve requests from your child’s device via the Internet from your own iPhone or Mac.  In addition to the basic technical steps needed to enable such controls, special consideration is made to help parents set realistic goals for keeping their children safe on the Internet or limiting negative Social Media influences using Screen Time technologies.\nAs the course continues, we introduce the concept of Family Sharing and creating an Apple Family organization where you, your significant other, and children can share music, media, apps, and books that were purchased through one account across all other accounts and devices throughout your home. Family Sharing also applies to services like iCloud+, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music which could potentially save you money on subscription costs each month.\nLastly, once you have your Apple devices, content, and services managed through a Family Sharing organization we introduce the concept of home automation using HomeKit compatible accessories and Apple’s Home app. You will learn to configure common devices such as cameras, door locks, lights, and smart plugs to automate your home and provide additional security and convenience to everyone living under your roof. Real-word scenarios such as keyless entry using an iPhone (or Apple Watch), receiving security notifications when a child comes home from school, and using Siri to prepare a home for your arrival as you drive up the road are explored.\nOnce you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of using Family Sharing, and Screen Time to manage Apple devices in your household and configure HomeKit compatible accessories to better secure and automate your home.\n\n\nPhoto by Jeremy Bezanger on Unsplash",
