She is a fantastic teacher, very easy to listen to and the information is taught in a methodical and easy to understand way. I feel very ready to move on to bigger things now.\" - Cherilyn B.\nThe Mechanics of Watercolor Painting is a step-by-step course designed to guide students through all the necessary skills needed to paint with watercolor paints. Using her approachable, easy-to-understand teaching method and lots of hands-on activities, artist Jill Poyerd walks viewers through a total of nearly four hours of lectures and over 30 student activities, covering topics like brush handling, color mixing, paint application, and much much more.\nWe begin by learn all about your workspace. It’s important to have all of your tools readily available when you work. Then we discuss the many aspects of brushes, from how to physically handle a brush to how to properly dilute your paints.\nNext, the course focuses on how to mix your paints and how to get acquainted with your specific selection of colors.\nAnd finally, once we have a solid knowledge base, we learn about the three different application methods - controlled, semi-controlled, and uncontrolled paint application. We close the course with a watercolor painting demonstration so students can understand how it can all be put into practice.\nThis course is one of the most comprehensive classes you will find online related to learning how to use watercolors. It’s primarily aimed at the beginning painter, but it can apply to anyone who feels they may be lacking something in their knowledge when they paint in this medium.",

      "description": "Have you always wanted to learn to draw?\nHave you struggled to take your drawing skills to the next level?\nYou’re in exactly the right place. This course is for beginners and will take you to an advanced level. It's also for those who want to gain confidence with the fundamentals.\n\nI start you off nice and easy - Basic shapes and construction drawing\nMaster these and you’ll feel your confidence growing already. Lots of fun introductory projects like ‘Peppie the Pup’ build your skills step-by-step.\nThen move to intermediate then advanced. Wow! It looks so realistic! - Shading and Form\nThose skills you’ve admired in other artists for so long can be your skills too. Projects like ‘The Shoe Well Travelled’ will challenge you (but you are up to the task!) Your drawing will almost ‘pop’ off the page, amazing yourself and those around you.\nOne of the most admirable skills in art - Portraiture\nCapturing a likeness is one of the most admirable skills in art. It’s so satisfying. Render individual facial features and create a wonderful child portrait.\nThe Foundation to drawing most things - Perspective and Proportion\nHow can you represent the three-dimensional world on a flat piece of paper? How do things we see change as they get closer, further away or turn towards us? These questions are all answered with perspective. Your eyes are now open to a whole new way of seeing and drawing.\nPlus an extra bonus...\nMy fun, quick and easy approach to drawing people and cute characters using construction drawing.\n\nThis is the beginner to advanced drawing course you've been looking for...\nEven if you think you're not naturally talented my super easy methods and in-depth explanations will set you on the path from your first pencil lines into creating professional grade artworks.\nI've been teaching beginner artists for over 30 years. I know exactly what you need to get started the right way, and I've jam packed it into this course.\nPlus, if you have any questions at all throughout your drawing journey, just ask. I'm right here for you.\n\nWith more than 9000 students enrolled the written reviews tell you all you need to know\n\"I am really enjoying this course. The explanations are brilliant and there is so much material (among videos, documents and exercises) to explore! However what I love most is the possibility to be part of the course related FB group. That is amazing indeed!! Cindy does give a lot of feedbacks and all the members and the administrators are great!!\"  - Giorgio\n\"I'm learning things that seem so simple but have increased my artistic ability ten fold\" - Gideon Swanson\n\"I learned a lot right from the beginning... I always wanted to draw and this lady is bang on.\" - Elizabeth Brown\n\"The step by step instruction is so in-depth, easy to follow and produces real results. Cindy and Tannis as well as the online facebook support group that goes with the course provides an extra dimension of responsive and kindly criticism and loads of support.\" - Helen Hanby\n\"Cindy Wider is a beyond amazing teacher! She constantly interacts with her students and gives lots of encouraging comments, helpful tips to make sure everyone gets the help they need... You'll never feel alone and got lost in the path of being a better artist!\" - Zehra Eylem Kazgöz\n\"Great match for me - and the FB group discussion and feedback has been super wonderful, too!\" - Ann Petrochko\n\" I love that she’s so thorough with the basics and love her accent too.\" - Rebecca Douglass\n\"Clear and appropriate for beginners... I have noticed that she is very active and helpful in the facebook drawing community... Impressed with everything so far.\" - Shak Man\n\" Cindy is very engaged with her students and is always very kind, supportive and encouraging!\" - Patricia Gliniecki\n\"Great to have a course that starts off with the foundations and then builds upon them.\" - Andrew Bensch\n\"This course is perfect for complete beginners.\" - Lindsay Ferrara\n\nMy students say we have \"the best Facebook group on the internet!\"\nWhen you enroll in this course you can join my Facebook group \"Cindy Wider's Beginner Drawing Family\". It really is the most supportive and friendly community you'll find anywhere. My students call themselves 'DrawPj'ers\" (after my website). DrawPj stands for Draw in your Pj's - the little blocks of time. Don't wait until you retire to claim your talent for drawing.\nIt's family friendly place where you can ask questions and request feedback from the community. When you're feeling confident you can share what you've learned with others taking the same exciting journey.\nI'll be there too with my team too. I look forward to meeting you and seeing all the wonderful things you create.",

        "MAGNOLIA is the third in my series of 'Paint Realistic Botanical and Watercolour' tutorials. The first, 'STUDIO BASICS' is an invaluable foundation course to help you understand my own approaches to this work, the techniques I use, and gives you a clear understanding of the materials I use in order to move forward in sync with me as much as possible. Everything I teach with you stems from these basics so it is critical information.  The subsequent 'CHASING AUTUMN' course is a perfect transition into simple, fun hands-on painting. It is an ideal introduction to the medium, genre, and opportunity to get a feel for this work, and a perfect launch pad to grow from. There is a level of assumed knowledge in the follow on courses, so this core information will be extremely beneficial to you in order to gain the most out of the MAGNOLIAS tutorial possible.

      "description": "With the autumn leaves tutorial complete, its time to explore the glorious new season of Spring! My next stop is to investigate the remarkable beauty of MAGNOLIAS, such a heartwarming sight, marking an end to winter over the world.\n\n'Paint Realistic Watercolour and Botanicals - MAGNOLIAS' is a watercolour painting tutorial, placing the spotlight on the gorgeous Magnolia as a subject. Inspiring an undying love from most in botanical painting, the Magnolia is certainly one of my all time favourite subjects to illustrate as well. I can think of no better way to explore the Magnolia subject than with than the equally delicate, romantic and beautiful watercolour medium.... and now is your chance to join me to learn how for yourself!\nFollowing the STUDIO BASICS and the CHASING AUTUMN tutorials, the Magnolia remains a simple yet slightly more complete study of a single botanical subject, and is an ideal subject for us to take out next step together. A beautiful subject alone, it presents us with manageable areas of simple wash, glaze and dry brushing in a harmonious colour combination. It is a perfect opportunity to start stepping the complexity of our techniques up from the previous course into some new botanical painting territory.\nWorking in layers, we start the magnolias with some beautiful wash work, then develop this further with the use of basic glazing to develop some beautiful richness and texture to our magnolia painting. Finishing off our work, we will try a little dry brushing to enhance the delicate leathery textural effects of the magnolia petals to completion. It is a perfect transition for us to explore on many levels.\nTo illustrate the Magnolia in this tutorial, we will be addressing how to approach a variety of components relevant to this subject and its elements. From stems to petals, the intricate flower centre, furry leaf buds and some small leaf details to complete our painting, this step by step course will help you through every stage of the painting process. This is an ideal subject for exploring botanical illustration, the watercolour medium, and for students of any level to learn from.\n\nFor those starting out, or who feel a little nervous about where to begin, I have designed and created a series of painting exercises to help you connect with the medium and subject, to familiarise you with the process and to equip you with a clear path and strategy forwards into your finished painting.\nFor those wanting to get deeper into the nitty gritty of this subject, Ive developed a specific 'extension section' that delves deeper into painting the magnolia centre, one of the most challenging aspects of this subject. Many times a painting is lost in the quality of our details, so here we place the spotlight on this element to help expand your knowledge and painting skills even further. This mini NutShell extension tutorial is called 'Magnolia Centre ~ The Heart of the Matter', and is the first in a new line of mini spotlight tutorials called ~ The NutShell Series. It is botanical painting in a Nutshell.\nWith so much diversity, the magnolia is a dreamy playground for botanical artists, and a perfect subject to explore on so many levels. Painting the Magnolia flowers explores creating texture using washes, glazes and dry brushing whilst the flower centre focusses on more detailed work using fine line work, and of course dry brushing techniques. These techniques are so critical to the watercolour painting medium and couldn't be more essential to creating successful Botanical Art across the board.\nSo welcome to the next online 'Paint Realistic Watercolor and Botanicals' tutorial. I am looking forward to seeing you in the wash!",

Jill has provided general and detailed information in a way that is easily understood and clearly defined.\" - Rebecca S.\n\"I feel like I learned more watching and listening to this course than any other class that I've ever taken. Thank you!\" - Bonny E.\nBrushstrokes are at the core of being an artist, and an individual's brushwork is one of the things that sets them apart from other artists. Using her approachable, easy-to-understand teaching method and lots of hands-on activities, artist Jill Poyerd breaks down historic and contemporary brushwork into twenty-two unique brushstrokes, using both oil and watercolor paint in her demonstrations.\nThis course is part one of a two-part series and covers twelve of the twenty-two strokes. They are broken down by style of application and include a brief history, examples of how they're used in masterpieces, visual demonstrations, and student practice exercises. By combining technical learning with visual and hands-on examples, students will gain a thorough understanding of each brushstroke variation. Part one covers invisible strokes, direct painting, strokes that use light amounts of paint, and strokes that use thick, impasto paint.\nNote: Demonstrations are given in both watercolor and oil paint. Acrylic painters simply have to apply the knowledge depending on how they use that medium, whether thick (like oil) or thin (like watercolor).",

      "description": "Procreate is an amazing digital art app on iPad for sketching, drawing, finished illustrations, and painting. It's an incredibly flexible application that total beginners or seasoned professionals can use to make digital art!\nMy name is Kurt, and I use Procreate in my professional work at Image Comics as well as my own digital paintings. I've been creating tutorials and online courses since 2013 teaching thousands of students worldwide about digital art.\nProcreate is a bit like a piano. If you know the basics, you can play Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star or, with a little practice, you might play some Beethoven! There are so many hidden gestures, functions, and features that take a full advantage of iPad's multi-touch features in a way that is simply impossible on Android or Windows devices.\nThe course is designed to show you how to get the most of Procreate in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step way. I've covered the basic tools in my course The Beginner's Guide to Digital Art with Procreate, and this course takes it all a step further and really dives deep into Procreate's tools and gestures.\nThere are several sections that focus on different areas of the application. Here are a few examples:\nLayer functions\nAlpha lock - never worry about going outside the lines again!\nReference - select your flat colors without switching layers!\nMasking - a super-powerful digital art tool!\nDrawing and painting tricks\nQuickline - Draw straight lines without a ruler at perfect angles!\nAdd textures to your work and control where they go.\nPaint with the Smudge tool. Even paint with the eraser!\nLittle-known gestures galore!\nControl how the Filters & Adjustments affect your work with great accuracy.\nIn each lesson, I'll go over how a function works, then show you how you can use it in your own art. Many of Procreate's functions are MUCH more powerful than most users realize.\nI'll also include:\nthe Procreate file I work on throughout the course\nthe Procreate file from two of my own digital paintings with all the layers, so you see exactly how these techniques work from the inside out. This also includes the time-lapse playable within Procreate. You can fast-forward, rewind and zoom to see the process of creating it! Very helpful.\na copy of the texture we'll create during the course\nSo join me! I'd love to help you get get the most out of my favorite digital art app for iPad! See you inside! :)\n-KMR",

In this course you’ll learn to do drawings that give the illusion of 3-Dimensional objects occupying deep space.\nYou’ll start by learning how to draw the sphere, the cylinder and the cube, the foundational shapes that all other forms, no matter how complex, are constructed from.  Next you’ll learn to combine and manipulate these forms to draw any form observable or imaginable.  You'll even get an introduction to linear perspective! Never again will your drawings appear flat and lifeless on the page.\nThe Art & Science of Drawing is a remarkable program that will teach you how to draw one day at a time. The program is simple, each day you’ll watch one video lesson that introduces an essential drawing skill, and then do the recommended practice. The Art & Science of Drawing is overflowing with powerful insights into the drawing process and offers some of the clearest, most accessible drawing instruction available. Many of the tools and techniques you'll learn here are rarely seen outside of private art academies.\nThis is the perfect course for painters who want to add depth to their work and the perfect primer for figure drawing. Learning how to think and draw in terms of volume is what makes the difference between good artists and great artists.\nThis course contains the third and fourth installments of an 8-part series.  If you're a beginner, we recommend going through the entire series in the following order:\nBasic Skills\nDynamic Mark Making\nForm & Space\nMeasuring & Proportion\nContours\nShading Fundamentals\nShading: Beyond the Basics\nIf you've got some drawing experience, feel free to mix and match The Art & Science of Drawing courses to suit your personal needs as an artist!",

Brilliantly narrated, videos quality are amazing and super explanatory. 6 stars!\" - Joao C.\n“I am learning so much. It is really helping me to understand the medium I am working with, as well as how I can manipulate it to create the effects and emotions I want. Everything just changes when you know what you are looking for. My level of confidence in watercolour has definitely skyrocketed.” - Nicole O.\n\n\nThe instructor of this course is a Signature Member of the National Watercolor Society.\nWatercolor painting at its core is built upon pigment, water, and a painting surface, and in order to master the medium you need to thoroughly understand your materials. This course is designed to give you an in-depth look at the properties of each material used in the watercolor painting process. With this understanding, beginners will have an easier time learning techniques and experienced painters will be better equipped to perfect their skill and solve potential problems. This isn’t a hands-on painting class, but rather is a lecture-based course containing information you aren't likely to find anywhere else.",

Thank you for a fantastic course.\" - Kai Z\n\"Awesome job, one of the best art courses on Udemy. It definitely worth to watch. Thank you so much!\" - Rula B.\nBrushstrokes are at the core of being an artist, and an individual's brushwork is one of the things that sets them apart from other artists. Using her approachable, easy-to-understand teaching method and lots of hands-on activities, artist Jill Poyerd breaks down historic and contemporary brushwork into twenty-two unique brushstrokes from traditional to unconventional.\nThis course is part two of a two-part series and covers ten of the twenty-two strokes. They are broken down by style of application and include a brief history, examples of how they're used in masterpieces, visual demonstrations, and student practice exercises. By combining technical learning with visual and hands-on examples, students gain a thorough understanding of each brushstroke variation. Part two covers broken strokes as well as alternative application methods and finishes with a five-stroke painting exercise.\nNote: Demonstrations are given in both watercolor and oil paint. Acrylic painters simply have to apply the knowledge depending on how they use that medium, whether thick (like oil) or thin (like watercolor).",

It’s a skill you can learn and master with the right system.\nI’m Ali — a self-taught artist who went from sketching deformed cartoon faces… to winning the National Gold Medal and becoming the National Sketching Champion – all in just a few months of focused, consistent practice.\nIf I could transform my skills this quickly through trial and error, then you can absolutely do it too — especially with the structured, step-by-step system I’ll guide you through in this course.\nJust like you need to learn numbers before doing math, or know what a key looks like before driving, you need to learn the basics to draw well. This course is your key.\nYou’ll start with the simplest building blocks: lines and shapes. Everything in the world is made of shapes, and all shapes are made of lines. Once you understand this, you'll see drawing in a whole new way.\nFrom there, we go deeper. You’ll learn essential skills like:\nThe elements of art\nProportions and composition\nLight, shadow, and textures\nPortrait drawing – including eyes, noses, lips, and realistic hair etc.\nAnd once you’ve built that foundation, you’ll also unlock a bonus module featuring hyperrealistic, life-size drawing projects — the same kind of work I create for national exhibitions. It’s your chance to apply everything you’ve learned to create professional-level pieces that stand out in portfolios, galleries, or client work.\nI’ve also included practice exercises after many lessons to help you build confidence and control in your hand movements. These exercises are the real key to improving fast.\nJoin today and get lifetime access to all the course material — including any future updates, bonus tutorials, and reference packs — completely free of cost.\nThere’s also a dedicated Q&A section, where you can post your sketches, ask for feedback, or get answers to your questions. I check in almost daily and personally reply to all questions.\nThank you for checking out this course. I truly believe you're going to enjoy learning with me — and I can’t wait to help you unlock your full drawing potential.",

      "description": "A CONSISTENT WINNER.\nNEW Bonus lecture, check out the contents\nUPDATED 2025\nALSO, essential assignment, is really helping people understand how the paints work. I'm getting great feedback.\n\n\nREVIEW:\n'I loved the fact that your lessons were truly created with basics in mind! I have been painting on my own, or with some occasional lessons for a few years. I now feel more confident with the fundamentals which I had not been sure of before. thank you' Lorraine Sargent\n\n\nIf you've always wanted to paint with watercolor paints but just do not know where to start. This course is for YOU. Created by a selling artist.\nThis may be mostly suitable for adults.\nWhy? Because as adults you collect limiting beliefs about what you can and can't do. Painting might be one of them.\nThis is a 'learn through play' course and is very basic  You will simply learn how to get the paint from the box via the brush and onto the paper.\nYou will paint an apple three times but in different ways so that you can escape the draw and 'colour in' method you learnt as a child.\nIf you want to make a start to paint without feeling intimidated by the paints, the process or the expectations. By simply playing with your paints, coloring simple shapes your understanding will grow as will your confidence.\nDO NOT take this course if you need a formal structure and are not prepared to learn through play. I will not talk about the names of colours, colour mixing, composition or drawing. It is just to get you started.\nIf you have already been painting with watercolors, this course is not for you.\n\nWhy choose one of my courses?\nBecause, as a self taught artist I understand how a lot of people feel about their creative work, sometimes anxious, sometimes overwhelmed and often that it's not 'good enough'. I will hold your hand as you overcome these fears as I offer a friendly, relaxed and sensitive teaching style.\nI also have years of experience of teaching people of all levels both in person and via the internet.\nDo one of my courses and you will feel as if I am in the room with you every step of the way.\n30,000 subscribers on YouTube.\nEnjoy your painting, love Nicola\n\n\nThis is what one student posted in her blog : - 'I was so surprised to find that she (Nicola) started very simply, just playing with water and unmixed colors of paint. Slowly a beautiful patchwork of designs appeared on her page. Where boundaries and boundaries in the art have been blurred, she went to a pen and neatened up. Something else to add to the designs and to add some swirls and triangles to the dried paint. With growing excitement I realized that this project was well within my comfort zone. '",

      "description": "Have you ever tried “painting flowers before but ended up with\nMud\nBillions of brush strokes\nStiff-looking stems or\nPetals that look overworked and tired\nWould you believe that painting different kinds of flowers, botanicals or foliage can be done using a combination of only 2 essential techniques?\nThey sure do!\nWatercolors can flow and drip, blend and bleed, all of which can make painting flowers, effortless. What that means is, you apply the paint and let the water do the rest. You just need to let the water and color, paint the painting with you, and I'm here to show you how!\n\n\nWHO AM I?\nHey there! Broderick here and I paint in watercolor professionally, from simple character designs to realism, to fun art, even fine art pieces hanging in Museums in Europe.\nI’ve been a featured artist for a major art supply chain (Youtube: “urban sketching broderick wong”)\nSocial media loves my quirky watercolor pet portraits (Google: “Vancouver is awesome broderick wong”)\nPlaced first in live painting competitions (2016 Harmony Festival Plein Air Champion; 2018 Grand Prix Plein Air Masters Division Champion)\nThe Fabriano InAcquarello 2020, an international watercolor painting conference hosted in Italy, invited me to do an online painting demonstration as an international artist. (Google: \"inarte fabriano 2020 brod wong”)\nI've led live watercolor painting workshops for people who have never picked up a brush before\nI'm also the creator of 3 highly popular watercolor courses here on Udemy, including the Bestseller Watercolor Painting for Beginners\n\n\nWHY LEARN FROM ME?\nThere are watercolor painting classes out there that use up hours on soul-crushing lectures and theory before putting brush to paper and when you finally do, it's all about repetitive drills, forgettable color chart and swatch exercises, demoralizing activities that are too mediocre or too complex, random techniques without understanding why, leaving you with so much playing, experimenting, and accidents, but still not knowing how to properly apply the knowledge in a practical way.\nI'm here to show you that learning doesn't have to be mind-numbing.\nSeriously. You just need the right guidance.\n\n\n1) SHORT LASER-FOCUSED LESSONS\nIn this course, you will start with simple activities to equip you with 2 essential flower-power techniques, taking time to apply them properly on simpler subjects first.\n\n\n2) SEQUENTIAL LEARNING\nThen, you will learn how to combine these techniques with the fundamentals:\nCreating the illusion of volume and depth without painting every single petal\nDescribe dimension through subtle folds and wrinkles\nLearn how to blend colors to create soft marks and exploding patterns\nCreate flowing lines of stems and veins using brush techniques\nNew lessons introduce new techniques & reinforce what you learned in previous lessons. Lessons include carefully designed activities to match the skill level. Lessons are concise but packed with only relevant information\n\n\n3) PROCESS-ORIENTED VS. RESULTS-ORIENTED\nMy style of teaching is process-based, meaning, you will walk away with proper technique and application so you can paint your own flowers after. You will not be limited to painting just the flowers in the activities. This is why I refer to it as Flower Power Techniques, techniques you can use to paint your own projects!\n\n\n4) NOT YOUR TYPICAL, TRADITIONAL COURSE\nMy live watercolor painting workshops have given me the opportunity to target and isolate very specific challenges about the painting process, from a learner’s point of view, and then break them down into short laser-focused lessons.I found that these challenges are multi-layered and overlapping, making it difficult to know where to begin.\nThis is why you may feel you’re taking 2 steps forward and 4 steps back.\nMy Watercolor Painting Flowers (and all my other courses) peel away those layers, then simplifies them into short focused lessons, allowing you to learn only what you need to know at that time, to get you to the next level. Succeeding lessons will have their own short, focused sessions that gradually build on top of the previous.\n\n\nThis course includes everything that I teach in my $260 live workshops and more!\n\n\nIt's jam-packed with extra tips, full commentary, clear instructions, and step-by-step guidance. You will get access to additional learning\nthrough other student works, responses to questions, and, did I mention, you don't need to know how to draw?\nI've also prepared a special lesson that integrates everything, complete with background, subtle texture, light, and shadow making your painting pop!\n\n\nWHO IS THIS FOR?\nIf you already know the fundamentals of Wet on Dry and Wet on Wet painting, but don't want to spend 1-hour painting ...1 petal, or if you want to paint different types of flowers where you paint as you learn right away, instead of sitting through, lengthy, boring lectures presenting more challenges before you paint, then Watercolor Painting Flowers is for you!\n\n\nAre you an Absolute Beginner?\nIf you are looking for a new hobby, or maybe you’ve gathered a collection of watercolor supplies but haven't found the time or courage to paint or maybe you’re looking for a break from other more career goal-oriented courses, I would recommend taking my Watercolor Painting for Beginners first.\n\n\nAre you an \"On and Off\" Painter?\nAs long as you are comfortable with Wet on Dry and Wet on Wet applications, then this is for you. But, if You've tried watercolor and find it difficult to control, you may need a refresher on watercolor or maybe you need direction because you seem to choose the wrong and complicated things to paint.\nDo you appreciate hearing what artists think as they paint?\nDo you find painting the same thing over and over boring and tiresome?\nDo you appreciate some background information about watercolor and a progressive build-up of technique and application?\nIf you feel you need more guidance with Wet on Dry painting, my Watercolor Painting For Beginners is a good place to start. If you've got a good handle on Wet on Dry but always wanted to learn the secrets to Wet on Wet painting, then Watercolor Painting For Beginner Techniques and Effects is what you need to learn first.\n\n\nHOW ELSE CAN I HELP YOU?\nI’m here to help you think like water.\nThe more you understand, the less uncertainty there is, the more excited you will be to paint. You will first learn how to control your watercolor. Then I’ll show you how to use water and let it do what it wants. This is what I call, Controlled Spontaneity: A give and take between you and the watercolor. You will learn how to use water, to do different techniques, such as smooth washes, blending, glazing, color mixing, and so much more.\n\n\nMy Watercolor Painting Flowers course is professionally produced:\n● All videos are shot in high definition\n● Over the headshots showing my entire setup\n● Close-up shots for color mixing\n● Clear and consistent audio/commentary\n● Combination of energetic and relaxed pacing\n● Casual conversations instead of formal lectures\n● Receive the information in small segments. No over-explaining.\n● Animation/Visual Cues to let you know where I want you to focus on\n● Fun activities with new challenges in each lesson to build up technique and application\n\n\n7 hours I 3 practice sessions I 4 flower activities I 1 special bonus lesson\n\n\nENROLL NOW!\n\n\nI can’t wait to help you create your own fantastic flowers, once and floral, using color with water!",

The program is simple, each day you’ll watch one video lesson that will introduce an essential drawing skill, and then do the recommended practice. THE ART & SCIENCE of DRAWING is overflowing with powerful insights into the drawing process and offers some of the clearest, most accessible drawing instruction available.  Many of the tools and techniques you'll learn here are rarely seen outside of private art academies.\nThis course is highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn to paint as well. Most master painters agree that drawing is a fundamental and essential skill for all painters.\nIf you're a beginner, we recommend going through the entire series in the following order:\nBasic Skills\nDynamic Mark Making\nForm & Space\nMeasuring & Proportion\nContours\nShading Fundamentals\nShading: Beyond the Basics\nIf you've got some drawing experience, feel free to mix and match The Art & Science of Drawing courses to suit your personal needs as an artist!",

      "description": "In this 5.5-hour portrait drawing course I will teach you step by step how to draw your first impressing portrait with a pencil on a paper or with a digital drawing tool.\nNo previous drawing knowledge is necessary. This drawing course is for beginners.\nMost people think that drawing a human portrait is extremely difficult. Actually, it's just a myth. If there is desire in you, you will learn this stuff. Believe it or not, art is not the privilege of the few, it is more like a set of skills that you can learn.\nEven if you draw like a 4-year old kid now, it will change dramatically in a few days.\nPortraiture is a great thing, because once you draw you first pencil portrait, it will make you believe that you are able to learn to draw anything.\n\n\nWhat drawing tools you need\nIf you have just a traditional graphite pencil and some copy papers, that's perfectly enough to begin this course. But if you prefer to use any digital drawing tools, that's ok too. For example, you can use Photoshop with a drawing tablet, or the popular drawing & painting app called Procreate on the iPad with the Apple Pencil. Whatever drawing tool you use, note that we will be doing traditional portrait drawing with a simple graphite pencil (or its digital equivalent).\n\n\nContent\nThis beginner drawing course consists of four main sections.\nI like to build up my students' drawing skills systematically, so we will start off with the basic building blocks of the human head, and gradually moving forward. You'll be doing plenty of drawing exercises before you draw your first full portrait.\n\n\nThe 1st section is about the structure of the head. The structure, the proportions, and relative position of the facial features (the eyes, the nose, the ears, the mouth, etc.) are crucial for drawing a realistic portrait.\nSo, you will learn\nhow to draw the head from any angle in a few simple steps (sketching)\nthe proportions of the head, the location of facial features in front view and side view\nthe planes of the head which will help you to understand its 3D structure, how to draw a face in perspective, and create a believable shading later in the course\n\n\nThe 2nd section is about one of the most important drawing skills called shading. Shading is key to create depth and the illusion of 3-dimensionality on your drawings.\nYou will learn\nhow an object surface behaves in light\nhow shadows are created\nand how to illustrate them on your drawings to create a convincing 3D look\nYou can also make some shading exercises to prepare yourself for drawing faces from real life.\n\n\nIn the 3rd section you will have the opportunity to draw each facial features one by one in all kinds of viewing angles.\nYou will learn\nhow to draw eyes\nhow to draw nose\nhow to draw ears\nhow to draw mouth or lips\nAs a bonus, I'll show you how to illustrate emotions on the face in cartoon style. When you draw a human portrait, it's important to observe every little details on your subject's face. Drawing cartoon faces is fun, and a great exercise to recognize the important facial features. Don't miss this lesson!\n\n\nIn 4th section we will make a fairly realistic, full pencil portrait from scratch.\nWe will\ntake a reference photo, and analyze the face piece by piece\ndraw the construction lines of the head paying special attention to proportions and relations\nthen start the shading process step by step building up the face layer by layer\nmake the final touches and polish the portrait\n\n\nIf you follow my instructions and perform the drawing exercises along the way, your friends and family will be amazed what a human portrait you're capable to draw.\nHave some fun with me and enroll in this portrait drawing course now.\n30-Day Money Back Guarantee!\nPlease watch the 2-min Free Preview Video to see if this course is good for you.\nYou will get an overview of what you can expect from this online course.",

It was excellent and covered every aspect of the subject matter. The teacher was engaging and provided both photographic references and videos and gave material to download for future reference.

Each lesson contains at least one practice reel with timed poses specifically chosen so you can get the most out of the lesson they accompany.\nBy the end of this course you’ll be able to do gesture drawings that stand alone as works of art as well as lay the foundation for more detailed figure drawings.\nBecause this course features photographs of a fully nude model, it is important that you conduct yourself maturely and appropriately in the course.\nAlthough this is a beginning figure drawing course, it is not a beginning drawing course.  Some basic drawing skills are recommended.",

If you know the basics, you can play Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star or, with a little practice, you might play some Beethoven!\nThe course is designed to show you an easy-to-follow, step-by-step method of digital painting from grayscale to color. It's a great way for beginner's to learn how to focus on the important parts (value and contrast) without having to worry as much about color at first. This method will make it easier for you to select colors that work well together. You'll also learn how to avoid the common mistakes and pitfalls beginners make - like flat looking colors.\nWe'll go through the entire process together - from sketch to finished product! In each section, we'll focus on a specific aspect of the process.\nWe'll start with a basic thumbnail sketch, but feel free to create your own.\nWe'll tighten it up and start adding the light and shading.\nWe'll learn how to apply colors in a simple, but effective way that works for almost any type of digital painting.\nLastly, we'll polish up the fine details.\nMy name is Kurt, and I use Procreate in my professional work Image Comics as well as my own digital paintings. I've been creating tutorials and online courses since 2013 teaching thousands of students worldwide about digital art.\nProcreate is MUCH more powerful than most users realize. You'll learn tons of tips, tricks, and shortcuts that I had to learn the hard way! :)\nI'll also include:\nthe Procreate file I work on throughout the course, so you can see how the layers work from the inside!\nseveral stages of our exercise, so you can pick it up at almost any point in the process.\nSo join me!

How do I actually use these concepts in my art?!\nIf you’ve ever found yourself asking that question, this is the course for you!\nIn addition to the hours of real-time, step-by-step video lessons, you’ll also get:\nLine drawings for practice, so you can focus on color.\nLayered PSD files used in the lessons.\nExamples from my pro work as a digital colorist at Image Comics & Top Cow.\nAlthough Photoshop is used throughout this course, the color theory concepts taught here can be applied with most of your favorite digital art applications such as Photoshop, Clip Studio, Paintstorm, Procreate, Corel Painter, Sketchbook Pro, Krita, ArtRage, etc.\nSo if you're ready to learn how to make color work FOR you, instead of against you, I'll see you inside. :)",

      "description": "This is the 1st episode of my How to Draw 101 series. This course is about Basic Drawing Skills and 3D Sketching.\nIf you are an absolute beginner at drawing, this session can be a perfect choice for your very first drawing course. Or if you are not a beginner, but you are having difficulties with your drawings, you are just probably missing some of the basic puzzles which can be easily fixed in these lessons.\nThis course requires no previous drawing knowledge or special drawing equipment.\nWe'll be drawing with simple traditional graphite pencil on ordinary paper.\nThe first section is kind of an introduction to drawing.\nI will show you\nthe drawing tools you need\noptional tools for the future\nhow to hold the pencil to get a better drawing experience\nhow to see the world with the eyes of the artist\nIn the second section we will go through the basic building blocks of drawing. We will develop your basic drawing skills making a lot of fundamental drawing exercises.\nYou will learn how to draw\nstraight lines\nparallel lines\nsimple 2D shapes like triangles, rectangles, and squares\ncurves\ncircles, ovoid shapes, and ellipses\nsimple 3D objects like cubes and cylinders\nWe will also develop your hand coordination by connecting dots with straight and curved lines.\nThe goal of these lessons is to gain confidence at drawing these simple elements that we will use to build more complex objects.\nI will give you an introduction to perspective drawing discussing the most frequently used 2-point and 3-point perspective. I will also explain an important drawing principle called foreshortening. With this knowledge you'll be able to draw subjects convincingly in the 3D space.\nIn the third section we'll put the drawing skills you've learned into practice. We will make all sorts of sketches on real life subjects based on reference photos. We will draw\na chess pawn built from simple 2D shapes\na chair by drawing straight lines using the rules of perspective\na fish using a bunch of S-curves\na profile portrait to practice proportions\na chess pawn with simple shading\na pair of glasses\na dancing human figure for an introduction to gesture drawing\nand an astronaut just for fun\nAt the end of the course, you can check if your drawing skills have improved. You can compare your sketches made at the beginning and at the end of the course. If you make all the exercises with me, I'm sure you will make a difference.\nI hope you will enjoy this course as much as I did during its creation.\nSee you in my Basic Drawing Skills & Sketching Exercises course!",

      "description": "I'd say that he is a patient teacher and a very effective communicator. He is also organized and gets to the point so you have more time to learn. He is also funny which makes the class more fun. Time just flew by because he showed passion in his art and it was obvious when he taught. - Suzie Ang\n\n\nHave you always wanted to paint a landscape scene?\n\n\nLandscape painting can be seen as\ntaking small, individual activities\nand putting them together into one complete painting.\n\n\nNow how do we put it all together?\n\n\nThe big secret to painting landscapes\nis not how much you need to know,\nbut what you need to know, first\nand I'm here to teach you.\n\n\nWHO AM I?\nHey there! Broderick here and I paint in watercolor professionally,\nfrom simple character designs, to realism, to fun art, even fine art pieces hanging in Museums in Europe.\n\n\n\nI’ve been a featured artist for a major art supply chain (Youtube: “urban sketching broderick wong”)\n\n\nSocial media loves my quirky watercolor pet portraits (Google: “vancouver is awesome broderick wong”)\n\n\nPlaced first in live watercolor painting competitions (2016 Harmony Festival Plein Air Champion ; 2018 Grand Prix Plein Air Masters Division Champion)\n\n\nThe Fabriano InAcquarello 2020, an international watercolor painting conference hosted in Italy,\ninvited me to do an online painting demonstration as an international artist. (Google: \"inarte fabriano 2020 brod wong”)\n\n\nI’m also the creator of two popular and highly rated watercolor courses here on Udemy, including my best-selling Watercolor Painting for Beginners.\n\n\nIn this course, I'll show you how to put together a complete scene using the basic techniques, properly.\n\n\nWHY LEARN FROM ME?\nWhen I felt I knew enough, I wanted to paint EVERYTHING, from landscapes to animals, to portraits and urban scenes, but I quickly realized that with every 1 step I took forward, I took 4 steps back. It was such a strange, unusual experience that made me rethink how I had been painting. I ruined many watercolor paintings trying to paint in a different style. I experienced many happy accidents but didn’t know how to recreate them successfully. I persevered and took a handful of workshops and, over a brief period, I realized that there are levels to watercolors!\nFast forward to today, if I could have kick-started a path to success for myself to follow, to learn watercolor painting quicker without making so many mistakes, what would that look like? Through my experience in teaching myself and others, I have found the one thing that unlocks the full potential of watercolors and it is with this awareness that I present to you:\n\n\n\nWatercolor Painting Landscapes For Beginners\n\n\nBroderick's personality to teach made the learning enjoyable. It was not about how good he was an artist but how we can achieve what he was showing us to accomplish a finished painting. The technique was simple, easy to follow and not hard to comprehend. Broderick is inspirational and \"YES\" Watercolour Essentials is the WAY TO GO!!! - April Lee\n\n\n\n~o~\n\n\n\nWHO IS THIS FOR?\nIf you're comfortable with the basic rules of watercolor, or if you've taken both my foundational courses, Watercolor Painting for Beginners and Watercolor Painting for Beginners Techniques and Effects,\nthen this is for you.\n\n\n\nREADY TO PAINT DIFFERENTLY AND DIVE INTO SOMETHING NEW?\n\n\n\n~o~\n\n\n\nTHE PROBLEMS WITH LEARNING\n\n\n\nNow there can be a long list of rules theories and concepts to know and study and there are courses out there that either give too much technical information without relevant exercises, or they don't tell or show you enough and you still have to figure it out on your own.\n\n\nI will share with you my secret, I will teach you how to \"see\", like an artist first.\n\n\nI have found the most critical piece of learning for you to start with. This is the foundation that I believe you need to know first, before knowing everything else. Think of a cube, with velcro attached to all sides. Any piece of information you continue to learn after, will “stick” with you longer, because you will have a strong point of reference that you can\n\n\nYou will learn the 4 zones to help you know what to paint first, what to paint next, and what to paint last\nin a landscape scene.\n\n\n\nThen, I'll show you how to apply the basics , differently to create the illusion of depth and distance, glassy watery reflections, or a multi-colored sky,\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will learn how to mix different color combinations, with only a few colors.\n\n\nYou will be painting 4 different scenes, each representing the 4 seasons: painting a winter, spring, summer, and an autumn\nYou will learn how I paint thin, fine lines to create tree branches\nThis course includes everything that I teach in my live Wet On Wet workshops, ($260 total value) If you’ve taken different watercolor painting courses before but still have a hard time putting all your learning together into one complete painting, my Watercolor Painting Landscapes For Beginners course can help.\n\n\n\n1) SHORT LASER-FOCUSED LESSONS\n\n\n\nMy live watercolor painting workshops have given me the opportunity to target and isolate very specific challenges about the painting process,\nfrom a learner’s point of view, and then break them down into short laser-focused lessons.\nI found that these challenges are multi-layered and overlapping,\nmaking it difficult to know where to begin.\n\n\n\nThis is why you may feel you’re taking 1 step forward and 4 steps back.\n\n\n\nMy Watercolor Painting Landscapes For Beginners course peels away those layers,\nthen simplifies them into short focused lessons,\nallowing you to learn only what you need to know at that time, to get you to the next level.\nSucceeding lessons will have their own short, focused sessions that gradually build on top of the previous.\n\n\n\n2) LEARN WITHOUT THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD\n● I’ve distilled traditional art theory & practice into their fundamental essence\n● I use easy to understand language (aka no artsy fartsy terminologies)\n● I thoughtfully produce my material and content: Straight to the point. No extra fluff.\n\n\n\n3) SEQUENTIAL LEARNING\nThe way information is presented, oddly enough, has an enormous impact on what you learn,\nhow fast you learn and how you apply it. (Sometimes whether you learn at all!)\nI designed this course to build new information on top of what you already know. Think Lego.\n\n\n\n● New lessons introduce new techniques & reinforce what you learned in previous lessons\n● Lessons include carefully designed activities to match the skill level\n● Lessons are concise but packed with only relevant information\n\n\n\n“Thank you so much Broderick! This was a nice experience for me. I never knew I would fall in love with watercolour. I like the way you teach, it is easy to pick up and everything makes sense to me. Hoping to continue my journey with watercolour.” Joanne Whang\n\n\n\n4) NO SECOND GUESSING!\n\n\n\nKnowing differs from understanding.\nRandom tips and tricks are good for 1-time activities,\nbut have you tried painting something else after\nand felt like it sent you straight back to kindergarten?\nI've been there before. (A few times actually. Sigh.)\nYou need a stronger foundation to fall back on.\nUnderstanding what you’re doing with your watercolor will take you much further.\n\n\n\n● Too much control = Overworked, muddy paintings\n● Too much spontaneity = One big-happy-accident-type-of-paintings\n● Controlled spontaneity = Fresh, glowing, transparent paintings\n\n\n\n5) LET GO OF THE FEAR OF STARTING\n\n\n\n“I need to tidy up my work space”\n“Those plants look like they need a little drink today”\n“The cat needs…another bath!”\n\n\n\n“I thought that I was more experienced than beginners but I found out that I had a lot to learn. It was very different from other classes I have taken. Yours focuses on each specific technique. I have to tell you that I learned these techniques better in your class. I also learned things that no one had told me before. In other classes I have taken they showed us some of these techniques but didn’t spend as much time on them. They spent more time painting. I really enjoyed learning these things and I felt a sense of accomplishment after mastering them. I think they will stay with me better.” ~ Chris Mclaren\n\n\n\n6) HAVE FUN WHILE YOU LEARN!\n\n\n\nThere’s painting for fun, and then there’s painting to learn while having fun.\nThe course videos are professionally produced to educate and entertain.\nThis balance ensures a variety of presentations, instruction, humor and pacing!\n\n\n\n● Painting for fun = Just playing with paints, there is not much technique to take away.\n● Painting to learn = Heavy on theory and drills.\n● Painting to learn while having fun equips you with what you need to know, right away, so you can enjoy the watercolor painting process more.\n\n\n\n~o~\n\n\n\nHOW ELSE CAN I HELP YOU?\n\n\n\nI’m here to help you think like water.\nThe more you understand, the less uncertainty there is, the more excited you will be to paint.\nYou will first learn how to control your watercolor.\nThen I’ll show you how to just let it do what it wants.\nThis is what I call, Controlled Spontaneity: A give and take between you and the watercolor.\nYou will learn how to use water, to do different wet on wet techniques, ones that are a far departure from beginner techniques.\n“I liked the fun energy of each class with some laughter! The examples and what we could produce with each project gave excitement to the possibilities of each project! I loved learning all the different techniques and was super excited to learn another! The results of each project were simple enough to truly reach great results!” ~ Cynthia Cleator\n\n\n\nQ1: I don’t have strong drawing skills, should I take a drawing class first?\nYou don’t need to know how to draw.\nSince the focus of the lessons are about painting and not drawing,\nI will teach you a quick and easy way to sketch (that even kids can do!)\nso you can start painting right away.\n\n\n\nQ2: I had done so little watercolour painting before and I quit from frustration. “What makes your course different from others?”\n\n\n\nMy course is professionally produced:\n● All videos are shot in high definition\n● Over the head shots showing my entire set up\n● Close-up shots for color mixing\n● Clear and consistent audio/commentary\n● Combination of energetic and relaxed pacing\n● Casual conversations vs. formal lectures\n● Receive the information in small segments. No over explaining.\n● Animation/Visual Cues to let you know where I want you to focus on\n● Fun activities with new challenges in each lesson to build up technique and application\n\n\n\nThis is not your typical, traditional course.\nMy live watercolor painting workshops have allowed me to refine the lessons into what they are today,breaking down the watercolor process even more into its most essential concepts.\n\n\n\n“I would describe it as a controlled, guided, step-by-step approach to the basics of doing watercolour, taught by an excellent artist, with a wonderful manner and people skills. Excellent refresher for those with some experience.” ~ Bruce Raber\n\n\n\nQ3: Things are quite busy with work/kids/life. What if I don’t finish the lesson?\nThese lessons are available anytime you need them, wherever you are in the world.\nLearn at your own pace as long as you have a computer and an internet connection.\n\n\n\n~o~\n\n\n\nSo do you want to know how to paint differently, with the materials that you already have and paint breathtaking landscapes by the end of the course?\n\n\nThen enroll now! Build your skills and finally paint complete scenes using color, with water.\n\n\nI'll see you inside.\n\n\n\n“I went home yesterday excited about the watercolour painting we worked on in class and looked up different patterns I could draw out and paint for a mother's day gift. A circle with flowers and ivy and thinking of putting the word Love in the middle for a nice gift for my mom. So I guess you can say you've inspired me to want to paint more! Thank you for that.” - Emma Atherton\nYour demonstration is so detailed and easy to understand. The subjects you were creating for us to paint are also interesting and impressive as well. Now, I find a new way to paint watercolour and don't panic anymore. - Alice Peng",

By the end of this course you will have a firm understanding of the rules when drawing the human head as well as how to bend them for your creative needs!\nThis course is great for students that want to learn the basic construction techniques for drawing the human head or for more advanced artists that want to use a less structured approach. These lectures cover male and female character types with a variety of hair, expressions, face shapes, and view points.\nI have also included a new section on Facial Expressions.  Here you will learn how to draw various expressions to your characters that allow you to tell a better story with your illustrations.\nUpdated on 9-13-2022 - I added new lessons covering how to draw the head turned or looking away from our view.\nUpdated on 4-11-2023 - I included a PDF booklet with some practice activities that will help you apply some of the major techniques to drawing heads from different angles.  I will also add more to this book over time. ( attached to Section 3 )\nUpdated on 3-22-2024 I added a section on drawing the planes of the head.  You will learn the Andrew Loomis method as well as some other techniques to consider.  We will draw these at various angles to help you better understand the structure of the head.\nI hope you find this course to be extremely valuable and I am here to answer any questions as well as update lectures to make this a better learning experience for everyone.

      "description": "**Updated: April 3, 2017**\nHave you spent a lifetime admiring the grace and elegance of Arabic Calligraphy but never had the chance to learn the art? Have you spent ages looking for a viable resource to teach you the art in the English language but never found one? Has learning the art always been on your bucket list but you never got around to sloting it in your busy life schedule? If you answered yes to any one of the questions above, then this course is for you! This one of a kind Arabic Calligraphy course allows you the flexibility to learn anytime, from anywhere, and at your own pace. This is your chance to begin the journey of a lifetime; start learning today and explore your true artistic capabilities!\nNot sure if learning the art online is a good idea? In addition to Udemy's 30 day guarantee, you have my personal promise that this course, along with the perseverance to learn and practice, will have you scripting like a pro in a few months time.\nThis is an 8-week comprehensive and step-by-step course to learn the Naskh, Thuluth, and Diwani scripts from absolute scratch. Following is the outline for the course:\nWeek1: Introduction – Learning Methodology, Supplies, Dynamics of the pen, Scaling and Measurements\nWeek 2: Naskh Day 1 – Introduction, Letters Aleph to 'Ain\nWeek 3: Naskh Day 2 – Letters Fa to Hamza, Sample sentence scripting\nWeek 4: Thuluth Day 1 – Introduction, Letters Aleph to 'Ain\nWeek 5: Thuluth Day 2 – Letters Fa to Hamza, Sample sentence scripting\nWeek 6: Diwani Day 1 – Introduction, Letters Aleph to 'Ain\nWeek 7: Diwani Day 2 – Letters Fa to Hamza, Sample sentence scripting\nWeek 8: Planning and drafting masterpieces, Conclusion\nFAQ\nIs this course suitable for my kids to take? Of course, the earlier a child starts learning calligraphy, the easier it is to pick up the art.\nWhen does this course start and end? Is there a fixed schedule? There is no start and end date to the course, and there is no fixed schedule; this course keeps your busy life schedule in mind and allows you the flexibility to attend the lessons whenever you'd like.\nAre these live sessions or pre-recorded lessons? These are pre-recorded detailed tutorial videos which you can watch as many times as you'd like.\nSince this is an 8 week course, will we have access to videos for only 8 weeks? 8 weeks is only a suggested timeframe. As you will have the access to the lessons indefinitely, you can complete the course in 8 months or perhaps 8 years; it is totally up to you.\nDoes the course include supplies used to write calligraphy? No, as this is an online course, there are no supplies provided with the course. However, I teach how to create your own bamboo qalam and suggest brands/types of paper and ink you can purchase from any local art store.\nWill watching the videos be sufficient enough to have me write good calligraphy?Watching the videos alone will get you nowhere; watching the videos along with ample practice and completing the weekly homework will have you standing at your own feet by the end of the course. You will be ready to start creating your own calligraphy artwork inshaAllah.\nWill the instructor mark or grade my work for corrections? This course is designed as a self study guide. However I will be happy to answer any questions or provide guidance.\nWould you recommend this course over the book you have published? It's comparing apples and oranges; both resources have their own benefits. The course will allow you to learn live scripting while the book is a great reference guide for all scaling and measurements. The book also include 2 additional scripts that are not taught as part of the online course: Riq'a and Farsi.",

      "description": "This portrait drawing course will teach you how to draw beautiful, realistic portraits that capture the subject's likeness.\nWhat makes this course unique from all the others out there, is how it breaks down the complex topic of portrait drawing into manageable concepts and step-by-step exercises.\nYou'll begin by learning simple concepts and practicing basic drawing exercises. As your hand dexterity and understanding improve, the lessons will gradually increase in difficulty until, by the end of the course, you will have drawn your every one realistic portrait. Even if you are a beginner with no drawing experience, you'll find the lessons and exercises easy to understand and enjoyable, while still learning critical drawing skills.\nKey things you will learn:\nHow to simplify the head into basic shapes so you can draw it more easily\nHow to draw the head from different angles to create more dynamic portraits\nHow to draw the planes of the head in order to create a three-dimensional effect\nUnderstanding the rules of lighting in order to make your drawing look realistic\nUnderstanding the basic anatomy of each of the facial features so you can draw them better\nA simple step-by-step process for drawing a realistic portrait from start to finish\nAnd a whole lot more!\nCOURSE BONUSES:\nReference photos and hi-resolution scans of all finished drawings\nCourse Overview\nThis course is divided into 5 sections.\nThe first section is going to primarily focus on how to draw the head freehand. You'll learn about the very powerful Loomis Method and how to use to it draw a simplified head in the front, 3/4, and side view.\nThen we'll learn how to draw this same head and neck in more dynamic angles like the front view tilted down and up and 3/4 view tilted down and up. This will help you understand how the head is affected by perspective and allow you to tackle many different portrait positions.\nNext, you'll learn about the proportions of the head and features and how to place them on the face. This knowledge will become very useful in the next section where we'll build upon the Loomis Method to construct a more three-dimensional head.\nAgain, we'll cover all the different angles like the front, 3/4, and side view. As well as the more dynamic positions.\nOK, by now, you should be pretty comfortable with the overall structure of the head and in the third section, we'll cover the fundamentals of realistic shading. You'll learn about the 5 Elements of Shading and how to combine them to create a three-dimensional look. And you'll also learn about the 4 Different Types of Edges and the Rules of Realism and how to use them to add interest to your drawings. Then we'll combine all these concepts and techniques in a drawing exercise.\nNow, all these shading skills you've just learned will become very useful in the fourth section where you'll learn to draw each of the facial features.\nFirst, you're going to learn about the anatomy of the feature and point out little tips and details that you need to pay attention to. Then we'll apply everything we've just learned in a step-by-step drawing exercise. You'll see how to take the drawing from a basic lay-in all the way to a complete realistic finish.\nAnd we're going to do this for all the features: eye, nose, lips, ear, and hair.\nFinally in the fifth section, once you're comfortable with drawing all the features, we'll combine everything together and draw a complete portrait from start to finish. Even at this stage, you'll be learning some new techniques like how to use Triangulation to keep your lay-in accurate, how to accentuate the shadow to make the portrait more dramatic, how to stylize your drawing to add more interest, and so on.\nWho Is This Course For?\nAs the name suggests, this course is very beginner-friendly. I designed it to help beginning artists learn portrait drawing as quickly and effectively as possible.\nWe start out by developing the simplest skills first and then gradually add on to them so that you don't feel overwhelmed. All the concepts and techniques are throughout explained and I never just assume any knowledge on the part of the student.\nAlso, I know that draw free-hand can be a bit challenging for some beginners so, in some of the drawing exercises, I offer additional approaches that you can use as a guide.\nSo, yeah, if you're a beginning artist who wants to learn portraiture, then this course is definitely for you. On the other hand, if you're an intermediate to advanced portrait drawing artist, then this course is probably not for you.\n30-Day 100% Money-Back Guarantee\n\nRemember, there is a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee. There is no reason to hesitate. Enroll now, see if you enjoy the course, and start drawing beautiful portraits today!",

I share my own recipes for the soaps demonstrated to give you a start. You can use animal fats or make vegan soap.\nWith the knowledge you get from this course, you won't have to be limited to following other people's recipes - you will be able to create your own unique handcrafted soaps.\nSoapmaking is like any hobby - you can spend a fortune on it. However, in this course I will show you how to get started by using regular kitchen equipment and inexpensive ingredients that you can get in your local supermarket and health food store.\nYou will discover how to use household or dollar store items as molds, so that you can get started straight away at little or no cost. I will even show you how to make a wooden mold at a fraction of the cost of buying one.\nYou will see how to colour your soap with natural and cosmetic colours. The course will also show you a colour swirling technique, as well as how to make shampoo, shaving and an exfoliating soap.\nFAQs\nQ) What method of soap making is used in this course?\nA) This course covers Cold Process soap making.\nQ) Does this course cover Melt and Pour Soap making?\nA) No. This course shows you how to make soap from scratch using the Cold Process Method.\nQ) Does this course cover Hot Process Soap making?\nA) No the method taught in this course is Cold Process, although the basic method for Hot Process soap is discussed.\nQ) Does this course teach how to make soap without lye?\nA) No, you cannot make soap from scratch without using lye. You will be left with oils and water and NO soap.\nQ) Is this method of soap making suitable for children to do?\nA) Some people allow their children to do soap making, however that is usually using the Melt and Pour method. The lye in Cold Process soap making is caustic and will burn the skin, so I would not recommend children or animals to be around while soap making.\nQ) What if I run into problems while making my soap?\nA) I have highlighted all the important things that you need to know. However, if you do have any problems I'll be there in the discussion area, ready to help you",

The interlacing and tiling will take longer. As you work through the course, you will develop your compass and ruler and construction skills. Each pattern is a level up from the previous.\nYou will need a compass, ruler, pencil, plain paper, tracing paper, eraser and masking tape.  I also use watercolour pencils and an aquabrush. However, you will gain enough skills to be able to transfer a pattern to the surface of your choice - how you add the colour is up to you, colouring pens or pencils, paints and beyond!\nThis course is aimed at beginners with an interest in the geometric patterns they have seen in and around the Islamic world and beyond. Many people haven't used a compass since their school days, if that's you, you can rediscover all the potential it holds.\nAll the videos on this course feature a remixed version of the song \"Montmartre\" by Jahzzar, from the Free Music Archive used under CC BY-SA 3.0",

      "description": "Are you looking to learn the art of comic book coloring and learn the secrets, tips, and tricks that can make coloring comics a fun hobby, a part­-time job, or maybe even a career? This beginner course is great place to start!\nThis course will teach you the basics of comic book coloring with Photoshop - setting up your tools, flatting, rendering, & special effects.\nWhat is a colorist? After the penciller completes the line­art (and many times an inker finishes the pencils with ink), the art is passed to the colorist (or \"color artist\" as it's sometimes called). Colorists, like all comic book creators, can work from anywhere in the world. I've worked with artists and writers the world over right from my home office. The Internet makes it easy to connect with collaborators worldwide.\nColorists are the cinematographers of the comic book world. The pencillers are the directors ­­setting up shots, creating the camera angles, shooting the action. Colorists are lighting the scenes, setting the final look of the page, and helping to move the story along with color.\nCourse materials will include:\nBlack and white line art from professional comic book penciller Max Dunbar to color along with the lecture videos.\nDownloadable Photoshop presets (version CS6 or CC only)\nColor profiles to ensure proper color reproduction for web and print use.\nPhotoshop Actions to automate certain aspects of the coloring process.\nColor swatches: A palette of preset colors ­­exactly as the instructor uses them for his published work.\n3.5 hours of instructional videos featuring real-time coloring by professional comic book colorist K Michael Russell\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have learned the skills required to use Photoshop as a tool to create stunning colored comic book pages, manga, web-comics, or comic strips.\nThe instructor, K. Michael Russell, is a colorist currently working for Image Comics & Top Cow.\nNote that this course was recorded in 2014 and could be considered \"version 1.0\" of my coloring courses. My course \"A Pro's Guide to Digital Comic Book Coloring\" is version 2.0.",

Broderick's teaching style is engaging, easy to follow and fun! I began painting in April 2020 after enrolling in a mixed media course on Udemy and fell in love with watercolors and inks. Since then, I've participated in several in-person workshops and other online classes/academies, and recently decided to give Udemy another go for watercolor painting. I found Broderick's Watercolor for Beginner's class and after watching the intro video I was hooked! About halfway through the beginner's course, I found this Next Level course and immediately enrolled. Both have been phenomenal and I am really enjoying his teaching and artistic style  - Tiffany White\n\n\nDo you want to take your painting to the next level?\nThe secret ingredient to improving the way you paint is\n\n\nMORE water!\n\n\nDid you know that the same water you use to mix your paints with can be used as another tool in your watercolor toolbox?\nUsing more water when your paint, can give your work a more organic look, with very little effort.\nYou just need to set up the right conditions then, let the water do what it wants, and I'm here to show you how!\n\nWHO AM I?\nHey there! Broderick here and I paint in watercolor professionally,\nfrom simple character designs, to realism, to fun art, even fine art pieces hanging in Museums in Europe.\n\n\nI’ve been a featured artist for a major art supply chain\n\n\nSocial media loves my quirky watercolor pet portraits\n\n\nPlaced first in live watercolor painting competitions (2016 Harmony Festival Plein Air Champion ; 2018 Grand Prix Plein Air Masters Division Champion)\n\n\nThe Fabriano InAcquarello 2020, an international watercolor painting conference hosted in Italy,\ninvited me to do an online painting demonstration as an international artist.\n\n\nI’m also the creator of Watercolors for beginners here on Udemy, a best seller course taken by over 9,000 people with over 400 reviews.\n\nNow I’m excited to show you how to take your watercolors and rise to the next level!\n\n\nWHY LEARN FROM ME?\nWhen I felt I knew enough, I wanted to paint everything, from landscapes to animals, to portraits and urban scenes, but I quickly realized that every step I took forward, I took 4 steps back. It was such a strange, unusual experience which made me rethink how I had been painting.\nI ruined many watercolor paintings trying to paint in a different style. I experienced many happy accidents, but didn’t know how to recreate them successfully. I persevered and took a handful of workshops and, over a brief period, I realized that there are levels to watercolors!\nFast forward to today, if I could have kick-started a path to success for myself to follow, to learn watercolor painting quicker without making so many mistakes, what would that look like? Through my experience in teaching myself and others, I have found the one thing that unlocks the full potential of watercolors and it is with this awareness that I present to you:\n\nWatercolor Painting: Next Level Techniques and Water Effects\n\n\nI really enjoyed the beginners course, and this one just takes off where the other left off. Already in the very first lesson I am learning something. I really enjoy this instructor's courses, its fun and informative, and would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in painting with watercolors. Schantel Fick\n\n\nWHO IS THIS FOR?\nIf you're comfortable with the basic rules of watercolor, then you're going to have fun breaking these rules\nand have the confidence to produce different effects that can't be achieved knowing the basics alone.\n\n\nREADY TO PAINT DIFFERENTLY AND DIVE INTO SOMETHING NEW?\n\n\nTHE PROBLEMS WITH LEARNING\n\nThere are lots of materials that some would use, from salts to soaps, stamps to cellophane, from wax to markers, to metallic paints and colored pencils. While they can be used to produce different effects they can:\n\n\nBe quite costly to buy\nAffect the longevity of your painting\nTake up so much space on your table\nMay compromise your development of proper technique and application\n\n\nMY SOLUTIONS TO LEARNING\n\nIf I showed you an easier way to achieve more with less, using only water, does that sound good?\nYou will learn special applications I developed that will help you control your water, then let go of that control, allowing the water to paint the painting with you. This gives your painting that fresh, fluid, “just painted” look even long after its dried. Using no extraneous materials, only water.\nMy Watercolor Painting: Next Level Techniques and Water Effects course is all about painting Wet On Wet. What is Wet On Wet? Have a look at one the free preview videos to get a better idea of how to put the W.O.W. (Wet On Wet) in your paintings!\n\n\nYou will learn the difference between Wet on Dry and W.O.W. painting\n\n\nThere will be 4 new W.O.W. techniques, that you can look forward to, allowing you to control your water and let go of that control, to let the water paint the painting with you\n\n\nMy 4 Phases of Wetness will teach you how to intuitively know to keep on painting or when to stop\n\n\nThis course includes everything that I teach in my live Wet On Wet workshops, ($260 total value)\nAdditional, bonus paint along videos to get more practice after the course\n\n\nWHAT IS YOUR COURSE LIKE?\nIf you’ve taken different classes before but still have a hard time controlling watercolor or painting loose, my Watercolor Painting: Next Level Techniques and Water Effects course can help:\n\n\n1) SHORT LASER-FOCUSED LESSONS\n\nMy live watercolor painting workshops have given me the opportunity to target and isolate very specific challenges about the painting process,\nfrom a learner’s point of view, and then break them down into short laser-focused lessons.\nI found that these challenges are multi-layered and overlapping,\nmaking it difficult to know where to begin.\n\nThis is why you may feel you’re taking 1 step forward and 4 steps back.\n\nMy Watercolor Painting: Next Level Techniques and Water Effects course peels away those layers,\nthen simplifies them into short focused lessons,\nallowing you to learn only what you need to know at that time, to get you to the next level.\nSucceeding lessons will have their own short, focused sessions that gradually build on top of the previous.\n\n\n2) LEARN WITHOUT THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD\n● I’ve distilled traditional art theory & practice into their fundamental essence\n● I use easy to understand language (aka no artsy fartsy terminologies)\n● I thoughtfully produce my material and content: Straight to the point. No extra fluff.\n\n\n3) SEQUENTIAL LEARNING\nThe way information is presented, oddly enough, has an enormous impact on what you learn,\nhow fast you learn and how you apply it. (Sometimes whether you learn at all!)\nI designed this course to build new information on top of what you already know. Think Lego.\n\n\n● New lessons introduce new techniques & reinforce what you learned in previous lessons\n● Lessons include carefully designed activities to match the skill level\n● Lessons are concise but packed with only relevant information\n\nI'm glad I took this course. I've been frustrated trying to learn watercolors on my own. But because of this, I become even more excited with this medium. Thanks!  Riamarie San Jose\n\n\n4) NO SECOND GUESSING!\nKnowing differs from understanding.\nRandom tips and tricks are good for 1-time activities,\nbut have you tried painting something else after\nand felt like it sent you straight back to kindergarten?\nI've been there before. (A few times actually. Sigh.)\nYou need a stronger foundation to fall back on.\nUnderstanding what you’re doing with your watercolor will take you much further.\n\n\n● Too much control = Overworked, muddy paintings\n● Too much spontaneity = One big-happy-accident-type-of-paintings\n● Controlled spontaneity = Fresh, glowing, transparent paintings\n\n\n5) LET GO OF THE FEAR OF STARTING\n\nI need to tidy up my work space\nThose plants look like they need a little drink today\nThe cat needs…another bath!\n\n\nThe fear of uncertainty encourages procrastination.\nWhat if I told you that all you need to do, is to just set up the right conditions and let the water paint it for you, would you give it a try?\n\nI'm not even halfway through the course, but I have learned so much already about CONTROLLING the water in wet on wet watercolor painting. Thank you, Broderick! You are a masterful teacher. Diana D\n\n\n6) HAVE FUN WHILE YOU LEARN!\n\n\nThere’s painting for fun, and then there’s painting to learn while having fun.\nThe course videos are professionally produced to educate and entertain.\nThis balance ensures a variety of presentations, instruction, humor and pacing!\n\n● Painting for fun = Just playing with paints, there is not much technique to take away.\n● Painting to learn = Heavy on theory and drills.\n● Painting to learn while having fun equips you with what you need to know, right away, so you can enjoy the watercolor painting process more.\n\n\nHOW ELSE CAN I HELP YOU?\n\n\nI’m here to help you think like water.\nThe more you understand, the less uncertainty there is, the more excited you will be to paint.\nYou will first learn how to control your watercolor.\nThen I’ll show you how to just let it do what it wants.\nThis is what I call, Controlled Spontaneity: A give and take between you and the watercolor.\nYou will learn how to use water, to do different wet on wet techniques, ones that are a far departure from beginner techniques.\n\n\nYes: this has been a good match. The instructor is very clear with instructions. The video work is exceptional!! - Jason Poole\n\n\n\nQ1: I don’t have strong drawing skills, should I take a drawing class first?\nYou don’t need to know how to draw.\nSince the focus of the lessons are about painting and not drawing,\nI will teach you a quick and easy way to sketch (that even kids can do!)\nso you can start painting right away.\n\n\nQ2: I had done so little watercolor painting before and I quit from frustration. What makes your course different from others?\n\nMy course is professionally produced:\n● All videos are shot in high definition\n● Over the head shots showing my entire set up\n● Close-up shots for color mixing\n● Clear and consistent audio/commentary\n● Combination of energetic and relaxed pacing\n● Casual conversations vs. formal lectures\n● Receive the information in small segments. No over explaining.\n● Animation/Visual Cues to let you know where I want you to focus on\n● Fun activities with new challenges in each lesson to build up technique and application\n\n\nThis is not your typical, traditional course.\nMy live watercolor painting workshops have allowed me to refine the lessons into what they are today,\nbreaking down the watercolor process even more into its most essential concepts.\n\nQ3: Things are quite busy with work/kids/life. What if I don’t finish the lesson?\nThese lessons are available anytime you need them, wherever you are in the world.\nLearn at your own pace as long as you have a computer and an internet connection.\n\nSo, are you ready to level up instead of painting happy accidents?\n\n\nThen enroll now! I can’t wait to help you put the W.O.W. In your paintings using only color & water!\n\n\nLove watching your course B, I’m learning so much!! Wet on wet painting with watercolors has always been a mystery to me. My many unsuccessful attempts have left me wondering how artists consistently achieve these gorgeous, subtle, organic effects. He shares his method for painting these effects effortlessly and beautifully, step by step and makes it so much fun and memorable along the way.  Sooo glad I will no longer be hoping for accidents that will go “right\". Now I have a much better understanding of how to create the paintings I want thanks to his easy to understand method and clear explanations. Love his scientific explanations and little stories about his subjects, he is so engaging! Thanks Broderick, for unveiling the magical mysteries of wet on wet painting!! Caroline",

You're free to use your own style of materials of course, but I'll list every single thing I use. I also provide a PDF flipbook showing each stage of the painting, so you can flip through quickly and see how the painting builds with each stage.\n\nThis course is partial toward using oil paint, and I highly recommend it, however you can use acrylics also.

Each tool used and each stage of the process is broken down into lessons, so that you can easily follow along using methods I've honed over years working as a comic book colorist. These techniques can be used in almost any art style -- not just comics by the way.\nLessons are full of tips, tricks, and shortcuts from the basics of setting up layers and preparing line art to functions such as masking and correction layers. You'll be taken through all of the important program settings, how to setup up a line drawing, adding the base colors, adding light and shadow in a variety of ways, and how to use CLIP STUDIO PAINT's tools and functions in a mix of creative ways.\nThe method I'm teaching for adding light and shadow can be used in any lighting scenario, so you'll be able to take what you've learned in this course and apply it to your own art. I've also included my version of the finished exercise with all of the layers intact, so you can see exactly which colors I'm picking and how all of the layers work together to create one cohesive piece of art!\nI'm also including my Auto-Actions as well as some basic tool presets for you to use, so you don't have to fiddle around with CLIP's many tool settings. They intimidated me for a while! Many of the coloring techniques taught in the course can be applied to other apps like Photoshop or Procreate as well. I've been a hardcore Photoshop user for many years, and the more I use CLIP, the more things I miss when I go back to Photoshop these days.\nIf you get stuck, you can always ask questions in the included discussion area, and I'll be there to help ASAP.\nI look forward to seeing you in the course!\n-- Kurt Michael Russell, instructor",

      "description": "Welcome to The Artmother's Drawing Masterclass!\nDrawing is a skill anyone can learn! It is the most important building block of all art - illustration, graphic design, fine art and even animation starts with sketches and drawings! If you are the person who always though he can't learn drawing, even if you are already into some medium, like watercolors, you are in the right place!\nAs a professional art teacher with a Master's Degree in Art Education, in the last 10 years I watched people form all age categories learn drawing. In the last year I was researching the perfect methodology to teach a very beginner art fundamentals and I combined all these experiences and also the feedback from my first drawing course to create a comprehensive Masterclass.\nRead some Reviews to see what others think about the course!\n\"This was a great class! The Artmother really took the time to explain things for a beginner, and gave an inspiring speech at the end of class. She is very thorough, and a great teacher. Enjoyed all her practice sessions and doing the different projects after each lesson. Thank you!\"  Joan Canning\n\n\n\"This class is gold! I could actually follow through the process. The teacher is very objective on the instructions and I could (finally!) draw something that I'm proud. I really recommend this to beginners. Thank you for the amazing class!\" Jordana Lia\n\n\nIn this course our focus is to explore your inner symbol set, roots of your style, your relationship to drawing and the ways you LOVE to draw, styles that you are most into and try to get the most out of it! We will start with as simple things as drawing lines and build it up to creating shapes and forms.\nIn this class you will learn:\n- to draw lines with different properties, rhythm and weight\n- to hold the pencil in a stable and comfortable way\n- to create an artwork entirely from lines\n- to draw basic geometric shapes in order to build up more complex shapes\n- to create forms from shapes (sphere, cone, cube)\n- to apply values\n- to shade with the \"Reverse Shading Method\"\n- to create the illusion of space in your artworks by applying linear perspective\n- to draw the different parts of the face\n- to draw basic facial proportions\n- to let out your personal symbol set and explore how you like to draw\n- to draw with confidence\n- different areas of some visual industries where you can apply your beginner level skills\n\n\nThis Masterclass also includes bonus courses:\n1. 10 Projects for Better Observation\nIn this class I have designed 10 Projects to get your Observational skills from copying nonsense lines to an appropriately drawn and shaded statue drawing. The class includes a 25 Page PDF Resource.\nIn this class you will learn:\n- to copy lines and shapes from one surface to another using reference points\n- to draw the outlines of an object with the help of measuring\n- to get the character of an image by drawing the most important lines, curves and angles first\n- to observe shadows and draw a real object in its real proportions\n- to find the basic geometric shapes in complex forms\n- to morph basic geometric shape compositions to appropriate contour lines\n- to use the grid method\n- to draw an image from a reference photo in a bigger scale\n\n\n2. Creative Shading - Learn Six Shading Techniques for Better Drawing Skills\nIs \"shading\" a word that freaks you out? Are you stuck with it and can't progress in your art? You still don't get how it works? Where to put lines, crossing lines, can you even use your finger to smudge the graphite?\nDon't worry!\nIn this class, you will learn the most well known shading techniques - the Blending (Tonal) Shading, Hatching, Cross-Hatching, Smudging, Stippling and Scribbling!\nWe are going to go through all of them in a general overview, then also in detail so that you can see these techniques in action! We are going to shade 6 spheres with all these techniques, then at the end, we will choose one and apply it to a subject of your choice!\nThe class is focused on pencil shading, but we will also discuss shading with ink.\nIn this class you will learn:\n- which pencils are appropriate for which shading\n- how to control your pencil - including pressure control, angles, rhythm, making marks\n- how to layer graphite\n- how to shade with graphite as a medium\n- how to shade with lines and marks\n- what is value and how to create change in it\n- how to do blending (tonal) shading\n- how to shade with hatching, cross-hatching, 3 layered and 4 layered hatching, contour hatching and contour cross hatching\n- how to work with graphite as a medium in shading with smudging\n- to create value change with controlling mark frequency in stippling\n- to shade with freedom in scribbling\n- to shade with fun:)\nSo, what are you waiting for? Jump right in to the class!\nThe masterclass is ideal for very beginners, with zero experience with drawing. If you are the person whose automatic reply to the question \"Can you draw xzy?\" is an automatic NO (even when playing Activity), YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE:)\nEven if you are already painting with different kinds of mediums, like watercolors, acrylics of digital, but you are questioning whether you need to learn drawing in order to do your craft, THIS MIGHT BE THE COURSE FOR YOU!\nIf you are ready to learn what you always wished for but never had courage or procrastinated over it, this is the time to ENROLL!\nSee you inside!\nAlexandra\nThe Artmother",
